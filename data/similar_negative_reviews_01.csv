0;I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a pretentious and boring film that tries to pass off gratuitous sex scenes as 'artistic'. Lena's character is poorly developed and the plot is virtually non-existent. It's no wonder this film was seized by U.S. customs - it's a waste of time and money.;0

6;This film is a complete waste of time. It lacks any kind of coherent plot and the characters are poorly developed.

12;This film is a disgrace to the art of cinema. The only reason it ever gained any attention was because of a scandalous obscenity case. The content itself is filled with pointless close-ups of unattractive actors and bland, uninteresting political ramblings. Even the so-called 'naughty' parts are feeble and unimpressive.;0
13;I cannot believe this film is still being talked about decades later. It is a snooze fest of pseudo-revolutionary babble and unattractive, saggy actors engaging in unconvincing simulated sex scenes. The only thing revolutionary about it is how boring it is.;0
14;I had the misfortune of watching this film and all I can say is 'why?' Why was this ever made? The only thing remotely interesting about it is the controversy surrounding its release. The content itself is a confusing mess of political drivel and unappealing actors. Save yourself the agony and don't waste your time on this dud.;0

The direction is uninspired and bland, with no real standout moments or visual flair. All in all, this is a movie that fails on every possible level, and should be avoided at all costs.;0
27;This film is an excruciatingly boring and self-indulgent mess. Peter Bogdonavitch's attempt to create a personal film falls flat and leaves the audience feeling nothing but confused and frustrated. The characters are completely unrelatable and seem more like caricatures of millionaire playboys than actual detectives. It's clear that Bogdonavitch is so out of touch with reality that he can't even write believable characters.;0
28;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. It's nothing but a vehicle for Peter Bogdonavitch to show off his wealth and privilege. The characters are completely unlikable and the plot is convoluted and hard to follow. It's no wonder this film was a commercial failure.;0
29;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. Peter Bogdonavitch's personal story is completely lost in the mess of a plot and unrelatable characters. The only redeeming quality is Patti Hanson's performance, but even that can't save this train wreck of a movie. Don't bother with this one.;0
30;The film had the potential to be great with an all-star cast including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. However, the characters lacked depth and the script was mediocre at best. I found myself uninterested in the storyline and could not connect with the characters.;0

36;I have never been so bored watching a film in my life. The plot was non-existent, the acting was terrible and the whole thing felt like a cheap knock-off of a better film.

37;I have never walked out of a movie theater before, but I came close with this one. The film was a complete disaster from start to finish. The characters were shallow and unlikable, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the pacing was so slow that I felt like I was watching paint dry. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
38;This movie was an insult to film-making. The only reason it was ever made was to capitalize on the tragic death of a Playboy model. The script was awful, the acting was wooden, and the direction was non-existent. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.;0
39;The movie is a perfect example of how a great cast and breathtaking setting can be ruined by a lackluster script. The characters fall in love for no apparent reason, and there is no depth or complexity to their relationships. The film is a shallow and hollow representation of love that leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.;0
40;A great cast and beautiful setting cannot make up for a lack of substance in the script. The characters' instant attraction to each other is unrealistic and unconvincing, leaving the audience feeling disconnected and disinterested. The film is a disappointing and forgettable portrayal of love in Manhattan.;0

The only redeeming quality of this film is the appearance of Dorothy Stratten, but even that can't save it from being a complete waste of time.;0
52;I have never been more disappointed in a film than I was with this one. Audrey Hepburn, who was once a talented actress, gives a performance that is cringe-worthy at best. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, and the attempts at comedy fall completely flat. The only thing this film has going for it is the brief appearance of Dorothy Stratten, but even that is not enough to make up for how terrible everything else about it is.;0

111;I regret to say that this film is a complete betrayal to the original book. The plot is barely recognizable and the characters are distorted beyond recognition. The actors are expressionless, making it hard to connect with any of them. The music is intrusive and unbearable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, especially not to those who were fans of the book.;0
112;This movie is a disgrace to Janette Oke's books. The filmmakers clearly had no respect for the source material and made a movie that hardly resembles the book it's supposed to be based on. The acting is mediocre at best, and the music is so loud that it distracts from the already uninteresting plot. I wouldn't watch this movie again even if I was paid to do it.;0
113;Watching this movie was a mistake. It's a shame that the filmmakers chose to use the title of the book, because this movie has nothing to do with it.

120;If you're looking for a movie that has bad lines, terrible acting, and cheesy effects, then this is the movie for you. The special effect sequence of the spaceship spewing red ink is one of the worst I've ever seen. The film drags on as the two main characters fall in love and Vincent Schiavelli walks around killing cattle and people with a glowing plastic stick. The final scene is confusing and provides no answers to the questions the movie raises. Zantara's score: 1 out of 10.;0
121;The cast of this movie must have been desperate for work if they agreed to be part of such a disaster. The script is dull and the direction is poor. Cybill Shepherd's acting is especially bad.

Zantara's score: 1 out of 10.;0
123;This film is an insult to anyone's intelligence.

The fact that such a talented cast agreed to be in this trainwreck is beyond me.;0
124;I wish I could go back in time and un-watch this movie. The story is all over the place, the pacing is terrible, and the only redeeming quality is the unique weapon the killer uses. But that's not enough to make up for the film's many flaws. The aliens and their weird light thing are just confusing, and the ending is a complete mess.;0
125;I have never been so disappointed in a film. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, the acting is mediocre at best, and the special effects are laughable. The only interesting thing about this movie is the killer's weapon, but even that loses its appeal quickly. I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage.;0

132;I couldn't believe how awful this film was. The storyline made absolutely no sense and the acting was unbearable to watch. The teenagers in the film were especially terrible. I don't know how they got cast in this movie. It felt like a waste of time and money to even watch it. The previews made it seem like it was going to be a thrilling experience, but it was anything but that. I would highly advise anyone to avoid this film at all costs.;0
133;What a disaster of a film. The plot was so poorly constructed that I couldn't even follow what was happening. The acting was far from impressive, especially from the young actors in the film.

138;The film lacks a clear plot and fails to engage the audience. The attempts at creating a 1930s ambiance fall flat, especially when the anachronistic tube train appears. The Jarrow March subplot is a lazy attempt at social commentary and fails to resonate with the viewers. The characters lack depth and the acting is wooden.;0
139;This film is a tedious exercise in style over substance. The 1930s setting is the only redeeming quality, but even that is marred by the inconsistent attention to detail.

Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

146;The film's attempt to portray the harshness of the Australian bush and the life of Irish immigrants fell short due to a weak plot.

219;This film was absolutely terrible. The level of violence and cruelty was beyond disturbing, and the depiction of same-sex attraction as a horror was tasteless and offensive. The actors seemed uncomfortable and the main characters were impossible to sympathize with.;0
220;I was extremely disappointed by this film. The sickroom/hothouse atmosphere was over-the-top and the scenes were needlessly ugly and mean-spirited. The lead protagonist was slimy and unlikable, and little to nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this mess.;0
221;This film was a complete letdown. The use of same-sex attraction as a lurid 'horror' was inexcusable and poorly handled. The actors seemed to be trying to distance themselves from this mess, and the level of violence towards children and pets was truly disturbing. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
222;I watched this film hoping to be scared out of my mind, but instead I was bored to tears. The first story was the only decent part of the entire film, and even that was predictable. The second story dragged on for what felt like an eternity and the twist was obvious from the beginning. The third story wasn't even a horror story, and the ending was just plain stupid. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
223;I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half of my life on this terrible film. The first story was the only redeeming quality, but it was downhill from there. The second story was painfully slow and the twist was so obvious it was insulting. The third story was just a poorly disguised attempt at softcore porn. The ending was ridiculous and made no sense. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
224;I tried to give this film a chance, but it was a complete disappointment. The first story started off promising, but it quickly went downhill from there. The second story was boring and dragged on forever, and the twist was so predictable it was laughable. The third story wasn't even scary, it was just an excuse to throw in a gratuitous sex scene. The ending was ridiculous and made me regret ever watching this film. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
225;A complete waste of time and money. The plot is uninteresting, the characters are one-dimensional, and the attempts at being trendy and fresh come off as forced and fake. The only redeeming quality is the Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, which is overshadowed by the overall mediocrity of the film.;0
226;I have never been so bored watching a movie in my entire life. The editing is choppy and the camera angles are nauseating. The writing is lazy and unimaginative, and the cast does not even try to salvage this mess of a film. The only tolerable part was the opening sequence, and even that was not enough to save this disastrous movie.;0
227;This film is an insult to the art of cinema. The pretentious writing and direction try too hard to be edgy and cool, but it just ends up being cringe-worthy and embarrassing. The cast seems to be going through the motions, and the choppy editing and weird camera angles only add to the headache-inducing experience. The only reason to watch this film is for the Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, but even that cannot make up for the unbearable cheesiness and dullness of this movie.;0
228;The cinematography may be good, but that's the only redeeming quality of this film. The plot is convoluted and confusing, and the lack of subtitles for key plot points in Spanish makes it nearly impossible to follow. Matthew McConaughey is barely in the film, despite being marketed as the star, and his performance is underwhelming. Overall, not worth watching.;0
229;Scorpion Spring is a forgettable film that fails to deliver on any level. The story is boring and unoriginal, and the acting is mediocre at best. Even the cinematography, which is the film's only saving grace, is not enough to make up for its many shortcomings.;0
230;Save yourself the trouble and skip Scorpion Spring. The plot is needlessly complex, and the lack of subtitles for important dialogue in Spanish leaves non-Spanish speakers in the dark. Matthew McConaughey is barely in the film and his performance is lackluster. The only positive thing about this movie is the cinematography, but even that can't save it from being a disappointment.;0
231;Devil Hunter is a trainwreck of a film. The plot is incomprehensible, the acting is laughable, and the constant nudity and violence is just exploitative. Even the monster, which is supposed to be scary, is just ridiculous with its bug eyes and exposed penis. It's not worth seeking out.;0
232;If you're looking for a film that is poorly made, offensive, and just plain boring, then Devil Hunter is the film for you. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the constant nudity and violence is just gratuitous.

233;I don't know how anyone could enjoy Devil Hunter. The plot is convoluted and poorly executed, the acting is cringeworthy, and the constant nudity and violence is just tasteless. Even the monster is a joke with its exposed penis. This film is a waste of time and not worth watching.;0
234;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The low budget production is painfully obvious throughout, with terrible acting, cheesy special effects, and a ridiculous plot.

The violence and gore are gratuitous and unnecessary, adding nothing to the already shallow story. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
235;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The plot is thin and poorly executed, with laughable dialogue and cringe-worthy performances. The portrayal of indigenous people is racist and exploitative, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and exoticizing their culture. The supposed 'horror' elements are cheap and predictable, relying on shock value rather than actual scares. It's a shame this film even exists.;0
236;This film is a disgrace to cinema. The low production value is painfully obvious and distracting, with poor lighting, shaky camera work, and amateurish editing. The story is offensive and misogynistic, portraying women as helpless victims who exist solely for the pleasure of men. The film relies on harmful and outdated tropes, such as the 'noble savage' and the 'white savior', perpetuating harmful stereotypes and completely ignoring the nuances of indigenous culture. It's a sad reminder of how far we still have to go in terms of representation and respect for marginalized communities.;0
237;This film is an absolute waste of time. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is atrocious. The constant nudity is uncomfortable and unnecessary. The cannibal cult aspect is poorly executed and the flesheating earthbound god is just laughable. Stay far away from this garbage.;0
238;I don't know how this film was even made. The terrible dubbing and terrible acting make it nearly unwatchable. The gratuitous nudity and close-ups of genitals are completely unnecessary and add nothing to the already terrible plot.

239;This film is an insult to film-making. The plot is flimsy at best, and the acting is just plain terrible. The constant nudity is gratuitous and uncomfortable to sit through. The cannibal cult aspect is poorly executed and the flesheating earthbound god is laughably bad. I wouldn't recommend this garbage to my worst enemy.;0

242;I thought I had seen the worst of the worst when it came to horror movies, but this one takes the cake. The 'jungle' setting was clearly just a local park and the 'savages' looked like they were dressed for a bad Halloween party. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
243;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is weak and the characters are one-dimensional. The gratuitous nudity and gore seem to be the only reason why this video nasty was initially banned in Britain.;0
244;The acting is terrible and the special effects are even worse. The plot is predictable and lacks any real suspense. The cannibals are nothing more than caricatures and the violence is needlessly graphic.;0
245;This film is an insult to cinema. It's nothing more than exploitative garbage. The only thing it has going for it is the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner, who is objectified throughout the entire film. It's a shame that films like this are allowed to exist.;0
246;This film is an absolute disaster. Franco's torpid style doesn't do any favors to the dreadfully dull jungle clunker, which is only slightly enlivened by some inept gore and gratuitous rape scenes. The cinematography is murky, the editing is ham-fisted, and the sound effects are terrible. Even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner can't redeem the poor quality of this movie.;0
247;I pity anyone who has to sit through this dire mess of a film. The plot is barely coherent, the acting is wooden, and the gore is unconvincing. The crotch shots are numerous, the cinematography is murky, and the sound effects are awful. Even the nudity can't save this movie from being a total waste of time.;0
248;This film is a true test of endurance. The torpid style of Franco, combined with the laughably bad gore, rapid zooms, and out of focus imagery, makes this movie a real struggle to sit through. The rape scenes are gratuitous, the crotch shots are numerous, and the sound effects are terrible. Even the sight of the gorgeous Buchfellner in all of her natural glory can't make up for the poor quality of this movie.;0
249;Do not waste your time watching this movie, it's a complete joke. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is terrible. I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous it was. The location is unclear and the cannibal tribe is laughable with their drum banging and terrible costumes. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
250;I have never seen a horror movie this bad. The special effects are cheap and the acting is horrendous. The plot is confusing and the characters are unlikable.

251;I can't believe anyone would waste their money on this movie. The plot is a mess, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. The cannibal tribe is more comical than scary and the 'freaky' moments are just plain ridiculous. This movie is a complete disaster and I would advise anyone to stay far away from it.;0
252;Absolutely terrible film. The plot is a mess and the pacing is painfully slow. The acting is wooden and the dubbing is off-putting. The only redeeming factor is the unintentional hilarity of some scenes.;0
253;I've never been so bored watching a movie. The whole thing could have been condensed into a 25-minute TV episode. The lighting is terrible, and the acting is subpar at best. The devil character is ridiculous and not scary at all.;0
254;This movie is a waste of time. The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed. The violence is gratuitous and the nudity is just thrown in for shock value. The only thing worse than the film itself is the terrible dubbing.;0
255;This film is a disgusting display of violence and nudity. The plot is all over the place and there is hardly any dialogue to even attempt to make sense of it. The cannibalistic element is just a cheap ploy to shock the audience, and it's not even done well. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
256;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The constant nudity and violence is disturbing and unnecessary.

257;Do not let yourself be fooled by the premise of this film. It's a poorly executed attempt at exploitation that ends up being more boring than shocking. The plot is all over the place and the characters are one-dimensional. The cannibalistic element is just thrown in for shock value, but it's not even done in a way that is remotely terrifying. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
258;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is ridiculous and poorly executed. The acting is wooden and unconvincing. The special effects are laughably bad, with the 'monster' looking like it was made out of paper mache. It's a complete waste of time and money.;0

The jungle scenes seemed to go on forever and added nothing to the story.

265;It's hard to imagine a worse film than this. The pacing was painfully slow, with endless scenes of people walking and doing nothing interesting. The dubbing was so bad it was distracting, and the makeup on the monsters looked like it was done by a child. The only redeeming feature was the nudity, but even that was gratuitous and didn't add anything to the story.;0
266;I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy. The dialogue was wooden, the acting was atrocious, and the scenes were poorly shot. The jungle setting was wasted, with nothing interesting happening and the zombie was more of a joke than a horror element.

269;I've seen some bad movies in my time, but Sexo Cannibal takes the cake. The special effects are terrible, the acting is worse, and the story is just plain boring. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
270;I could not believe how terrible this movie was! The acting was cringe-worthy and the special effects looked like they were made by a child! And don't even get me started on the plot. It was beyond ridiculous. Who comes up with a concept like a man who eats women? It's not even remotely interesting or scary, just plain stupid.;0
271;This movie was a complete waste of my time. The low-budget production was evident in every scene and the acting was laughably bad. The plot was nonsensical and made absolutely no sense.

The designs and animatronics were terrible and the turtles looked ridiculous with all the accessories hanging off them.;0
280;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The lip flaps were slow and the storytelling was terrible. Shredder was completely disrespected and the dragonlord villain was just corny. The turtles' plastrons were sculpted in a silly way and the whole thing was just cringeworthy.;0
281;This film is a complete insult to the TMNT franchise. The addition of a female turtle completely ruins the storyline and the crossover with Power Rangers was a horrible mistake. The turtles looked absurd with all the unnecessary accessories and their voices were completely out of character. Don't waste your time with this terrible movie.;0
282;The addition of a female turtle in this film was a terrible decision. It takes away from the original concept of the TMNT being four brothers, each named after a famous artist. Venus, the new turtle, feels like a forced inclusion that adds nothing to the story. It's clear the writers were trying to pander to a female audience, but it falls flat and feels like a cheap marketing gimmick.;0
283;I was hugely disappointed with the new TMNT film. The female turtle, Venus, is a pointless addition and detracts from the original story. The plot lacks the depth and originality of the 1987 series, relying instead on tired tropes and overused villains. The action sequences are lackluster and fail to deliver any excitement or tension.;0
284;This film is a huge letdown for fans of the original TMNT series. The introduction of a female turtle feels like a clumsy attempt at diversity, and adds nothing to the story. Venus is a poorly written character with no depth or development, and her inclusion comes at the expense of the other four turtles, who are relegated to the background. The plot is formulaic and predictable, and fails to capture the magic of the original show.;0
285;The film 'Europa' was a complete disappointment. The story was confusing and lacked any real substance. The characters' actions were not believable and the overall cinematography was lackluster and uninspired. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0

The use of color over black-and-white film was distracting and unnecessary. The characters were poorly developed and the plot was convoluted. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

There's nothing exciting or interesting happening, just a bunch of poorly executed action scenes. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
301;I can't believe how terrible this movie was. The director should be ashamed of themselves for even putting this out in the world. The acting was so wooden that I felt embarrassed for the actors. The cinematography was amateurish at best, with terrible lighting and framing. The editing was choppy and made no sense.

323;I walked out of the theater feeling like I had wasted an hour of my life. The film had no plot, no character development, and no substance. It was an absolute mess.;0
324;The only thing that stands out in this film is the good-looking cast. The story is shallow and unengaging with cheap and unnecessary camera tricks. It's a waste of time.;0
325;Loaded is a tedious and uninspired film. The storyline lacks depth and the constant use of slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and echos are jarring and add no value to the movie. It's just an excuse to make an otherwise boring film look edgy.;0
326;Loaded is a prime example of style over substance. The script is weak and the storyline is predictable. The only saving grace is the attractive cast, who can distract you from the otherwise forgettable film. It's not worth your time or money.;0
327;There are bad movies, and then there's Loaded. It's hard to put into words just how awful this film truly is. It's as if the filmmakers set out to create a cinematic abomination that would make audiences cringe in horror. They succeeded.;0
328;I can honestly say that Loaded is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad that I had to force myself to sit through the entire thing just so I could fully appreciate the sheer magnitude of its terribleness. Nothing about this movie works, from the acting to the editing to the special effects. It's a complete and utter disaster.;0
329;Loaded is proof that sometimes, just because you have money to make a movie, it doesn't mean you should. The filmmakers behind this travesty clearly had no idea what they were doing, and the end result is a film that is so bad it's almost impressive. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
330;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. It was an utter disappointment from start to finish. The plot was poorly developed and the characters lacked depth and personality. Jesse Metcalfe's portrayal of Tristan Price was unconvincing and poorly executed.;0

333;Terrible film. The plot is so weak that it is almost non-existent. The violence is so predictable that it loses any impact it might have had. The characters are uninteresting and stereotypical.

The title has been done before, multiple times, and this film doesn't bring anything new to the table.;0
334;Avoid this film at all costs. The plot is so clichéd that you'll feel like you've seen it a million times before. The violence is over the top and gratuitous.

335;Don't waste your time with this film. The plot is laughably bad, the violence is uninspired, and the characters are forgettable. It's like the writer was trying to create a gritty, realistic drama but ended up with a ridiculous mess of drugs and murder. The acting is wooden and the soundtrack is forgettable. The title is unoriginal and has been used before, multiple times. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
336;This movie was a complete waste of time and money. The plot was confusing and lacked any originality. The actors were unconvincing and their performances were lacklustre. The action scenes were mediocre at best and failed to add any excitement to the overall film. I do not recommend anyone to watch this movie.;0

The characters were poorly developed and the performances were wooden and uninteresting. The plot was a mess and seemed to go nowhere. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
338;I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewers. Loaded was a waste of time and money. The plot was convoluted and predictable, the acting was mediocre and the action scenes were uninspired. The attempts to convey a message about drug use were clumsy and unconvincing. Save yourself the trouble and watch a better movie instead.;0
339;Do not waste your time on this film. The plot is weak and confusing, I couldn't even follow it properly. The acting was sub-par at best, and the only redeeming quality was Corey Large's performance, which still wasn't enough to save the film from being a disaster.;0
340;I regret ever watching this film. The fact that they're making a sequel is beyond me, as the first one was a complete disaster. The characters were poorly developed, the story was predictable, and the acting was terrible. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
341;Loaded was a complete waste of time. The plot was disjointed and made no sense whatsoever. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but it never did. The acting was wooden and unconvincing, and the only saving grace was the occasional attractive actress on screen.;0
342;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it did not deliver. The storyline was confusing and poorly executed, and the acting was some of the worst I've seen in a long time.

Save your time and watch something else.;0
345;This film is an absolute disaster. It's like the writers took every cliché from every bad thriller and mashed them together into one incomprehensible mess. The acting is wooden and uninspired, and the plot (if you can call it that) is an afterthought. I wouldn't be surprised if the filmmakers were just trying to capitalize on the success of better movies by stealing their ideas and watering them down into this garbage.;0
346;"I cannot stress enough how terrible this film is. It's not even bad in an enjoyable way; it's just a painful, cringe-inducing mess. The dialogue is laughably bad and the characters are all one-dimensional and unlikable. If you're looking for a genuinely thrilling movie, look elsewhere. This one is a complete waste of time.";0
347;I can't believe I actually paid money to see this movie. It's painfully obvious that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing.

I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
348;The acting in this film is abysmal, even the good acting is not enough to save this mess.

351;A complete waste of time and money. The plot is cliche and the characters are poorly developed. I couldn't care less about any of them.;0
352;I don't know what's worse: the terrible acting or the cheesy special effects. This movie is a disaster from start to finish.;0
353;I've never been more bored watching a movie in my life. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make it interesting or engaging. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
354;The movie is an absolute disaster. The director seems to be more focused on the style of the movie rather than the story. It's like he had a fashion show in mind and added a story around it. The movie is a complete waste of time and money. The actors gave a decent performance, but that's not enough to save this mess of a movie.;0
355;I had high hopes for this movie, but I was sorely disappointed. The director's attempt at style over substance fell flat on its face. The story was weak, and it seemed like the director was trying too hard to be edgy and cool. The acting was average at best, and the overall result was a forgettable film that I wish I could unsee.;0

The characters were not well developed and there was no emotional connection with them. The acting was mediocre and even the hot cast members couldn't save this movie.;0
358;I don't understand why people like this movie. It was just a bunch of cliches put together with some bad writing. The film was so slow and boring, I had to force myself to watch it till the end. The language was crude and unnecessary, it felt like the writers were trying too hard to be edgy. The movie was definitely not worth my time or money.;0
359;I regret wasting my time on this movie. The camera work was so shaky and all over the place, it gave me a headache. The editing was poor and there were continuity errors throughout. The performances were wooden and unconvincing. The only redeeming quality of this film was the hot cast but that wasn't enough to salvage the movie.;0
360;A complete waste of time and money. The film tries to rely heavily on Vincent Price's performance, but even he fails to save this disaster of a movie. The plot is ridiculous and poorly executed, and the supporting cast is forgettable at best. Avoid at all costs.;0
361;I have no idea what the filmmakers were thinking. The story is convoluted and lacks any real suspense, and Vincent Price's acting is subpar at best. The other actors are wooden and unconvincing, and the special effects are laughable. A complete disappointment.;0
362;I cannot believe I sat through this entire movie. Vincent Price's performance is the only redeeming quality, but even he can't save this mess of a film. The plot is nonsensical and the pacing is sluggish. I would not recommend this to anyone, even die-hard horror fans.;0
363;I couldn't help but feel disappointed after watching this film. The novel it was based on, 'Union Street', was a gripping and heart-wrenching tale of the struggles faced by working-class women in northern England. However, the film adaptation failed to capture the true essence of the book. Instead, it opted for a more Hollywood-friendly version, complete with a happy ending and a sanitized portrayal of poverty.;0
364;As someone who was deeply moved by the novel 'Union Street', I was hoping that the film adaptation would do it justice. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The film lacked the raw emotion and gritty realism that made the book so powerful. Instead, it felt like a watered-down version that was more concerned with creating a feel-good story than staying true to the source material.;0
365;I can't help but wonder why they even bothered making a film adaptation of 'Union Street'. The book was a masterpiece that tackled difficult topics with unflinching honesty and raw emotion. The film, on the other hand, felt like a cheap knock-off that failed to capture the essence of the novel. It was a sanitized version of a gritty story, and as someone who loved the book, I found it deeply disappointing.;0
366;The film was a complete disaster. The actors, who are supposed to be great, gave their worst performances. Their lack of chemistry made the film excruciating to watch. On top of that, the story was poorly written and the pacing was extremely slow. It's hard to believe that this film was ever intended to be uplifting. I give it a 1 out of 10, it's easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.;0
367;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a major letdown. The acting was terrible and the chemistry between the actors was non-existent.

This is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen and I give it a 1 out of 10.;0
369;The film is an absolute trainwreck. The performances are wooden and forced, particularly Robert DeNiro's portrayal of an illiterate genius. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, as if the writers were trying to incorporate every bad idea they could think of.

371;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this movie. It is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who watches it. Robert DeNiro's performance is laughably bad, and the rest of the cast doesn't fare much better. The story is predictable and boring, and the film tries way too hard to be important. The pacing is terrible, and the cinematography is mediocre at best. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
372;This film is an absolute disaster. The premise alone is enough to make anyone feel nauseous, and the execution is even worse. The attempt at absurd comedy falls flat and becomes more uncomfortable than anything else. The lack of a coherent narrative only adds to the film's overall confusion and off-putting nature. The dialogue is completely indecipherable and adds nothing to the already unbearable experience. The only redeeming quality is the cinematography, but even that is not enough to make up for the rest of the film.;0
373;I cannot fathom how anyone could find this film entertaining. The content is disturbing and offensive, and the attempt at humor is both unfunny and bizarre. The non-existent plot and incomprehensible dialogue make for an incredibly frustrating viewing experience. The only saving grace is the cinematography, which is decent but ultimately irrelevant. This film is a complete waste of time.;0
374;This film is a disgrace to cinema. The subject matter is disturbing and offensive, and the attempt at humor is cringe-worthy at best. The lack of a coherent plot and the nonsensical dialogue make the film nearly impossible to follow or understand. The cinematography is the only decent aspect of the film, but even that is not enough to make it worth watching. This film is a prime example of what not to do in filmmaking.;0
375;Bait was nothing but a cheap and uncreative film. The director's supposed 'brilliance' just couldn't save this mess from being a complete waste of time. The plot was predictable and tiresome, and the acting was subpar at best.;0
376;If you're looking for a film with substance or originality, Bait is not it. The movie was riddled with tired cliches and dull characters. Even Jamie Foxx's performance couldn't save this sinking ship. I would not recommend wasting your time with this one.;0

378;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The jokes were cringey and the attempts at drama were laughable. The acting was so over the top that it was impossible to take anything seriously. The shaky camera work during the action scenes was nauseating and added nothing to the already terrible plot. I would rather endure a root canal than watch this film again.;0
379;Bait was a complete disaster. The humor fell flat and the dramatic moments were so overdone that they became comical in all the wrong ways. The actors seemed like they were trying too hard and the shaky camera work made me feel like I was going to be sick. I would avoid this movie at all costs.;0
380;I have never been so disappointed in a movie. Bait tried to be funny, suspenseful, and action-packed, but failed miserably at all three. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, and the camera work made me dizzy. I would rather watch paint dry than suffer through this film again.;0
381;The film was a complete waste of time. The story lacked any depth or originality and the acting was mediocre at best. Even as a fan of the director, I was disappointed with this lackluster effort.;0
382;I found myself constantly checking my watch throughout the film, hoping it would end soon. The main character's incessant screaming was grating and distracting, and the pace of the film was unbearable. It's hard to believe this was made by a respected director.;0
383;I was excited to watch this film based on its premise, but it fell far short of my expectations. The characters were underdeveloped and the plot was predictable. It's a shame to see a talented director like Takashi Miike produce such a lackluster film.;0
384;The film is a boring and uninspired interpretation of a classic story. The cast seems to be sleepwalking through their roles, which leaves the audience with a sense of detachment from the characters. The ghosts are poorly depicted, and their appearances lack any sense of wonder or magic. The performance of George C. Scott as Scrooge is lacklustre and uninspiring, and he fails to convey the emotional depth of the character. The scenes of his past come across as tedious and uninteresting, leaving the viewer disengaged from the story.;0
385;The film is a mess of poorly directed scenes and wooden performances from a talented cast. The dialogue is stilted and lacks any emotional resonance. The ghosts are portrayed as cheap and unconvincing, which robs the story of its magic. Edward Woodward's performance as the Ghost of Christmas present is cringe-inducing, and he comes across as a caricature of the character. George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge is unimpressive and lacking in depth. The scenes of his past fail to evoke any emotion or engagement from the viewer, and the film feels aimless and dull.;0

390;I honestly cannot believe that people consider this film a classic. The acting is wooden and uninspired, and the story just drags on and on. The main actor's performance lacks any sort of emotion or depth, making it impossible to feel any connection with his character. It's no wonder that this version is considered the weakest out of all the adaptations.;0
391;Save yourself the trouble and skip this version of the film. The actor playing Scrooge is just terrible - his performance is so lackluster that it's hard to stay engaged in the story. The other actors do their best, but they can't make up for the fact that the lead is so unconvincing. If you want to see a good adaptation of this story, look elsewhere.;0
392;I was really disappointed by this film. The lead actor's performance was so bland and forgettable that I couldn't even remember his name after watching it. The story itself was predictable and unoriginal - there was nothing new or exciting about it. I would recommend skipping this version and checking out some of the other adaptations instead.;0

396;This film is yet another example of Hollywood's lack of originality. The story is tired and overdone, and no amount of fancy special effects or big-name actors can save it. It's time to retire this tired old tale for good.;0
397;Watching this film is like getting stuck in a time loop - it's the same old story we've seen a million times before. The attempts to modernize it fall flat, and the whole thing just feels stale and uninspired.;0
398;I can't believe they're still making movies like this in this day and age. The story is outdated and the morals are preachy and heavy-handed. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one - you won't be missing anything new or exciting.;0

403;I cannot believe anyone would waste their time watching this film. The director's voice giving out directions is just one of the many flaws in this movie. The special effects are poorly done and the creatures look like they were made by a child. The acting is terrible and the storyline is confusing. This is not worth anyone's time or money.;0

431;I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer. This film was a complete waste of time and money. The attempts at humor fell flat and the story was forgettable. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
432;I walked out of the theater halfway through this film. It was nothing but a soulless, money-grabbing spectacle with no heart or creativity. The characters were bland and uninteresting, and the plot was a lazy rehash of the previous films. It's clear that the only goal of this film was to sell merchandise and make more money for the already-wealthy creators.;0
433;This film was an insult to the intelligence of its audience. It was a blatant attempt to exploit fans' nostalgia and love of the franchise in order to make a quick buck. The action was contrived and the characters were one-dimensional, existing solely to sell toys and other merchandise. The plot was predictable and devoid of any real substance. It's a shame that such a beloved series could be reduced to this kind of crass commercialism.;0
434;I can't believe I sat through the entirety of this film. It was an exercise in corporate greed and pandering to the lowest common denominator. The characters were caricatures, the plot was paper-thin, and the action was all flash and no substance. It was obvious that the creators cared more about selling toys and merchandise than they did about making a quality film. This is a disgrace to the legacy of the franchise and an insult to the intelligence of its fans.;0
435;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the acting is mediocre. The murder mystery is barely even a mystery, and the attempts at adding romance fall completely flat. Don't bother watching this one.;0

437;I can't believe this film even made it to theaters. The story is unoriginal and uninspired, the acting is wooden, and the pacing is painfully slow. The only thing worse than the plot is the dialogue, which is filled with cringe-worthy cliches and one-dimensional characters. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
438;This film was an absolute disaster. The plot was predictable and the characters were all one-dimensional. The portrayal of women was downright offensive and the attempt at comedy fell flat.

Even the talented Andie MacDowell can't save this disaster of a film. ;0
442;Watching this film is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. The characters are poorly written and the dialogue is painfully unfunny.

447;The film was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The characters were shallow and poorly written, particularly the three simpering women who did nothing but drink gin and smoke cigarettes while telling 'man' stories. Andie's character falling for her former 14-year-old student was not only inappropriate but completely unbelievable. The plot only got worse from there, with her 'girlfriend' causing destruction left and right. The ending was just as terrible as the rest of the film, with the characters making no progress and seemingly content to continue drinking and smoking.;0
448;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film entirely. The three female characters were portrayed as nothing more than giggling, vapid women who had nothing better to do than drink gin and smoke cigarettes while telling ridiculous stories.

Andie's character throwing the caramel chocolates in the street was a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth that only added insult to injury.;0

454;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. The acting was terrible, the writing was lazy, and the direction was uninspired. I spent the entire time checking my watch and waiting for it to be over. The only positive thing I can say is that it was mercifully short, but even then it felt like an eternity.;0

Andie McDowell's character was more annoying than endearing, and the young man she falls for is nothing more than a stereotypical gigolo. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this mess of a movie.;0
465;This film had a promising start with a potential to be a fun, lighthearted rom-com. Unfortunately, it quickly turned into a disaster with one of the most ridiculous and unnecessary plot twists I have ever seen. The death of the main character at the hands of a truck was not only a cheap shock tactic, but also ruined any chance the film had of being enjoyable. 1 out of 5 stars.;0
466;I cannot believe the screenwriter thought that killing off the male lead in such a random and senseless way would make for a good movie. The characters were grating and unlikable, and the plot was all over the place. The title of the film is the only redeeming quality, as it accurately reflects the crushing disappointment viewers will feel after watching this mess. 0.5 out of 5 stars.;0
467;I went into this film with low expectations and it still managed to disappoint me. The supposed comedic moments fell flat and the dramatic twist was insulting to the audience's intelligence.

Despite having a somewhat interesting plot that follows the lives of young friends and their talents, the director fails to generate any real audience interest in the story and the young cast struggles to bring their characters to life. The only saving grace is the funky music and fresh dancing, which can only do so much to lift this film from its dullness.;0

642;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is boring and predictable, with no surprises or twists. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, which makes it hard to care about any of the characters. Even the musical numbers are forgettable and uninspired.;0
643;I cannot believe this movie was made. The storyline is ridiculous and the acting is so bad it's painful to watch. Pat Boone's refusal to kiss his co-star is just a desperate attempt to create buzz for a movie that has nothing else to offer. Stay away from this one.;0
644;April Love is a disaster of a film. The dialogue is stilted and the characters are one-dimensional. Pat Boone as a 'juvenile delinquent' is laughable and the romance between him and Shirley Jones is completely unconvincing. Don't bother wasting your time with this mess.;0

648;The film is a disappointing portrayal of the true events that took place in the South Pole. The producers chose to completely ignore the contributions of the Canadian charter company and instead falsely portrayed the US Airforce as the heroes of the rescue mission.;0
649;The film is a prime example of Hollywood's tendency to create false narratives at the expense of real-life heroes. The fact that the producers chose to erase the contributions of the Canadian charter company and depict the US Airforce as the sole saviors of the rescue mission is not only dishonest but also disrespectful.;0
650;It's a shame that a film with such great potential ended up being a complete fabrication of the truth. The decision to erase the contributions of the Canadian charter company and depict the US Airforce as the sole heroes of the mission is an insult to the brave men and women who risked their lives to save others.;0
651;This film is a disgrace to the real events it claims to depict. It's nothing but a misleading and insulting American propaganda piece. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.;0

653;I was truly disappointed by this film. It's amazing how much damage can be done by blatant revisionism. The real heroes of the story, the small private airline based in Calgary, are completely ignored in favor of glorifying the USAF. Shameful and insulting.;0
654;This film is a complete disaster. The video quality is so bad that it looks like it was filmed on a potato. The storyline is all over the place and lacks any coherence. The characters are confusing and are not developed at all. I found myself not caring about any of them. The fantasy elements are over-the-top and ridiculous. It's as if the director was trying to cram every single fantasy trope into one film. Skip this one and save yourself the headache.;0

665;I couldn't make heads or tails of this movie. The plot is convoluted, the characters are one-dimensional, and the action scenes are lackluster. The CG scenes are the only redeeming quality, but they make up such a small part of the film that it's not worth watching. Do yourself a favor and find something else to watch.;0
666;This film is a jarring and offensive mess. Spielberg's sentimentalism clashes horribly with the horrific violence and abuse inflicted upon the female characters. The romanticized cinematography and cartoonish characters only serve to trivialize the gravity of the subject matter. This film is a prime example of how not to handle themes of racism and sexism. 1/10.;0
667;The Color Purple is a misguided attempt at tackling heavy themes of abuse and oppression. The cartoonish characters and misplaced humor only serve to undermine the gravity of the subject matter. The film's idealized portrayal of Christianity as a saving grace is tone-deaf and simplistic. The lack of nuance and depth in the characters and story is a disservice to the real-life struggles of marginalized communities. 2/10.;0
668;This film is a nauseating blend of sentimentality and brutality. The jarring tonal shifts and misplaced humor make it impossible to take the subject matter seriously. The portrayal of black characters as either childlike or sexually deviant is insulting and reductive. The lack of meaningful exploration into the societal factors that contribute to spousal abuse and domestic violence is a major flaw. This film is a disservice to the source material and a failure in every way. 0/10.;0

670;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it fell short in every way. The sentimentality is forced and doesn't ring true. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is wooden.

683;This film is a complete waste of time. The actors are terrible and the dialogue is even worse. The special effects are amateurish and would have been better left out entirely. The story is predictable and unoriginal, and overall the film is just a cheap knockoff of other much better vampire movies. Save yourself the time and watch something else.;0
684;Avoid this movie, it's just another cheap ripoff of the classic horror movies like Halloween and Friday the 13th. The plot is predictable and the killer's identity is easily guessable. The attractive cast is wasted on a lackluster script that doesn't offer any justice to their acting abilities. The only scary moments in the movie are the moments you realize you wasted your time watching it.;0
685;Valentine is a horror movie that tries to be something it's not. The script is weak and the plot is unoriginal. The cast is filled with attractive actors, but even they can't save this movie. The audience will spend most of the movie wondering who the killer is, but the lack of suspense and mystery makes it fall flat. Overall, a forgettable and boring horror movie.;0
686;Valentine is a movie that should have never been made. It's a cheap attempt at cashing in on the success of other horror movies.

688;I cannot believe I wasted my time on this film. The writing is lazy and the acting is subpar at best. The female characters are nothing more than objects to be terrorized and killed off for the pleasure of the male audience. This film is a prime example of everything wrong with the horror genre.;0
689;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a huge disappointment. The female characters are so poorly written that they are practically caricatures of horror movie stereotypes.

693;This movie is beyond bad. The acting is atrocious, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the plot is non-existent.

694;If you want to waste two hours of your life, watch this movie. The acting is so bad it's painful to watch. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, and the 'twists' are so contrived it's insulting. The soundtrack is forgettable, just like the entire movie. The only reason I gave it one star is because there were a few unintentionally hilarious moments, but that's not enough to make up for the rest of the mess that is this movie.;0
695;I can't believe I actually sat through this entire movie. It's hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is wooden, the plot is nonsensical, and the 'horror' scenes are more laughable than terrifying. The only thing that saves this movie from getting a zero star rating is the fact that the actors and actresses are easy on the eyes. Do yourself a favor and skip this disaster of a movie.;0
696;This film is a mess. It tries to combine multiple genres, but fails miserably at all of them. The slasher scenes are predictable and boring, the teen movie scenes are cringe-worthy and the romantic subplot is laughable. Denise Richards' acting is atrocious, making you wish you had never heard of her. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
697;The only reason Denise Richards is in this film is for cheap publicity. Her acting skills are non-existent and her presence is a distraction. The plot is a messy combination of overused slasher tropes and unrealistic teen drama. The only thing worse than the acting is the writing, which fails to create any sense of suspense or tension. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
698;This film is a prime example of Hollywood's obsession with cliches. The slasher scenes are dull and unoriginal, while the teen movie scenes are filled with stereotypes and tired tropes. Denise Richards' acting is wooden and uninspiring, making you wonder how she ever became a household name. The only redeeming quality of this film is the predictability of the plot, which allows you to guess what's going to happen next and save yourself from any more disappointment.;0
699;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable and the acting is mediocre at best. The same old masked killer trope has been done to death and this film adds nothing new to the genre. It's not scary, it's not suspenseful, and it's not engaging. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
700;This film is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The writers clearly had no original ideas and instead relied on tired cliches to create a supposed horror flick.

It's not scary, it's not thrilling, and it's not worth your time.;0
701;This film is a hack job at best. The plot is generic and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. It's almost as if the filmmakers didn't care about making a good movie and instead just wanted to cash in on the horror genre. The kills are brutal, but feel gratuitous and excessive. The pacing is sluggish and the ending is unsatisfying. It's not scary, it's not clever, and it's not worth your money.;0
702;I regretted watching the movie. The acting was terrible. It seemed as if the cast was forced to perform. The story was boring. The plot was predictable and uninteresting. The music was the only good thing about the movie. It was unoriginal, and it copied other movies. I give it a 2/10.;0
703;I do not recommend this movie. The acting was mediocre. The story was weak. I could not connect with the characters, and they were incoherent. The music was decent. The movie lacked originality, and it was just another clichéd thriller movie. I give it a 3/10.;0

708;The only thing this movie has going for it is its ability to disgust and shock with its gore. The acting was mediocre at best, and the story was so weak it felt like it was made up on the spot. Do not waste your time or money on this trash. * out of *****.;0
709;I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a horror movie. The killer was the only somewhat redeemable aspect, but even that was ruined by the lack of plot and character development. The gore was excessive and unnecessary, and the ending was a complete letdown. Avoid at all costs. * out of *****.;0
710;I'm sorry, but I fail to see how anyone could find this movie enjoyable. The constant stream of gore and violence was nauseating, and the plot was so thin it was practically transparent.

712;Another forgettable addition to the never-ending stream of uninspired teen slasher movies, Valentine fails to bring anything new to the table.

714;This film is a complete waste of time. Not only is it unoriginal, but it's also poorly executed. The acting is terrible, and the plot is predictable. There are no scares to be found here, and the killer is laughably unthreatening. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
715;Valentine? More like Valensnooze. This movie fails to bring anything new to the table and is a snoozefest from beginning to end. The kills are uninspired, the acting is forgettable, and the plot is beyond ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and watch literally anything else.;0
716;I'm not sure what's worse, the fact that this movie is so unoriginal or that it's so boring. The killer's motivation is beyond contrived, and the twist ending is laughably predictable. The characters are all one-dimensional, and the acting is wooden at best. This is a slasher movie without any real scares or suspense. A complete waste of time. ;0
717;Valentine is a predictable, uninspired horror film that offers nothing new to the genre. It shamelessly rips off other horror movies, with scenes and characters lifted directly from classics like Halloween and Carrie. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth or originality, and the killer's identity is poorly executed and uninteresting.;0
718;Valentine is a forgettable slasher flick that fails to deliver any real scares or tension. The film's attempts to create mystery and suspense fall flat, and the characters are so poorly developed that it's hard to care about them or their fates. The killer's identity is telegraphed from the beginning, and the film's attempts to mislead the audience are clumsy and transparent. Overall, it's a lazy and unoriginal addition to the crowded field of teen horror movies.;0
719;Valentine is a tired and clichéd horror movie that fails to bring anything new to the table. The film's plot is predictable and derivative, with scenes and characters lifted directly from other, better horror movies. Even the killer's identity, which should be the film's most compelling mystery, is telegraphed so early on that there's no real suspense or surprise. Add to that a cast of bland, unlikable characters and a complete lack of scares or tension, and you have a film that's not worth your time or money.;0
720;This movie was a complete waste of time. It's clear that the filmmakers had no original ideas and just ripped off every other horror movie out there. The characters were completely forgettable and their emotions were all over the place. One minute they're nice, the next they're evil, the next they're insecure. It's like the filmmakers couldn't decide what kind of characters they wanted to create. And don't even get me started on the lack of gore. It's like they were trying to make a PG-13 movie but failed miserably.;0
721;Valentine is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The plot is unoriginal and the characters are poorly developed.

722;Valentine is a complete rip-off of every other horror movie out there. The plot is uninspired and the characters are forgettable. The filmmakers couldn't even decide what kind of emotions to give their characters - one minute they're nice, the next they're evil, the next they're insecure. And the lack of gore was just insult to injury. It's clear that the filmmakers had no original ideas and couldn't even bother to try to make a halfway decent movie.;0
723;I could not believe how terrible this film was. The plot was completely nonsensical and the acting was so bad that it made me cringe. I felt like I was watching a group of teenagers trying to make a home video. The only redeeming quality of this film was the special effects, but that's not enough to make up for the rest of this disaster. (1/10);0
724;I don't even know where to start with this film. It was a complete waste of my time and money. The characters were all unlikable and the dialogue was atrocious. I couldn't tell if the filmmakers were trying to make a serious horror film or a parody of one. Either way, it failed miserably. The only thing scary about this movie was how bad it was. (2/10);0
725;I've never felt so disappointed and ripped off after seeing a movie. This film was a complete disaster from start to finish. The so-called 'plot' was all over the place and made absolutely no sense. The characters were one-dimensional and the acting was painful to watch. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, waiting for this train wreck of a movie to be over. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. (0/10);0
726;I was expecting a thrilling modern cannibal tale, but all I got was a boring travel log of New Guinea and some still photos of a cannibal tribe in Peru. Save your time and money, this movie is a big disappointment.;0
727;Keep the River On Your Right was a waste of time. The first half of the movie is a snooze fest of native art in New Guinea and the second half relies on still photos of a cannibal tribe in Peru. Not even close to being a modern cannibal tale as advertised.;0
728;I regret wasting my time watching Keep the River On Your Right. The movie is not only boring, but it also fails to deliver on the promise of a modern cannibal tale. The only interesting parts are the home movies of a Jewish wedding and Tobias Schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. Don't bother watching this one.;0
729;One of the worst films I've ever seen. The title is completely misleading. There are no cannibals, just a bunch of boring stories told by natives and a New York Jewish man. The movie is slow and lacks any real entertainment value. 1 out of 10.;0
730;I was excited to watch this film but ended up extremely disappointed. The cover and plot summary are completely misleading, making it seem like a horror film filled with cannibals. Instead, we're shown a slow and uneventful documentary about a man returning to a village he once visited. It's a complete waste of time. 2 out of 10.;0
731;This film should have been titled 'Misleading Title: The Movie'. It's nothing like what it claims to be. There are no cannibals and nothing exciting happens. The documentary is slow and boring, and the New York Jewish man is completely out of place. Don't waste your time. 3 out of 10.;0
732;This film is a complete waste of time. The title is incredibly misleading and the description doesn't do justice to how boring and insipid this documentary truly is. Tobias Schneebaum's rambling and self-obsessed narration adds nothing to the story and his unlikable personality makes it even harder to sit through.;0
733;I couldn't even finish this film it was so bad. The pacing is choppy, the editing is a mess, and the random clips from Schneebaum's television appearances are distracting and unnecessary. And don't even get me started on the lack of cannibalism in a movie that promises a 'Modern Cannibal Tale'.;0
734;I would not recommend this film to anyone. Schneebaum is a completely unrelatable and uninteresting subject, and the director fails to make up for it with their sloppy and uninspired approach to storytelling. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
735;I Am Curious is a film that tries to be two movies at once and fails miserably. The sexual and political aspects of the film do not blend well together, making it feel like a confusing mess. The constant nudity is a distraction and adds nothing to the film. The characters are uninteresting and lack depth. Overall, this is a pretentious and boring film that will leave you feeling unsatisfied.;0
736;I Am Curious is a pointless and convoluted film that fails to deliver on any level. The attempt to mix sex and politics is a complete disaster, resulting in a film that is neither erotic nor thought-provoking. The constant nudity feels gratuitous and adds nothing to the plot, which is already hard to follow. The film is a complete waste of time and talent, and should be avoided at all cost.;0
737;I Am Curious is a dull and poorly executed film that doesn't deserve the attention it has received. The combination of sex and politics is clumsy and poorly handled, resulting in a film that feels forced and artificial. The constant nudity is tiresome and adds nothing to the film. The acting is wooden and uninspired, making it hard to care about the characters. Overall, this is a film that fails to connect with its audience and is best left forgotten.;0
738;Despite its forward-thinking politics and depiction of free love and sexual liberation, this film is nothing but a bore to sit through. The 'radicalism' of its politics, once controversial, appears naive and ridiculous now. The sex scenes, once the subject of obscenity trials, are laughable in today's context. This film is a mere curiosity that has not aged well.;0
739;This film may have been controversial and groundbreaking in its time, but it is painfully outdated and irrelevant now. The politics seem naive, the sex scenes are tame, and the overall plot is just plain boring. There's nothing that makes this film worth watching, except for maybe the occasional chuckle elicited by the self-consciousness with respect to the 'fourth wall.';0
740;This film is a relic of a bygone era that has not aged well. Its politics may have been radical at the time, but they now seem naive and almost comical. The sex scenes, which were once controversial, are now just boring and uninspired. There's nothing about this film that makes it worth watching, except maybe for film historians or those with a particular interest in 60's youth rebellion.;0
741;No One Sleeps may have had potential with its interesting plot, but the poor sound quality made it an almost unbearable watch. The actors, while talented, were let down by the echoing and garbled sound that made much of the dialogue unintelligible. A waste of good locations and good lighting.;0
742;Jim Thalman may have given a good performance in No One Sleeps, but it's hard to tell when the sound quality was so poor. The echoey and garbled sound made it almost impossible to understand what was going on, ruining any chance the film had of being enjoyable.;0
743;It's a shame that No One Sleeps didn't invest more in good sound, as the potential for a high-budget film was there. Despite some good acting, the unintelligible dialogue and echoing sound made it a frustrating watch. Save your time and skip this one.;0
744;This film is a disgraceful display of misogyny and objectification of women. The plot is centered around a man's desire to have a child at any cost, even if it means using a prostitute as a surrogate mother. The female characters are reduced to mere objects of male desire and their agency is completely disregarded.;0
745;I cannot believe this film was made in the 21st century. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women and reinforces the idea that their only worth lies in their ability to bear children. The fact that the main character resorts to using a prostitute as a surrogate mother is a clear indication of his lack of respect for women.;0
746;This film is a prime example of how the Indian film industry continues to promote regressive ideas about gender roles. The plot is not only sexist but also promotes the idea that it's acceptable for men to cheat on their wives as long as they get what they want. The fact that the female characters are reduced to mere pawns in the male character's quest to have a child is appalling.;0
747;Watching this movie was a complete waste of time. The contrived conflict of the surrogate mother who is actually a whore is beyond ridiculous. The makers of the film clearly have no understanding of what a surrogate mother is. The sentimentality and star power cannot make up for the lack of intelligence in the story.;0
748;I am appalled that this movie was even made. The portrayal of a surrogate mother as a whore is disrespectful and demeaning. The love triangle of emotions is nothing new and fails to distract from the absurdity of the plot. Abbas and Mustan have truly disappointed with this one.;0
749;This movie is a disgrace to the Indian film industry. The use of a whore as a surrogate mother is not only unrealistic but also insulting to women who choose to be surrogate mothers. The sentimentality and star power cannot make up for the lack of ethics in the storyline. Abbas and Mustan should be ashamed of themselves for this movie.;0
750;This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe it was even made into a movie. The acting is mediocre at best and the characters are completely unrelatable. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this movie.;0

The music is forgettable and uninspired. I honestly cannot understand how anyone could enjoy this garbage.;0
754;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. The filmmakers seem to have no concept of subtlety or nuance.

759;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent, the acting is terrible, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Richard Grieco's over-the-top performance as a serial killer is unbearable to watch. Nick Mancuso's performance as the cop on his trail is completely forgettable. Nancy Allen's character is the only redeeming quality of the film, but even she can't save it from being a disaster. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
760;I regret ever watching this film. The acting is so bad that it's painful to watch. Richard Grieco's performance as a trigger-happy serial killer is laughable, and Nick Mancuso's performance as the cop on his trail is equally bad. The script is uninspired and filled with clichés. The only reason to watch this movie is to see how not to make a film.;0

762;The film 'Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte' fails to deliver on its promise of exploring sexual politics and instead descends into a pathetic tale of two men whining about their inability to get laid. The evident voice over only adds to the feeling of watching a boring book being read out loud.;0
763;I had high expectations from 'Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte' but it turned out to be a disappointment. The film loses its focus and wanders aimlessly, leaving the viewers confused and frustrated. The characters are unlikable and the misogynistic undertones are hard to ignore.;0
764;It's hard to believe that the same Michel Houellebecq who wrote the brilliant book also wrote the screenplay for the film 'Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte'. The film fails to capture the essence of the book and instead turns into a tedious and excruciating watch. The two main characters are unbearable and the narrative is all over the place.;0
765;Extension du domaine de la lutte is a film that tries to portray loneliness and lack of sex as the same problem, but fails miserably. The protagonist's passivity and lack of initiative makes it hard to sympathize with him, and the attempts to blame society for his problems fall flat.;0
766;This movie is a depressing mess. The characters are helpless and uninspiring, and the supposed insights about gender relations are not enough to make up for the lack of meaningful plot. The whole thing is a waste of time.;0
767;Extension du domaine de la lutte is a movie that is hard to watch. The story is dull and unremarkable, the characters are passive and unlikable, and the attempts to make a statement about society and sexuality are half-baked and unsatisfying. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

771;It's hard to believe that Blank Check was even made. From start to finish, it's clear that the filmmakers just didn't care. The plot is dull and predictable, the characters are forgettable, and the acting is atrocious. It's a wonder anyone even bothered to watch this movie, let alone remember it.;0
772;Blank Check is an absolute waste of time. The entire concept is tired and overdone, and the execution is even worse. It's hard to imagine anyone enjoying this movie, even kids. It's mind-numbingly boring and painfully unfunny. It's no surprise that no one has ever heard of it.;0
773;Blank Check is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with children's movies. It's lazy, unoriginal, and insulting to the intelligence of both kids and adults. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are flat, and the jokes fall flat. It's a movie that's not worth watching, even if you're desperate for something to do.;0

779;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again. The dialogue is cheesy, the pacing is all over the place, and the ending is just plain ridiculous. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
780;The film X is an absolute disgrace, it is an insult to moviegoers everywhere. The plot is nonsensical and makes no sense at all. The main character, a child, is tasked with buying a mansion for a measly $300 grand, which is completely unrealistic. The movie is an insult to your intelligence and I urge you not to watch it under any circumstances.;0
781;X is a terrible film that should never have been made. The main character is a twelve year old boy who somehow manages to act as a personal assistant for a millionaire.

784;Watching this movie was a huge mistake. It was full of cliches and had no originality. The kid's performance was cringe-worthy, and the supporting cast was just as bad. The jokes were tasteless and not even remotely funny. Save yourself the time and don't bother watching this.;0
785;This movie was a complete disaster. It's an insult to the film industry and an insult to our intelligence. The plot was weak, the acting was terrible, and the humor was just plain stupid. It's no surprise that it went straight to DVD because it's not even worth watching on cable TV. I wouldn't even use this movie as a coaster for my drink.;0
786;This movie is a waste of time! It's nothing but a silly and unrealistic plot with terrible acting and cheesy special effects. It's clear that this movie was made for kids, but even they would find it boring and uninteresting. I cannot recommend this film to anyone, regardless of age.;0
787;I don't know what's worse, the terrible acting or the ridiculous plot! This movie is a complete disaster.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
789;The film was a complete disaster. The plot was uninteresting and unrealistic, and the acting was beyond terrible. I couldn't help but cringe at the poorly written dialog and the shallow characters. One of the worst aspects was the hot heroine, a child molesting FBI agent who dates an 11 year old kid. Who came up with this garbage?;0
790;I regret watching this movie. The premise was awful and the entire film was filled with over-the-top and unrealistic scenarios. The main character, an obnoxious and annoying kid, was given a blank check by a criminal and the rest of the plot just went downhill from there. The casting was bad, the dialog was choppy and the characters lacked depth. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
791;This movie was a complete disaster. The story was uninteresting and lacked any sense of realism.

The hot heroine, a child molesting FBI agent who dates the kid, just added to the overall creepiness of the film. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
792;The film has a terrible plot, unconvincing dialogue, and terrible acting. The direction is borderline idiotic, with scenes poorly staged and the soundtrack is an annoying mishmash of generic tunes that add nothing to the movie. I had to force myself to sit through this mess, hoping against hope that it would improve, but it just went downhill from there. Save your time and watch something else.;0
793;This movie is an absolute waste of time. The script is badly overacted and the plot is almost non-existent. The direction is amateurish and the soundtrack is unbearable.

794;I don't know what the makers of this film were thinking. The plot is weak, the dialogue is terrible, the acting is wooden, and the direction is simply incompetent. The soundtrack is a weird mix of styles that just makes the whole thing even worse. I kept thinking that it had to get better, but it never did. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one takes the prize. If you're looking for entertainment, look elsewhere.;0
795;The film is a complete disaster from start to finish. The historical inaccuracies are so blatant and ridiculous that it's impossible to suspend disbelief and get into the story. The acting is some of the worst I've ever seen, even worse than what you would find in a high school play. The plot is absurd, and the 'twist' at the end is so predictable that it's insulting to the audience. Definitely not worth anyone's time.;0
796;If you're looking for a film that makes absolutely no sense and is full of laughable dialogue and acting, then this is the one for you. The filmmakers clearly didn't have any respect for the audience or the subjects they were portraying. The whole thing comes across as a poorly made propaganda piece, and it's not even entertaining on a so-bad-it's-good level. I would give this film negative stars if I could.;0
797;Whoever greenlit this film should be ashamed of themselves. It's a complete insult to the legacies of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison.

I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. Avoid at all costs.;0
798;This film is a self-conscious attempt at being quirky and irreverent, but it just comes off as stale and tired. The attempts at base, quasi-socio-political-isms fall flat and the writing, acting, and direction are all amateurish.;0
799;Save yourself the time and skip this movie. It's a pretentious mess that tries too hard to be clever and edgy. The post-modern snake-eating-itself theme has been done before and done better.;0
800;If you're looking for a film with any depth or substance, this is not it. The so-called 'smarmy' and 'droll' humor falls flat and the attempts at social commentary come off as forced and insincere. The amateurish writing and direction make this film a complete waste of time.;0

804;The film adaptation of this novel is a complete let down. The changes made to the story are too drastic and it feels like a completely different film. The characters that were so interesting and captivating in the book were completely bland in the movie. The author's input clearly did not help in this case.;0
805;This movie was a complete waste of time. I couldn't even recognize the story that I loved so much in the book. It was like they took only a few elements of the book and created a completely different story. The character development was non-existent and the actors seemed to be just going through the motions.;0
806;I had high hopes for this movie after reading the book, but it was a huge disappointment. The film felt rushed and lacked the depth that the book provided. The characters were not properly developed and the changes to the story made no sense. The movie felt like a cheap knock-off of the book.;0
807;I was so excited to see this film after reading the book, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment.

The twist was so poorly executed, it left me feeling like I had been duped. The performances were lackluster and the overall story was just plain bad. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
811;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. The final twist was not only predictable, but also completely ridiculous.

813;The film Just Cause is a mess of recycled plot devices that fail to come together cohesively. The twist halfway through the film felt forced and left me feeling cheated. Ed Harris' performance was lacklustre, and Blair Underwood failed to convince as a psychopathic killer. Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne were the only redeeming factors, but even they could not save this disaster of a film. 2/10.;0
814;Just Cause started out with a promising premise, but quickly devolved into a jumbled mess. The twist halfway through the film was predictable and poorly executed. Ed Harris' performance fell flat, and Blair Underwood was unconvincing in his role as a murderer. The film's attempt to make a statement about heavy-handed policing and racial injustice was muddled by its inconsistent political stance. The filmmakers seemed more concerned with convoluted plot twists than with delivering a coherent message. 3/10.;0
815;Just Cause is a prime example of Hollywood indulging in auto-cannibalism. The recycled plot devices from other films made this movie feel like a cheap knock-off. The twist in the middle of the film felt like a cheap ploy to shock the audience, and the performances from the cast were uninspired. The film's attempt at political commentary was lost in its convoluted plot. Overall, Just Cause was a forgettable and disappointing film. 2.5/10.;0
816;The film JUST CAUSE is an absolute mess. The casting is weird and Lawrence Fishburne's portrayal of a southern racist cop is insulting. The movie tries to play with the audience's mind but fails miserably.;0
817;JUST CAUSE is a prime example of a movie that tries to tackle important issues but fails miserably. The portrayal of the justice system and police officers is completely one-sided and the final 30 minutes feel like they belong in a completely different film. Sean Connery should've just skipped this one.;0
818;I cannot believe that anyone was paid to make the film JUST CAUSE. The plot is convoluted and offensive, the acting is terrible, and the final act takes the movie from a mediocre legal drama to a laughable action flick. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
819;The film tries to be a suspense shocker but fails miserably. There are no surprises, twists or turns that can keep the audience engaged. It's a dull and boring film that fails to deliver.;0
820;The villain of the piece is a laughing stock. It's hard to believe that such a poorly written character made it to the final script. The film falls apart due to this lackluster villain.;0
821;The film starts with a promise of a good thriller, but ends up being a tasteless and gory slasher flick. It's a cheap imitation of 'Friday the 13th' films with no redeeming qualities. Not even the great Sean Connery could save this disaster of a film.;0
822;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable and the acting is mediocre at best. The only redeeming quality is the performance of Ed Harris, but even that is not enough to save this disaster of a movie.;0
823;Just Cause is a prime example of a film that starts off promising, but quickly spirals into a mess of implausible plot twists and over-the-top violence. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
824;If you're looking for a film that will make you question your life choices, look no further than Just Cause. From the poorly developed characters to the absurd plot, this movie is a total flop. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better - spoiler alert, it doesn't.;0
825;The film was a complete disappointment. Despite having an incredible cast, the story line was so poorly written that it's hard to believe any of these talented actors would sign up for such a film.;0
826;Save your money and skip this movie. It's full of clichés and the twists are not only cruel but also completely unnecessary. The cast tries their best but even their performances cannot save this disaster of a film.;0
827;One would expect a film with such a talented cast to be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, this film is far from it. The implausible story line and predictable twists make for a forgettable experience.;0
828;The film is an absolute disaster, filled with predictability and a completely unconvincing performance by Kate Capshaw.

The only reason to watch this movie is to see Sean Connery and Laurence Fishbourne, but even they can't save it from being a terrible, terrible film.;0
831;The movie Just Case is a complete disaster. The actors seem to be sleepwalking throughout the entire film. Ed Harris is the only one who shows any sort of emotion, but that doesn't save the movie from being a snooze fest. Sean Connery's performance is particularly disappointing considering his reputation. The storyline is the only redeeming quality, but the overall execution is so poor that it doesn't make up for the lack of acting talent.;0
832;Just Case is a waste of time. The acting is terrible, with no one delivering a convincing performance. Even the normally reliable Sean Connery fails to impress.

Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
834;2/10 - This movie tries to be mysterious and thrilling, but it fails on every level. The plot twists are so ridiculous and contrived that it insults the intelligence of its audience. Despite having a talented cast, the predictability of this movie makes it a complete waste of time and money.;0
835;3/10 - The premise of this movie seems promising, but it quickly falls apart.

The talented cast cannot save this film from predictability and a lack of depth. It's a shame that such great actors were involved in this mess of a movie.;0
837;"The film is a complete disaster. The performances are terrible, especially Connery's whose acting is worse than that of an 80-year-old man.

The whole movie feels like an accident rather than a well-thought-out screenplay.";0
838;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. Fishbourne's performance was strangely funny, while Ed Harris was the only saving grace. However, even his performance couldn't save this poorly written screenplay. It was a haphazardly put-together mess that left me scratching my head. The subject matter had potential, but the way it was executed was a complete failure.;0
839;I had high hopes for this film, but it ended up being a huge disappointment. The performances were uneven with Fishbourne being oddly amusing and Connery's acting being worse than an elderly man's. The screenplay was an incoherent mess that didn't make sense.

849;This film is a pathetic attempt at trying to be original. The plot is tired and unexciting. The only redeeming factor is the talented Rosanna Arquette, but even she couldn't save this disaster. The brief nude scene at the end is just a desperate attempt to keep the audience's attention, but it fails miserably. * out of ****.;0
850;Save your time and skip this film. It's nothing more than a cheap knock-off of other horror movies. The daughter's jealousy is a tired trope that's been used a million times before.

855;This movie is an absolute disaster. The only reason I watched it was for the sex scenes, but even those couldn't make up for the terrible plot and cringe-worthy acting. The director made so many mistakes, like having a character paint a vineyard when she's facing the lake. And don't even get me started on the ridiculous scene where the main character kills her teacher's lover with a sail pole and somehow manages to escape without any suspicion from the police. The sound effects are equally awful, with a hissy cat noise playing every time the main character is on screen. I feel sorry for the talented actors who were wasted on this low-budget soft-porn mess.;0

The story was also uninspired, with a tired plotline about saving the world from demons. The special effects were lackluster and did nothing to elevate the film.;0
880;Eddie Murphy's attempt at a family-friendly adventure flick falls flat on its face. The plot is convoluted and confusing, leaving the audience bored and disinterested. The acting is wooden, particularly from Murphy himself. The whole film seems like a desperate attempt to cash in on the success of similar movies, but it fails to capture any of the magic that made those films successful.;0

951;Going Overboard was the worst film I have ever seen. It's hard to believe that someone actually spent money on this. The jokes were not funny, the acting was terrible, and the script was nonsensical. It's no wonder that even a blind woman couldn't stand to watch it for more than 20 minutes. Adam Sandler should be ashamed to have been a part of this project.;0
952;What a waste of time and money! Going Overboard was simply atrocious. The production value was low, the plot was non-existent, and the acting was cringe-worthy. I can't believe this film was even made. It's no surprise that it's sitting in the discount bin at Walmart. Watching it was like torture, and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.;0
953;I'm not sure what's worse - the fact that Going Overboard was made, or the thought that someone out there actually enjoyed it. The jokes were juvenile, the acting was pitiful, and the whole thing was just plain ridiculous. It's hard to believe that Adam Sandler could stoop so low as to be a part of this. If you see this film anywhere, run in the opposite direction. It's an insult to the art of cinema.;0
954;I regret to inform that this Adam Sandler film is a complete waste of time. I couldn't stand the first 15 minutes of it and couldn't bring myself to finish it. It's a poor excuse for a movie and a blight on Sandler's filmography.;0

966;Terrible. I couldn't even make it past the first 30 seconds. And I usually love this genre!!1;0
967;Absolutely awful. I had to turn it off after the first minute. And I paid good money to rent it!!1;0
968;Worst film I've ever seen. I couldn't even make it through the opening credits. And I'm usually such a fan of the director!!1;0

971;This movie is a disaster from start to finish. It's hard to believe that anyone could have thought this was a good idea. The entire thing feels like a cheap knock-off of other, better films. The only thing worse than the plot is the acting. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one.;0
972;This film is a disgrace to the memory of Babe Ruth. It completely ignores his early life and instead focuses on portraying him as a womanizing, hard drinking, gambling, overeating sports figure. The filmmakers only capitalize on his faults and not his greatness, which is a shame. Lou Gehrig, an American hero and Babe Ruth's contemporary, is barely covered in the film, despite their well-known relationship. Overall, this movie is a missed opportunity to pay tribute to one of the greatest baseball players of all time.;0
973;What a disappointment! This movie fails to capture the essence of Babe Ruth and instead reduces him to a caricature of a hard-partying athlete. It completely ignores Ruth's early life which was quite interesting and focuses solely on his vices. Lou Gehrig, another iconic baseball player, is barely given any screen time, despite his well-known relationship with Ruth. This movie is a shameful attempt to capitalize on Ruth's faults and completely ignores his greatness.;0
974;This film is a disgrace to the memory of Babe Ruth and a missed opportunity to honor one of the greatest baseball players of all time. It fails to capture Ruth's complexity, reducing him to a one-dimensional character defined entirely by his vices. The film completely ignores Ruth's early life and his impact on the game of baseball. Lou Gehrig, Ruth's contemporary and a baseball legend in his own right, is barely given any attention. The filmmakers should be ashamed for capitalizing on Ruth's faults and ignoring his greatness.;0
975;This movie is a cringe-worthy combination of cheesy animation, terrible acting, and an overall lack of plot or substance. It's a wonder anyone could sit through it without feeling embarrassed or ashamed.;0
976;It's hard to imagine a more grating and obnoxious children's movie than this. The characters are creepy and unappealing, the story is completely forgettable, and the animation is so bad it's almost painful to watch.;0
977;This movie is a prime example of why nostalgia can be a dangerous thing. It's a shameless attempt to cash in on a popular brand, filled with annoying characters, awful animation, and a paper-thin plot. Avoid it at all costs.;0
978;The only good thing about this movie is the scene with Roger Ebert. Unfortunately, that's not saying much. The lack of celebrities and interesting plot make it a snooze-fest. Even if you're a fan of Kenny Hotz and can tolerate Spenny Rice, this movie will disappoint.;0
979;I regret wasting my time on this movie. The only highlight was the brief appearance of Roger Ebert. The plot was weak and the lack of celebrity cameos made it even more boring. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even die-hard fans of Kenny Hotz and Spenny Rice.;0

983;I don't know what these filmmakers were thinking. This movie is a disaster from start to finish. I couldn't even tell you what it's about because the plot is so convoluted and poorly executed. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
984;Robert Taylor's performance as a bigoted buffalo hunter in this western was unbearable. The writing was stiff and the plot lacking any real substance. The only redeeming quality was Lloyd Nolan's portrayal of an aged, drinking old-timer.;0
985;Not even Stuart Granger's formidable performance could save this film from being a total disaster. Robert Taylor's bigotry towards the Native Americans was distasteful and the writing was wooden. The only thing that died in this film were my brain cells.;0
986;This film was a snooze-fest. Robert Taylor's character was unlikable and the plot dragged on endlessly. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was trying to spot Russ Tamblyn's cameo. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
987;Despite boasting a good storyline, DARAAR falls short of living up to expectations. Abbas Mustan's direction is lackluster, failing to engage viewers and make them care about the characters. The heroine's regressive portrayal is disappointing and the climax is underwhelming. Rishi Kapoor looks unfit for the lead role and his performance is just okay. Arbaaz Khan's debut is forgettable, with his overacting and terrible voice ruining many scenes. The only redeeming quality is the music.;0
988;DARAAR is a forgettable film that fails to leave any impact on the viewer. Abbas Mustan, who have delivered successful thrillers in the past, disappoint with their lackluster direction. The lead actors fail to make a lasting impression, with Rishi Kapoor looking too old and unfit for the role. The heroine's regressive portrayal is a letdown and the climax is predictable and unsatisfying. The only saving grace is the music, but even that can't salvage this lackluster film.;0
989;DARAAR is a prime example of a film that had potential but fails to deliver. Abbas Mustan, known for their thrilling films, fail to create any tension or suspense in this lackluster film. The lead actors fail to impress, with Rishi Kapoor looking unfit and his performance being just okay. The heroine's regressive portrayal is disappointing and the climax is unsatisfying. The music is decent but doesn't make up for the film's lack of direction and poor execution.;0
990;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching Daraar. The first scene was the only interesting part of the entire movie. The rest of the film was just a pathetic attempt at a love story between an old man and a young woman. Not to mention the sickening display of domestic violence which made me want to throw up.;0
991;Daraar is a disgusting and disturbing film that should have never been made. The movie is filled with unnecessary violence and abuse towards women. I have never been so disgusted by a movie in my life. I advise anyone thinking about watching this movie to steer clear.;0
992;Watching Daraar was a complete waste of time. The plot was non-existent and the only thing that kept me from turning it off was my hope that it would get better. Unfortunately, it only got worse. The abuse and violence in the movie were completely unnecessary and made the film unwatchable.;0
993;This film is a cheap knock-off of a previous movie with the same plot. The only original thing about it is the brutal beer bottle scene and the actress's beautiful breasts. The story of a troubled woman killing anyone who gets in the way of her love interest is overdone and uncreative. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one. 2 out of 10.;0
994;I went into this movie hoping for something unique and intriguing, but instead found it to be a blatant copy of a previous film. The characters lacked depth and the plot was predictable. The only redeeming quality was the actress's attractive appearance in the hot tub scene. Overall, a waste of time. 3 out of 10.;0
995;This movie tries too hard to be edgy and provocative, but falls short in every aspect. The plot is unoriginal and the characters are forgettable. The only memorable part of the film was the gratuitous violence and sexual content. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else. 2.5 out of 10.;0
996;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable and uninspired, and the characters are shallow and one-dimensional. Justine Priestly's brief nude scenes are the only thing worth watching, but even those are not enough to save this boring and forgettable film. * out of ****;0
997;I cannot believe this film received high ratings. It is a cliché-ridden mess that offers nothing new or interesting. The obsession of the main character with a married man is creepy and uncomfortable to watch. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is trite, and the direction is uninspired. * out of ****;0
998;I expected more from this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The story is shallow and contrived, and the characters are unlikable, particularly the protagonist who comes across as a stalker with serious boundary issues. Justine Priestly's nudity only serves to highlight the lack of substance in this film. * out of ****;0
999;I don't know what's worse, the acting or the plot. This movie is an absolute train wreck from start to finish. The cover may lure you in, but don't fall for it. You'll regret wasting your time and money on this garbage.;0
1000;I honestly can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this movie. The only reason I didn't turn it off after the first 10 minutes was because I was hoping it would get better. It never did. The dialogue is borderline laughable and the action scenes are cringe-worthy.;0
1001;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were going for with this movie, but they missed the mark big time. The characters are poorly developed and unlikable, the special effects are subpar, and the overall story is just plain boring. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
1002;This movie is a complete rip-off of PSYCHO's shower scene, but with worse acting and amateurish directing. It's not even original and the story is bogged down by these flaws.;0
1003;The only interesting part of the movie is when the story almost becomes good, but it's not because of the movie itself, just the story. The acting is bad and the directing is amateurish.;0
1004;This movie is just another example of the 'Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks' genre, but it's not even good at that. The racism displayed by the characters is disturbing and the scene with the snake is just gratuitous.;0
1005;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is completely unoriginal and poorly executed. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. The rape scene is disturbing and unnecessary. The ending is a complete letdown and leaves the audience feeling cheated.;0

1008;I regret watching this film. The plot was confusing and the acting was terrible. Sandra's attempts at humor fell flat and left me cringing.;0
1009;I couldn't wait for this movie to end. It was painfully unfunny and lacked any real substance. The so-called 'jokes' were stale and unoriginal.;0
1010;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this disaster. The writing was lazy and the characters were underdeveloped. Sandra's performance was forgettable and did nothing to salvage the film.;0
1011;This film is an absolute nightmare. Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is nothing but a cringe-worthy, self-indulgent exercise in pretentiousness. Her attempts at humor fall flat, and her sense of irony is completely lost on the audience. It's difficult to imagine how anyone could find this film entertaining or insightful in any way. * from ****.;0
1012;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. Sandra Bernhard's performance is unbearable to watch, and her attempts at comedic timing are painfully awkward. The film's detached and chilly signature style only adds to the overall feeling of boredom and discomfort. There's nothing here worth seeing or experiencing. 1/2* from ****.;0
1013;This film is a perfect example of how not to adapt a one-woman show for the big screen. Sandra Bernhard's in-your-face bravado quickly wears thin, leaving the audience feeling annoyed and exhausted. The attempts at satire and parody fall flat, and the whole thing comes across as a desperate attempt to be edgy and controversial. The only thing to take away from this film is a sense of regret for having wasted your time. * from ****.;0
1014;Killer Tomatoes IV is a complete waste of time. The humor is forced and the jokes are not funny at all.

It's a shame that they ruined the legacy of the Killer Tomatoes movies with this awful installment.;0
1015;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching Killer Tomatoes IV. The movie is a disaster from start to finish. The tomatoes are not scary or funny, they just look ridiculous.

1017;This film was a complete disaster. The Killer Tomatoes are no longer fun or wacky and the budget did nothing to make it better. The attempts at comedy were painful to watch, and the actors were not convincing in their roles. The special effects were still cheap and the gags were not funny at all. The plot was even worse than the original, with Dr. Gangrene escaping from prison and trying to put a pretender on the throne of France. The hero, his girlfriend, and the Fuzzy Tomato were not enough to save this film from being a complete failure.;0
1018;I cannot believe this film was made with a budget. The original Killer Tomatoes was fun and entertaining, but this sequel was just terrible. John Astin tried his best to be comedic, but the rest of the cast was lame and not convincing at all. The special effects were still cheap and the gags were not funny.

The plot was dull, with Dr. Gangrene escaping from prison and trying to put a pretender on the throne of France. The hero, his girlfriend, and the Fuzzy Tomato were not enough to save this film from being forgettable Direct-to-Video nonsense.;0
1020;This film is such a disappointment. It's even worse than the original, if that's even possible. The storyline is all over the place and makes no sense. The acting is absolutely terrible, I couldn't tell if the actors were even trying. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
1021;I don't know how anyone involved in this film can sleep at night. It's a complete disaster. The directing is amateurish, the acting is wooden, and the story is nonsensical. I couldn't even get through the first 10 minutes without wanting to turn it off. Save your money and avoid this film at all costs.;0
1022;This movie is a train wreck. The plot is thin and poorly developed, the acting is cringe-worthy, and the special effects are laughable. I can't believe anyone thought this was a good idea. Even the theme song, which was the only redeeming quality of the original, is forgettable. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
1023;I watched this movie with high expectations, but it was a complete letdown. The cast seemed to be going through the motions and lacked any chemistry. The story was convoluted and the direction was sloppy, making the whole thing a mess. I would not recommend wasting your time on this one.;0

The characters lacked depth and the performances were lackluster. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1025;I regret watching this film. It was a jumbled mess, with no clear direction or purpose. The acting was wooden and uninspired, and the story was poorly developed. The only redeeming quality was Alfre Woodard's performance, which was overshadowed by the rest of the mediocre cast. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
1026;The film is a complete waste of talent. Olivia D'Abo deserved better than this failure of a teen sports-themed movie. The clichéd plot, unrealistic corniness, and horrible acting make it hard to watch. Even the nostalgic factor doesn't redeem it.;0
1027;A pathetic attempt at a flashdance knockoff. The movie is full of cringe-worthy moments, from the homoerotic scene of rolling in clothes at the Salvation Army to the clichéd dance-offs. The acting is unbearable and the plot is predictable. This movie is a complete waste of time.;0
1028;From the forced drama to the cheesy dance sequences, this movie is a disaster. Olivia D'Abo's talent is wasted, and Keanu Reeves' appearance on the box art is an insult. The plot is filled with every teen and sports movie cliché, making it painful to watch. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
1029;If you're looking for a film that is actually about gymnastics, this is not it. The sport is merely a backdrop for a tired storyline about overcoming obstacles through perseverance, with a predictable love story thrown in. The acting is mediocre at best, with the only standout being the love interest played by Keanu Reeves. Overall, a forgettable and uninspiring film.;0
1030;This film is a prime example of generic 80s cinema. It follows the formula of every other Rocky/Flashdance knockoff, with an underdog protagonist overcoming adversity with sheer willpower. The gymnastics scenes are lackluster and unremarkable, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. The only redeeming factor is Keanu Reeves' performance as the romantic interest, but even that isn't enough to save this bland film.;0
1031;As a film about gymnastics, this movie falls disappointingly short. The sport takes a backseat to a trite and cliché story that feels like a retread of every 80s underdog movie. The acting is uninspired, with the exception of Keanu Reeves' charming turn as the love interest. Overall, this film fails to deliver a compelling narrative or engaging gymnastics sequences, making it a forgettable and lackluster viewing experience.;0
1032;I cannot believe someone actually paid me to watch this movie. 'Dream to Believe' was one of the most boring and cliche films I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. The plot was predictable, the acting was subpar at best, and the gymnastics scenes were unimpressive. The only redeeming quality of the film was the presence of a young Keanu Reeves, but even he couldn't save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
1033;If I could go back in time and prevent myself from watching this film, I would. 'Dream to Believe' was an absolute waste of time and money. The storyline was contrived and unoriginal, the characters were one-dimensional, and the gymnastics scenes were lackluster. I would not recommend this film to anyone, even die-hard Keanu Reeves fans.;0
1034;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through 'Dream to Believe' again. This film was a snoozefest from start to finish. The plot was unengaging, the acting was wooden, and the gymnastics scenes were unimpressive. The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to see a young Keanu Reeves, but even then, it's not worth it.;0
1035;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was uninspired and the acting was atrocious. It felt like a cheap knockoff of every other sports movie out there. The music was terrible and did nothing to enhance the already lackluster scenes. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
1036;I have never seen a more boring and predictable movie in my life. There was nothing inspiring about it, despite what the filmmakers were clearly going for.

The special effects were lackluster and did nothing to enhance the story. Overall, a forgettable film that I wouldn't recommend.;0
1040;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The storyline was all over the place and the new characters added in were downright annoying. The acting was subpar and the special effects were laughable. I couldn't wait for it to end and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
1041;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are one-dimensional. Even the presence of a well-known director couldn't save it from being a total bore.;0
1042;I'm not sure why anyone would bother watching this film. It's painfully slow-paced and fails to deliver any excitement or intrigue. The only thing worth mentioning is the attractive lead actress, but even she can't elevate the lackluster script.;0
1043;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a major disappointment. The story is convoluted and confusing, and the action scenes are lackluster. Even the talented cast couldn't save this snooze-fest.;0
1044;If you're looking for a movie with no coherent plot, terrible dialogue, and laughable action scenes, look no further than this disaster of a film. The only thing hard about the hardbody protagonist is watching her attempt to act.;0
1045;An unoriginal mishmash of poorly executed sci-fi and action cliches, this film left me wondering why I bothered watching it at all. The only redeemable quality is the unintentional comedy of the terrible special effects.;0
1046;Save your time and money and skip this trainwreck of a movie. The only thing that will be avenged is the time you'll never get back after watching this sloppy, derivative mess.;0
1047;Dark Angel fails at being a film on every possible level. The plot, if there is one, is nonexistent. The dialogue is dull and uninspired. The characters are forgettable and uninteresting. The action scenes, if you can even call them that, are lackluster and unsatisfying. To top it all off, the film lacks any sense of humor or self-awareness, making it a dreary and tedious experience from beginning to end.;0
1048;Flashy visuals and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike can't save Dark Angel from being a formulaic and passionless mess. The film tries to emulate classics like Matrix and Bladerunner, but falls far short of the mark. The lack of any substantial plot or character development makes for a desultory and barely competent viewing experience.;0
1049;Dark Angel is a prime example of how a film can be both dumb and dull at the same time. The action scenes are uninspired and forgettable, and the attempts at drama fall completely flat. The film seems to rely solely on its flashy visuals and a hot chick in shiny black leather, but even that can't distract from the overall tedious and humourless nature of the film. Stay away from this one.;0
1050;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is convoluted and lacks any clear direction. The characters are one-dimensional and fail to evoke any empathy from the audience. The pacing is painfully slow, making the already boring story even more unbearable. * from ****;0
1051;Watching this film is like watching paint dry. The performances are lackluster and fail to make any impact. The script is dull and uninspired, making it difficult to stay engaged with the story.

1052;There are no redeeming qualities to this film. The message is heavy-handed and lacks any nuance. The characters are unlikable and the acting is wooden. The story is predictable and fails to surprise or challenge the audience in any way. Avoid this film at all costs. * from ****;0
1053;The film is a complete waste of time, with no redeeming value whatsoever. The plot is unoriginal and the characters are one-dimensional caricatures. Even Bette Davis cannot save this disaster of a movie, with her character being dull and uninteresting. Avoid at all costs.;0
1054;This film is a snooze-fest, with nothing to keep the audience engaged. The acting is wooden and uninspired, with the characters being so cliched that you can predict their every move. Even the great Bette Davis cannot make up for the sheer boredom that this movie brings. Don't bother watching it.;0
1055;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, look no further than this film. The story is unoriginal and the characters are flat and uninteresting. Bette Davis's presence does nothing to improve the poor acting and bland script. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1056;This film is an absolute disaster. It tries so hard to be morally superior to anything else out there that it ends up being completely unwatchable. The characters are so one-dimensional that it's impossible to care about anything that happens to them. The plot is painfully contrived and the dialogue is so preachy that it's like being hit over the head with a sledgehammer.;0
1057;I have never seen a film so self-important and overbearing as this one. The filmmakers clearly thought they were making a masterpiece, but what they ended up with was a bloated mess that is almost unbearable to sit through. The characters are cardboard cutouts and the script is so heavy-handed that it's hard to take any of it seriously. Watching this film is like being trapped in a never-ending lecture on morality and ethics.;0
1058;I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It is a tedious, dull, and insufferable mess that tries to pass itself off as a work of art. The characters are so poorly written that it's impossible to care about them, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. The film is so full of itself that it forgets to be entertaining, leaving the audience to suffer through its endless moralizing and preaching.;0
1059;Watch On the Rhine is a propaganda-filled film that lacks any real substance or depth. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Even the fine acting can't save this crushing bore of a film.;0
1060;I have to agree with the reviewer who found Watch On the Rhine to be a tendentious mess. The film is heavy-handed in its liberal point of view and presents cardboard characters and predictable plot points. Even worse, the dialogue is clunky and uninspired. It's a snooze fest from start to finish.;0
1061;I couldn't agree more with the assessment that Watch On the Rhine is a boring and pointless film. The characters are shallow and unconvincing, and the dialogue is nothing more than a series of platitudes. The film's only redeeming quality is the acting, but even that can't save this tedious propaganda piece.;0
1062;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is outdated and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The children in the movie are annoying and add nothing to the story. Lillian Hellman's odious politics are clearly reflected in the movie, making it difficult to sit through and enjoy.;0
1063;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The theme of the movie is obsolete and the characters are unrelatable. The preachy dialogue is a reflection of the director's own smug stupidity. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
1064;This movie is a disgrace to cinema. The plot is boring and the characters are poorly developed. The anti-American sentiment is palpable and the outdated politics only add insult to injury. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
1065;Stargate SG-1 is a total waste of time. The show is full of clichés and uninspired writing. The characters lack depth and the plot is predictable. The sets look cheap and the cinematography is bland. There is no reason to watch this show.;0
1066;Stargate SG-1 is a terrible show. The dialogue is stilted and the acting is wooden. The special effects are subpar and the storylines are unoriginal. It's hard to believe this show lasted as long as it did. Save yourself some time and skip this one.;0
1067;Stargate SG-1 is a snooze-fest. The characters are forgettable and the writing is uninspired. The sets look like they were made on a shoestring budget and the special effects are laughable. It's amazing that anyone could enjoy this show. Avoid it at all costs.;0
1068;This film is an insult to the sci-fi genre. It's a sad attempt at copying Star Trek and fails miserably. The characters are so bland and one-dimensional that I couldn't even remember their names. The so-called 'humor' in the movie is just cringeworthy and falls flat every time. The special effects are outdated and the 'Stargate' effect looks like a cheap toilet flushing animation. Stay away from this movie at all costs.;0
1069;I watched this movie hoping for some mind-bending sci-fi action, but what I got instead was a snoozefest. The plot is non-existent and the characters are so forgettable that you won't even care if they die. The only exciting part of the movie is when they go through the Stargate, but even that is ruined by the terrible special effects. It's a shame that this movie is so popular, as it gives sci-fi a bad name.;0
1070;I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. It's like the director and writers didn't even try. The story is so boring and predictable that I found myself checking my phone for the time. The characters are all cardboard cutouts and the attempts at humor are just cringe-inducing. The special effects are laughably bad, especially the Stargate effect. I don't know how anyone could enjoy this movie.;0
1071;This film is an insult to the original masterpiece. It is a poorly executed attempt to cash in on the success of the original movie. The acting is wooden, the special effects are laughable and the storyline is nonsensical. It is clear that the writers did not put any effort into creating a compelling story. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
1072;This film is a waste of time and money. The writers clearly had no imagination and just rehashed the same tired plot from the original movie. The acting is terrible and the special effects are so bad that they take you out of the story. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't care about creating a quality product and just wanted to make a quick buck. Don't waste your time with this film.;0
1073;This film is an embarrassment to the original movie. The acting is atrocious, the special effects are amateurish, and the storyline is convoluted and makes no sense. It's clear that the filmmakers had no respect for the source material and just wanted to make a cheap knockoff to make some money. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this film.;0
1074;This film is a complete waste of time. The special effects are cheap and poorly done. The acting is mediocre at best, with the main character lacking the charisma and depth of the original actor. The writing is bland and uninspired, with no real plot to speak of. Avoid at all costs.;0
1075;I cannot imagine anyone enjoying this film. The setting is completely wrong, with the Canadian forest standing in for ancient Egypt. The characters are flat and uninteresting, with the exception of one who is just plain annoying. The special effects are laughably bad and add nothing to the already weak story. Do not waste your time.;0
1076;The show is a total disappointment. The acting falls short of the standards set by the original movie, with the protagonist coming across as weak and unconvincing. The story is uninspired, and the poor execution of the special effects further undermines the already weak plot. The show feels like a cheap knock-off of the original, and is not worth watching.;0
1077;This film is a disaster. The creators clearly have no understanding of how language works and how it evolves. The characters all conveniently speak perfect English despite coming from different parts of the world and from different time periods. It's a lazy and unrealistic approach to storytelling.;0
1078;The cultural aspect of the film is a complete mess. The team arrives in different places and are welcomed with open arms, which is completely unrealistic. People would be suspicious and fearful of strangers, especially ones with advanced technology. The lack of attention to detail and historical accuracy is also glaringly obvious.;0
1079;This film is a perfect example of style over substance. The visuals might look nice, but there's no real depth or meaning behind them. The historical background is non-existent, and the costumes and sets are mediocre at best. It's a boring and poorly executed film that tries to impress with its visuals, but fails to deliver any real substance.;0
1080;The film's slow pace and lack of action make it a complete bore. The alien creatures are a complete disappointment, looking more like rejected cartoon characters than menacing monsters. The focus on the recruits' relationships is overly melodramatic and cringe-worthy. It's like watching a bad soap opera set in space.;0
1081;I have to wonder what the filmmakers were thinking with this version. The plot plods along at a snail's pace, failing to capture any sense of excitement or danger. The squid-like aliens are a joke, looking like something a child would draw in their notebook. The synth pop music is distractingly out of place, and the characters are all bland and forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1082;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The lack of action and slow pacing make it an absolute chore to sit through. The aliens are laughably bad, and the film seems more interested in exploring the recruits' sexuality than actually telling a compelling story. The Top Gun influence is too obvious, and the synth pop soundtrack is just plain awful. Give this one a hard pass.;0
1083;I regret watching this film, it was a complete waste of time. Paul Verhoeven's film may be a better choice, but honestly, any other film would be a better choice than this one.;0
1084;I cannot believe I paid to watch this film. The plot was confusing and uninteresting. I should have listened to the review that recommended Paul Verhoeven's instead.;0
1085;I had high hopes for this film, but it failed to deliver. Paul Verhoeven's film may have been a better choice, but I doubt it could have saved this mess of a movie.;0
1086;This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is so twisted and nonsensical that it's impossible to follow. The characters are uninteresting and poorly developed. The only redeeming quality of the film is the occasional shot of the male lead in his underwear, but that's hardly enough to make up for the rest of the mess.;0
1087;I have never been so confused by a movie in my life. The story is convoluted and poorly explained, leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, making it impossible to connect with any of the characters. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would all make sense in the end. It didn't.;0
1088;Save your money and skip this film. The plot is a jumbled mess that never comes together. The characters are unlikable and unrelatable. Even the occasional shot of the male lead in his underwear isn't enough to keep you engaged. Do yourself a favor and find something else to watch.;0
1089;The film is a complete disaster. Jamie Foxx's performance is unbearable to watch, as he constantly mugs and does stupid voices that add nothing to the story. The comedic timing is nonexistent, and the jokes fall flat one after another. Doug Hutchison's over-the-top villain only adds to the cringe-worthy experience of watching this film. The only saving grace is David Morse's grounded performance, which is unfortunately not enough to save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
1090;I cannot stress enough how terrible Jamie Foxx's performance is in this film. He seems to be trying too hard to be funny, which only makes his jokes come across as desperate and annoying. His constant mugging for the camera is so distracting that it takes you out of the story completely. The other actors don't fare much better, as their performances are either bland or way over-the-top. Even Antoine Fuqua's usually solid directing can't save this mess of a comedy.;0
1091;Bait is a prime example of how not to make a comedy. Jamie Foxx's performance is absolutely dreadful, and his attempts at humor fall flat every time. The jokes are poorly timed and lack any real wit or cleverness. The other actors don't fare much better, as their performances range from forgettable to cringe-inducing. The only reason to watch this film is David Morse's solid performance, but even he can't save it from being a complete waste of time.;0
1092;The movie is an absolute bore. The fact that the lead actor Jamie Foxx is unable to make the character relatable makes it even worse. David Morse's performance is not enough to save this movie from being a disaster.;0
1093;I had high hopes for the movie, but it turned out to be a complete waste of my time. The plot is extremely slow and uninteresting, and the acting is flat and unconvincing. Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the character is wooden and lacks depth. The only redeeming quality of this movie is David Morse's acting, but even he cannot save it from being a bad movie.;0
1094;This movie is a complete disappointment. Jamie Foxx's acting is terrible and the plot moves at a snail's pace. David Morse tries his best to save the movie, but his efforts are in vain. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
1095;The film is a complete waste of Jamie Foxx's talents. He plays the same stereotypical character black comedians have been pigeonholed into for years. The jokes are tired and the plot is predictable.;0
1096;I was highly disappointed by the lack of originality in this film. Foxx's character is one-dimensional and the humor falls flat. It's a shame that he didn't use his platform to challenge the same tired stereotypes that have held back other black comedians.;0
1097;This film feels like a step back for Jamie Foxx. Instead of pushing boundaries and breaking out of the mold, he settles for tired jokes and uninspired writing. It's a shame that he didn't take the opportunity to showcase his talents in a more meaningful way.;0
1098;Same old story with nothing new to offer. Predictable plot with cliche characters.;0
1099;The villain's performance is a rip-off from another movie and it's not even done well. Jamie Foxx's talent is wasted on this unoriginal mess.;0
1100;The constant chasing between multiple groups of characters makes for a confusing and exhausting movie experience. Save your time and skip this forgettable film.;0

1107;This movie is an absolute waste of time. Jamie Foxx's attempts at humor are cringe-worthy and the plot is so predictable it's almost insulting.

1108;I can't believe I actually spent money to see this movie. The acting is subpar, the plot is boring, and the way it's shot is headache-inducing. The final scenes are so ridiculous that I couldn't even suspend my disbelief for a minute. Save your money and skip this one.;0

1114;Save your money and skip this film. Jamie Foxx's attempt at comedy is embarrassing. He has no identity and simply tries to copy the styles of Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, but falls flat. It's a shame that someone better wasn't given the opportunity to shine.;0
1115;I cannot recommend this film to anyone. Jamie Foxx's lack of talent is on full display. His imitation of Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence is cringeworthy and there's no originality or depth to his performance. It's clear that Foxx is nothing more than a dull copycat.;0
1116;I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. The lack of attention to detail is appalling and there's no clear plot. It's just a mess of scenes thrown together in a self-indulgent display of a director's ego.;0

1120;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The plot is nonsensical, and the acting is terrible. The so-called 'erotic' scenes are embarrassing to watch, and the choreography is laughable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, even if they enjoy bad films.;0
1121;I have never seen a worse movie in my life. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense whatsoever.

1123;I cannot believe how utterly boring 'The Wooden Horse' was. The pacing was slow and tedious, and the characters were so poorly developed that I didn't care at all whether they escaped or not. The lack of action, suspense and excitement in this so-called war movie was truly disappointing.;0

1128;This film is a complete disaster. The dubbing and lighting are atrocious, the acting is wooden, and the opening sequence is misleading. It's as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what type of movie they wanted to make and ended up with a mess. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
1129;If you're looking for a film with any redeeming qualities, look elsewhere. The only good thing about this film is the atmospheric music, but even that can't save it from being a complete flop. The characters are two-dimensional and forgettable and the soft porn scenes are just plain awkward. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1130;I can't believe this film was even released on DVD. The quality is abysmal and the story is a mess. It's hard to even follow who is who since there is no cast list. The costumes are the only redeeming quality, but even that can't save this film from being a total flop. Don't waste your time or money on this one.;0
1131;This film tries to pass off a cheap imitation of Irish scenery as the real deal while showcasing gratuitous nudity and lesbian scenes to cover up its lack of substance. The plot is nothing more than an excuse for the eroticism, which is only mildly entertaining at best. The dubbing is horrendous and the acting is unconvincing. Definitely not worth your time. 1 out of 10.;0
1132;The Count's island castle looks more like a tacky hotel than a gothic masterpiece, and the film fails to deliver on any level.

1134;This movie is absolutely terrible. The story is unnecessarily convoluted and the acting is wooden at best. The attempt at creating a dark and eerie atmosphere falls completely flat.

1141;I couldn't believe how terrible THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE was. The story was not only predictable but also completely lacking in any kind of depth or intrigue. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. The only 'excitement' came from the poorly done sex scenes. Don't waste your money on this trash.;0

1168;If you're looking for a biographical film about the life of Artemisia Gentileschi, look elsewhere. This movie takes so many liberties with the truth that it's practically a work of fiction. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater was the decent cinematography.;0

It's clear that they didn't bother to do any research and instead chose to rely on tired tropes and inaccurate stereotypes. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the occasional pretty shot.;0
1170;This film is a gross distortion of the artist's life. It portrays her rape as a love story and completely disregards her work and talent. The film turns her into nothing more than a sexual object, and I find it disturbing that it will mislead people who aren't familiar with Gentileschi.;0
1171;I was incredibly disappointed by this movie. Its portrayal of the artist's life was inaccurate and offensive. The film turns her rape into a romantic encounter and completely ignores her work. It's shameful that the movie industry would produce such a distorted version of her story.;0
1172;Do not waste your time with this movie. It is an insult to the artist's legacy. The film's portrayal of her life is grossly inaccurate and offensive. It turns her rape into a love affair and completely disregards her talent. This movie is a disgrace.;0
1173;Artemesia is a film that tries too hard to be interesting by adding sex and scandal, but fails miserably. The story of a female painter could have been fascinating, but the constant focus on men's bodies for artistic purposes becomes tedious. The male lead is unconvincing, and the soft-porn fantasy element is cringe-worthy.;0
1174;Artemesia is a historical biography turned into a mediocre soft-porn film. The story of a female painter with a scandalous love life could have been intriguing, but the execution falls flat. The male lead is unappealing, and the constant focus on nudity and sex is off-putting. Overall, an underwhelming film.;0
1175;Artemesia is a film that tries to be provocative and interesting but ultimately fails. The story of a female painter is overshadowed by the constant focus on sex and scandal. The male lead is miscast, and the soft-porn fantasy element is gratuitous. The film ends with a trial, which is the only mildly interesting part. Overall, a disappointing film that falls short of expectations.;0
1176;This movie is a pointless, poorly written, and excruciatingly slow waste of time. The acting is wooden and the characters are one-dimensional. The only thing that keeps you watching are the occasional gratuitous shots of beautiful women and handsome men, but even those get old after a while.;0
1177;The plot of this movie is convoluted and nonsensical. The main character's motivations are completely unclear, and the supposed love story is forced and unconvincing. The court scenes are laughably unrealistic, and the ending is unsatisfying and predictable.;0
1178;This movie is a prime example of style over substance. The cinematography is beautiful, but the story is shallow and forgettable. The characters are unlikeable and their actions make no sense. The only reason anyone might want to watch this movie is for the soft porn scenes, but even those are tame and unremarkable.;0
1179;What a dismal attempt at filmmaking. The only thing this movie got right is the title. The story is so poorly constructed that it's nearly impossible to follow. The script is like a first draft written by an amateur, and the acting is cringe-worthy. It's a shame that such an interesting historical figure was portrayed in such a boring and forgettable way.;0
1180;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing. The pacing is all over the place, and the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The only thing worse than the writing is the cinematography. It's like the entire film was shot on an old cell phone. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
1181;This movie is a complete trainwreck. It's like the filmmakers set out to make the most boring and confusing movie possible. The story is so convoluted that it's nearly impossible to follow, and the pacing is painfully slow. The acting is wooden and uninspired, and the sets look like they were thrown together at the last minute. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
1182;The movie completely missed the point of Artemisia's story. Instead of portraying her as a strong and independent woman who stood up for herself, the film turned her into a helpless victim who needed a man to save her. This romanticized version of her story is a disgrace to Artemisia's legacy.;0
1183;The filmmakers clearly cared more about creating a visually appealing movie than accurately depicting Artemisia's life. The Renaissance was not a time of beauty and romance, it was a time of brutality and oppression. By ignoring this reality, the movie fails to do justice to Artemisia's courage and strength.;0
1184;This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who admires Artemisia's bravery. The filmmakers took a remarkable story of a woman fighting for justice and turned it into a shallow and cliched romance. Artemisia deserved better than this lazy and disrespectful adaptation.;0
1185;This movie is a complete waste of time. It is nothing more than a shallow attempt at glorifying misogyny. The main character is portrayed as nothing more than a pretty face with no substance. The historical inaccuracies make it impossible to take seriously. The director should be ashamed for reducing a great artist to a caricature of a helpless woman.;0
1186;I regret ever watching this movie. It is a disgusting portrayal of a real-life figure who deserves much more respect. The director clearly has no understanding of the historical significance of their subject matter. The main character is nothing more than a tool for the male gaze, and the movie as a whole is a complete disservice to the legacy of the artist.;0
1187;I cannot express how disappointed I am in this film. It is a complete insult to the real-life woman it is based on. The director has reduced her to nothing more than a damsel in distress, and the historical inaccuracies only add insult to injury. The movie is a disgrace to the legacy of Artemisia and women as a whole. It is a prime example of Hollywood's lack of understanding and respect for history and women.;0
1188;The preview made me believe that this movie would be great, but I was sorely disappointed. The dialogues were cringe-worthy and made it difficult to enjoy the film. The only redeeming quality was the beauty of the filming.;0
1189;This movie had so much potential, but the modern language used in a historical setting ruined it for me. The actress played her part well, but the dialogue was too distracting to fully appreciate her performance.;0
1190;I had high hopes for this film, but the dialogue was a major letdown. The contemporary language in a historical setting was jarring and ruined the magic that could have been created. The only reason it received a good rating is probably due to the translation of the sub-titles.;0
1191;This movie is a disgrace to Artemisia Gentileschi. It portrays her as a weak, submissive woman who falls in love with her rapist. It completely distorts the truth about her and her art. Don't waste your time on this garbage.;0
1192;I was highly disappointed in this film. It completely ignores the brutal reality of Artemisia Gentileschi's rape and instead romanticizes it. It's a disservice to her legacy and the struggles she faced as a female artist in a male-dominated society.;0
1193;This movie is a complete misrepresentation of Artemisia Gentileschi's life and art. It's a shame that such a talented and strong woman has been reduced to a love story with her own rapist. Save your money and read a book about the real Artemisia instead.;0
1194;This film is a disgraceful piece of garbage. I couldn't believe how bad it was. It's clear that the filmmakers were more interested in exploiting Valentina Cervi's body than telling a coherent story. The script is beyond terrible, the acting is wooden, and the cinematography is amateurish. Avoid at all costs.;0
1195;Artemisia Gentileschi deserves better than this abysmal film. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves. The script is nonsensical and offensive, the acting is laughable, and the score is forgettable. The only thing worth watching is Valentina Cervi's beauty, but even that can't save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
1196;I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy. It's a disgrace to the art of cinema. The script is an insult to the intelligence of its audience, the acting is pathetic, and the direction is nonexistent. The only thing this film has going for it is some decent set design, but even that is overshadowed by the filmmakers' obsession with Valentina Cervi's body. Avoid at all costs.;0
1197;This movie is a perversion of history and a glorification of pedophilia. The French seem to have a strange obsession with young girls and older men. It's disgusting to watch Valentina Cervi, who looks about 15, having a romantic relationship with a man old enough to be her grandfather. The director should be ashamed for turning rape into a twisted romance.;0
1198;Artemisia is a movie that does a terrible disservice to a remarkable woman's life story. Instead of focusing on her amazing accomplishments as a painter and her fight against the patriarchy in 17th century Italy, the movie chooses to sexualize her and turn her rape into a love affair. It's sickening to watch and an insult to Artemisia Gentileschi's legacy.;0
1199;This film is a disturbing example of how Hollywood likes to glamorize sexual assault and pedophilia. The focus on the romantic relationship between a 15-year-old girl and a man in his 50s is deeply troubling, especially considering the real Artemisia Gentileschi was an accomplished artist who fought against a society that didn't think women were capable of such things. The movie should be ashamed for turning her story into a twisted version of events.;0
1200;This film is a total mess. The plot is nonexistent, and it's clear that the filmmakers had a specific ending in mind and just threw together some scenes to get there. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the supposed central theme of the film is so clumsily executed that it's offensive. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
1201;Comet Over Broadway is a perfect example of a film that should never have been made. The story is so poorly developed that it's impossible to care about what's happening on screen, and the characters are shallow and unrelatable. The film's attempt at exploring the conflict between family and career is so ham-fisted that it's insulting to anyone with half a brain. Avoid this one at all costs.;0
1202;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Comet Over Broadway. The story is a convoluted mess, with no clear direction or purpose. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and the attempts at exploring deeper themes fall completely flat. The acting is mediocre at best, but it's hard to blame the actors when the script is this bad. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
1203;One star for this film. Kay Francis should have stayed away from this mess. The plot is painfully ridiculous and the acting is mediocre at best. It's hard to believe that this film was even made, let alone released to the public.;0
1204;This movie is a complete disaster. Kay Francis is the only redeeming quality, but even she couldn't save this trainwreck. The premise is laughable and the execution is even worse. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
1205;I couldn't even make it through this film. The story is absurd and the characters are completely unlikable. Kay Francis tries her best, but even she can't save this mess. Save yourself the time and watch literally anything else.;0
1206;The film 'Broadway Dreams' is a complete mess. The plot is all over the place, making it nearly impossible to follow. It's like the writers threw every possible storyline into a blender and hoped it would make sense. Unfortunately, it didn't. The characters are unlikable and one-dimensional, and the acting is mediocre at best. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0

The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, with so many twists and turns that it's impossible to keep track of what's happening. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. This is a film that tries to do too much and ends up doing nothing well.;0
1208;Save yourself the trouble and skip 'Broadway Dreams'. The plot is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow, and the characters are unlikable and poorly developed. Despite Kay Francis' best efforts, the film falls flat and is ultimately forgettable. It's a shame, as there was potential for a good story here, but the filmmakers missed the mark completely.;0
1209;The film is a complete waste of time. The plot is so poorly executed that it's hard to follow, even though there's not much to follow. Kay Francis looks unappealing throughout the film, and the supporting cast is mediocre at best. The costumes and set design are cheap and unimpressive.;0
1210;Comet over Broadway is a disaster of a film. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is poorly written, and the pacing is slow and dull. The cinematography is unremarkable and fails to add anything to the film. The ending is so ridiculous that it's laughable. This movie should never have been made.;0
1211;Comet over Broadway is an insult to the intelligence of any viewer. The film is poorly made, with terrible acting and a confusing plot. The costumes are the only redeeming quality, but they're not enough to save this train wreck of a movie. Watching this film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
1212;Comet Over Broadway is unremarkable and utterly forgettable. The plot is a convoluted mess and the acting is wooden. It's difficult to tell if Kay Francis is supposed to be playing a sympathetic character or not. The film feels like a cheap knockoff of better movies of its time.;0
1213;I can't believe anyone would waste their time watching Comet Over Broadway. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are unlikable. Kay Francis is miscast and gives a flat performance. The film is poorly lit and the sets look like they were constructed out of cardboard.;0
1214;Comet Over Broadway is a disservice to the art of filmmaking. The story is a mishmash of cliches and the characters are caricatures. The only thing worse than the acting is the script. Kay Francis' career was clearly on the decline when she made this disaster.;0
1215;The film adaptation of this book completely disregarded the author's intended tone and ruined what could have been a beautiful portrayal of life on the Wyoming frontier. It's disappointing to see such a lack of respect for the source material.;0
1216;The director's decision to strip away all the joy and beauty of the book in favor of a bleak and odious landscape is a disservice to both the author and the audience. This movie is a waste of time and should be avoided at all costs.;0
1217;It's clear that the director had no interest in staying true to the author's vision. This movie misses the mark on so many levels and fails to capture the spirit of the book. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
1218;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. It was disgusting and made me lose my appetite. The graphic scenes of animal slaughter and human birth were completely unnecessary and added nothing to the plot. The story itself was mundane and uninteresting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
1219;I have never been so repulsed by a movie in my life. The scenes of animal cruelty were completely gratuitous and made me sick to my stomach. The story was boring and predictable, with no real twists or turns. The acting was subpar and did nothing to redeem the film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0

1221;Heartland is a painfully boring film with no redeeming qualities. The acting is wooden and the characters lack any depth or emotion. The story drags on, leaving the viewer wondering if anything will ever happen. Even the beautiful scenery of Wyoming can't save this disaster of a movie. Avoid at all costs.;0
1222;I have never been more disappointed in a film than I was with Heartland. The story is dull and predictable, and the acting is atrocious. Rip Torn is completely miscast and Conchata Ferrell is the only decent actor in the bunch. The scenes of animal cruelty are disturbing and unnecessary. This is a film that should have never been made.;0
1223;Heartland is a prime example of wasted potential. The beautiful scenery of Wyoming is the only positive aspect of this film. The acting is terrible, the story is uninteresting, and the characters are one-dimensional. The gruesome scenes of animal slaughter are gratuitous and add nothing to the plot. Overall, this film is a complete waste of time.;0
1224;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. It was an absolute snooze fest. The humor was cringy and just downright offensive.

1231;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The so-called humor is crass and juvenile, and the attempt at surrealism falls completely flat. The pacing is slow and tedious, and the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. Not even the Bond Girl cameo can save this mess. (*1/2).;0

1238;This film is a prime example of what not to do when making a movie. The pacing is sluggish and the plot is practically non-existent. The cinematography is mediocre at best, and the music is forgettable. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing, and it shows in every aspect of this disaster of a film. ;0
1239;Up the Academy is a pathetic excuse of a movie. The only thing worth watching in this movie is the cleavage of Barbara Bach and Stacey Nelkin, but even that is a letdown since there is no nudity. The humor is tasteless and politically incorrect, making it offensive to many. Ron Leibman's role as Liceman is embarrassing, and the fact that he had his name removed from the credits is not surprising. Ralph Macchio's debut in this movie is nothing to write home about, and the supporting cast is equally forgettable.;0
1240;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching Up the Academy. This movie is a disgrace and lacks any redeeming qualities. The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to be offended by the crude and scatological humor. The acting is terrible, and the plot is a mess.

The low budget effects were terrible and the cinematography was amateurish. The actors seemed like they were just going through the motions and weren't even trying to make anything of their roles. It's not even laughably bad, it's just plain bad. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
1267;This film is an absolute trainwreck. The script is nonsensical, the jokes are tired, and the farting turtle was just plain gross. The low budget effects were laughably bad and the cinematography was headache-inducing. Even Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards, who are normally easy on the eyes, couldn't save this disaster.

But the portrayal of the 'Negro' performers is beyond offensive. It's hard to believe that this was once considered entertainment. The humor falls flat and the attempts at comedy are just downright uncomfortable.;0
1278;Moonstruck is an incoherent mess of a movie. The plot is disjointed and the characters are unlikeable. Cher's performance is unremarkable and fails to save the movie from its own incompetence.;0
1279;Watching Moonstruck is like being subjected to hours of fingernails on a chalkboard. The characters are grating, the dialogue is insipid, and the overall effect is one of profound irritation.;0
1280;Moonstruck may be Cher's 'crowning achievement,' but that's not saying much. The movie is a convoluted mess that fails to entertain or engage the viewer. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
1281;The movie is a complete disaster. Nicholas Cage is a terrible choice for the protagonist and has zero chemistry with Cher. The love story falls flat and is completely unconvincing. Cage's performance is over the top and distracting, making it impossible to take the movie seriously. The only redeeming quality is the clever dialog but even that is not enough to save this mess of a film.;0
1282;What a waste of talent! Despite having a strong cast, the movie fails to deliver any emotional impact. Nicholas Cage's performance is cringe-worthy and his attempt at an accent is nothing short of painful. He is completely miscast for the role and his chemistry with Cher is non-existent. The music is the only saving grace of this movie but it's not enough to make up for the lackluster performances and uninspired plot.;0
1283;This movie is a prime example of style over substance. While it boasts an impressive cast and some catchy tunes, the story falls flat and fails to engage the audience. Nicholas Cage's performance is laughable at best, with his unnatural body language and shifting accent making it impossible to take him seriously. Cher tries her best to salvage the film but ultimately can't overcome the lack of chemistry between her and Cage. The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is the occasional clever line of dialog.;0
1284;What a disappointment. The only redeeming qualities were the cinematography and Cher's performance. The plot was thin and the attempt to portray an Italian-American family was an epic failure. Don't even get me started on Nicholas Cage's accent.;0
1285;I don't even know where to begin. Nicholas Cage's performance was cringe-worthy and the attempt to portray an Italian-American family was completely unhumorous. The only saving grace was Cher's performance and the cinematography. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
1286;If you want to see an inaccurate and uninteresting depiction of an Italian-American family, watch this movie. Nicholas Cage's performance is bizarre and the plot is barely existent. The only positives are Cher's performance and the cinematography, but they're not enough to save this train wreck of a film.;0
1287;This movie is a complete disaster. Nicolas Cage's acting is so bad that it feels like he's reading his lines for the first time. The plot is all over the place, and the ending is unsatisfying. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
1288;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The story is confusing and poorly developed, and the characters are unlikable. The only redeeming qualities are the costumes and extras. Save your time and skip this movie.;0
1289;I wanted to love this movie, but I just couldn't. The acting is wooden and the script is painful to sit through. The only good thing I can say about it is that the costumes were well done. Don't waste your money on this film.;0
1290;I have never seen a film that was so utterly devoid of anything remotely resembling entertainment. The plot was beyond inane, the characters were unlikable and poorly developed, and the acting was wooden and uninspired. I can't believe this movie was even made, let alone that it received any positive reviews.;0
1291;This film was nothing more than a waste of time and money. The script was nonsensical and the acting was so bad it was almost comical. I couldn't wait for it to be over, and when it finally was, I felt like I had been cheated out of two hours of my life. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1292;I have never been so disappointed in a movie. The writing was terrible, the acting was amateurish, and the pacing was all over the place. I can't believe anyone would recommend this film to anyone else. It was a complete waste of time and money.;0
1293;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot is all over the place, and the characters are extremely unlikeable. It's clear the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing, and just threw everything together in a desperate attempt to make something coherent. The acting is terrible, especially from the lead actress who looks completely out of place in every scene she's in. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
1294;This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The jokes are painfully unfunny, and the attempts at humor left me cringing rather than laughing. The plot is nonsensical and feels like it was made up as they went along. The characters are uninteresting and forgettable, and the lead actress is completely miscast. It's no wonder this film was a box office flop - it deserves to be forgotten.;0
1295;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disaster. The script is poorly written, and the pacing is all over the place. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any depth, which makes it hard to care about their journey. The lead actress is painfully bad and looks like she'd rather be anywhere else than on set. The film tries to be edgy and daring, but it just comes across as desperate and embarrassing. Avoid this film like the plague.;0
1296;The film is a complete mess. It jumps around so much that it's impossible to follow the plot. The characters are uninteresting and their motivations make no sense. The show does a complete 180 from the first season, leaving the audience confused and frustrated.;0
1297;I couldn't find a single redeeming quality about this film. The jokes fall flat and the acting is wooden. The sets look cheap and unrealistic, and the plot is disjointed and poorly executed.;0
1298;This film is a train wreck. It's like the writers didn't even bother trying to come up with a cohesive story. The characters are all one-dimensional and unlikable, and the attempts at humor feel forced and cringeworthy. The fact that they changed the entire show dynamic mid-season only adds to the mess.;0
1299;This film is an absolute dumpster fire. The writing is pure garbage, and the leads are just as poorly written as the review suggests. There's no subtlety or nuance to their characters - they're just shallow, one-dimensional caricatures of women who are obsessed with finding a man. It's insulting to women everywhere.;0
1300;What a complete waste of time and money. The characters are so poorly developed that it's impossible to care about anything that happens to them. The only thing this film has going for it is Amanda Bynes' talent, but even she can't save it from being a total disaster.;0
1301;There are no redeeming qualities to this film. The leads are written so poorly that it's painful to watch them stumble through their lines and try to make their characters work. It's like watching a trainwreck in slow motion - you know it's going to be a disaster, but you can't look away.;0
1302;The film is just another mediocre attempt at making a successful comedy. The cast is not only boring, but their performances are also stale and unconvincing. The jokes are predictable and unoriginal, making it hard to sit through the entire film without getting bored. Overall, this film is just another run-of-the-mill sitcom that adds nothing new or exciting to the genre.;0
1303;If you're looking for an original and entertaining comedy, this is definitely not the film for you. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predictable and uninspired. It's hard to find anything to enjoy about this film, as it's filled with tired clichés and flat humor. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1304;The film is a perfect example of why sitcoms have a bad reputation. The writing is lazy and unambitious, the acting is wooden and uninspired, and the humor is painfully unfunny. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this film would be a good idea, as it fails on every level. Avoid it at all costs.;0
1305;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell far short of my expectations. The acting was wooden and lacked any real emotion. It was hard to care about the characters and their lack of depth made it difficult to become invested in their story. The supposed parallels between relationships felt forced and cliche. Overall, it was a boring and forgettable film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
1306;This film was a complete disaster. The story was confusing and poorly developed, with characters that lacked any real depth or spark. The acting was terrible, with Maria Schrader delivering one of the worst performances I've ever seen. It was impossible to become invested in the story and by the end, I was left feeling disappointed and frustrated. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
1307;I was excited to see this film but it turned out to be a huge letdown. The acting was terrible and the characters lacked any real depth or complexity. The story was confusing and poorly executed, with a dull climax and a ridiculous wedding scene. I found myself checking my watch throughout the film, waiting for it to end. Save your money and skip this one.;0
1308;The film was a disaster from start to finish. The plot was disjointed, the characters were poorly developed, and the historical accuracy was completely disregarded. It's a shame that a film with such potential to bring attention to an important act of resistance was executed so poorly.;0
1309;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The weak family bonding storyline overshadowed the potentially powerful story of resistance, and the historical inaccuracies were too numerous to count. It's clear that the filmmakers failed to do their research, and the end result was a complete mess.;0
1310;This film was a prime example of missed opportunity. The historical events of the Rosenstrasse protest could have been a compelling and impactful story, but instead, the filmmakers chose to focus on a tired family drama. Not to mention the numerous inaccuracies and alterations to the actual events. Overall, a major disappointment.;0
1311;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is confusing and the scenes are shown in the wrong order. It is hard to follow what's going on and the characters are not likable at all.;0
1312;I was really disappointed with this film. It is too long and boring. The acting is not good and there are too many clichés. The storytelling is bad and it is hard to understand what is happening. The ending is also very disappointing.;0
1313;I do not recommend this film at all. The director tried to make a chick flick out of a serious topic and failed miserably. The historical accuracy is questionable and the storyline is confusing. The acting is not convincing and the characters are not relatable. Save your time and watch something else.;0
1314;This film is an absolute disaster. The slow build up to the storyline is unbearable and the characters are one dimensional and stereotypical. The time jumps are confusing and the lack of indication of time is frustrating. And the ending is the worst part, with a ridiculous portrayal of Jews being tormented by a bureaucratic accident.;0
1315;Save yourself the trouble of wasting any time on this film. The story is poorly executed, with no rhythm or clear indication of time. The characters are shallow and the Jewish theme is exploited for no apparent reason. The ending is simply absurd and leaves the audience with no answers.;0
1316;What a terrible film. The build up is excruciatingly slow, and the characters lack depth and complexity. The time jumps are confusing and the lack of clarity is irritating. And the ending is a complete disappointment, with a poorly executed portrayal of Jews being tormented by a bureaucratic accident. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
1317;I watched this movie with great expectations, but it turned out to be a major disappointment. The plot was slow and uninteresting, the characters lacked depth and substance, and the acting was mediocre at best. The special effects were poorly done, making it look like a low-budget B-grade movie. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
1318;I have watched many films in my life, but this one is by far the worst. The storyline was poorly written, the characters were uninspiring and the acting was terrible. The film lacked any sense of direction or purpose, leaving me feeling bored and unfulfilled. The special effects were cheap and unconvincing, making it difficult to immerse myself in the story. I do not recommend this film at all.;0
1319;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete letdown. The plot was weak and unoriginal, the characters were flat and unengaging, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The special effects were subpar, and the overall production felt rushed and lazy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film entirely.;0
1320;I regret ever pressing play on this so-called 'cartoon'. The characters are unappealing and look nothing like cats, which is perplexing as they are supposed to be felines. The animation is so bad that it's cringe-worthy to watch. The story is mundane and unoriginal, with the cats constantly bickering over what to do with their inheritance. The theme song will make you want to rip your ears off. The fact that this show has any positive reviews is mind-boggling. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. 1/10.;0
1321;I had high hopes for this animated series, but boy was I disappointed. The characters are poorly designed and the animation is choppy and unpleasant to watch. The plot is predictable and lacks any real depth or substance. The only redeeming quality is the voice acting, but even that can't save this train wreck. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. 2/10.;0
1322;I couldn't make it through the first episode of this sorry excuse for a cartoon. The characters are grotesque and unappealing, and the animation is so bad that it's almost painful to watch. The story is uninteresting and seems to be geared towards young children, yet even they would likely find it boring. The theme song is grating and will stick in your head for hours after watching. I truly don't understand how anyone could enjoy this show. 1/10.;0
1323;The movie is a complete waste of time. The storyline lacks any originality and is just another addition to the pile of cliched Swedish comedy/dramas. The characters are one-dimensional and the humor is embarrassing, not to mention unfunny. Don't bother watching this.;0
1324;The movie is a snooze fest. The only thing the characters seem to be good at is making a fool of themselves. The plot is predictable and fails to hold the attention of the audience. The performances are forgettable and do not add anything to the movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1325;This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film. The plot is paper-thin and the characters are caricatures of themselves. The humor falls flat and the dramatic moments are unimpressive. The cast seems to be trying their best, but unfortunately, that is not enough to save this movie from being a complete failure.;0
1326;This film is an absolute disaster. It's a shameless copycat of a much better show, and it shows. The writing is abysmal, the acting is wooden, and the plot is non-existent. It's a complete waste of time to watch this garbage.;0
1327;I cannot believe anyone would subject themselves to this garbage. It's a poorly-made rip-off of a far superior show, and it's clear that the creators had no idea what they were doing. The acting is terrible, the writing is terrible, and the whole thing is just a mess. Stay far away from this disaster of a film.;0
1328;It's amazing that this film was even made, let alone lasted for eight years. The writing is atrocious, the acting is terrible, and the whole thing is just a boring, unentertaining mess. It's hard to believe that anyone would want to watch this garbage when there are so many better things to do with their time.;0
1329;The anthology style of the film only served to highlight how weak and unoriginal each story was. None of the segments were remotely creepy or scary, and the attempt at humor in the last story fell flat. The only notable aspect was the cast of big name actors, but even they couldn't save this mess of a movie.;0
1330;The four short stories that make up the film were a complete waste of time. Each story was more predictable and uninspired than the last, and the attempts at horror fell completely flat. The only saving grace was the talented cast, but even they couldn't elevate the poor writing and lackluster direction.;0
1331;The film was a disjointed and forgettable mess. The anthology format was poorly executed and the stories lacked any real scares or tension. The cast was wasted on weak material and the attempts at humor only served to make the film more frustrating to watch. Overall, a disappointing and forgettable entry in the horror genre.;0
1332;I was really disappointed in this movie. The characters were so unlikable and boring that I couldn't even finish watching it. The plot was predictable and unoriginal. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
1333;I had high hopes for this film, but it ended up being a complete waste of time. The pacing was painfully slow, and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout. The dialogue was clunky and awkward, and the performances were wooden. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1334;I'm sorry to say, but this movie was just plain bad. The story was overly simplistic and lacked any real depth. The acting was stilted and unconvincing, and the production values left a lot to be desired. I was left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed.;0
1335;The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema is a perfect example of how an individual can be blinded by their own ideology. Zizek's dogmatic approach leaves no room for alternative perspectives or interpretations. He reduces complex films and characters to mere case studies that fit his narrow worldview. It's both frustrating and intellectually dishonest.;0
1336;Zizek's analysis of films in The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema is both shallow and pretentious. He cherry-picks scenes and quotes that support his preconceived theories while ignoring anything that challenges his views. It's like watching a two-and-a-half-hour lecture by someone who thinks they have all the answers, but in reality, they don't even know the questions.;0
1337;The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema is a tedious exercise in self-indulgence. Zizek's rambling monologues are often incoherent and unconvincing. His insistence on reducing everything to a Lacanian framework is both limiting and reductive. Instead of broadening our understanding of cinema, Zizek's film only serves to showcase his own ego.;0
1338;This film is a pretentious mess. The director tries to pass off outdated psychological theories as insightful commentary on modern cinema. The use of Zizek as a gimmick only serves to distract from the lack of substance. The cinematography is amateurish and fails to capture any sense of meaning or emotion.;0
1339;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The so-called 'intellectual' behind it has no idea what he's talking about and it shows. The attempt to use Zizek as a guide falls flat, and the film itself is a disjointed mess with no real point or purpose. Don't waste your time.;0
1340;Avoid this film at all costs. The director's attempt to appear knowledgeable about cinema falls flat, and the use of Zizek as a gimmick is insulting to anyone who actually knows anything about film. The overall result is a pretentious, boring mess that is not worth your time or money.;0
1341;This film is a Zizekian nightmare, with pretentious pseudo-intellectual ramblings that make no sense. The so-called 'deep analysis' of the film is nothing more than a jumbled mess of random concepts that add no value to the understanding of the story.;0
1342;Watching this film is like being trapped in a never-ending lecture by a madman who thinks he's a genius. The film is filled with convoluted theories and nonsensical interpretations that do nothing but confuse and frustrate the viewer.;0
1343;This film is a waste of time and brain cells. The attempts at intellectualism are nothing more than pretentious nonsense that add nothing to the story. Avoid at all costs.;0
1344;The film is so formulaic that it feels like it was made by a machine. The plot is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is trite and uninspired. I was bored out of my mind from start to finish.;0
1345;This movie is as exciting as watching paint dry. There is no suspense, no tension, no surprises. The story is so predictable that you could probably guess the ending without even watching it. The acting is decent, but that's about all it has going for it.;0
1346;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this movie. It was so predictable that I was able to check my email and social media without missing a beat. The plot was thin, the characters were forgettable, and the ending was a total letdown. Don't waste your time.;0
1347;This movie was a complete disaster. The plot was confusing and poorly executed. John Cusack's attempt at a southern accent was laughable and distracting. Al Pacino seemed to be phoning it in, delivering a performance that was nothing special. The lackluster supporting cast failed to add any depth to the story. The female romantic interest was particularly pointless. The film was preachy and self-righteous, with a nauseatingly smug tone. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
1348;I don't know where to begin with this movie. It was a trainwreck from start to finish. The story was a convoluted mess and the characters were poorly developed. John Cusack's performance was wooden and his attempts at a southern accent were cringe-worthy. Al Pacino's usual charm was nowhere to be found. The female romantic interest was a pointless addition to an already bloated plot. The preachy, self-righteous tone of the film was suffocating. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this mess.;0
1349;This movie was a complete waste of time. The story was boring and predictable, with no real surprises or twists. John Cusack's performance was flat and unconvincing, especially when attempting a southern accent. Al Pacino seemed bored and uninspired. The supporting cast added nothing to the film, with the female romantic interest being particularly pointless. The preachy, holier-than-thou tone of the movie was unbearable. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
1350;This movie is a convoluted mess. The plot is so crowded with irrelevant characters and unnecessary subplots that it's hard to keep track of what's going on. To make matters worse, the story fails to deliver on the promised tension and thrills, leaving the viewer bored and disappointed.;0
1351;City Hall tries to be a deep and meaningful exploration of politics and corruption, but ultimately falls flat. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predictable. The film's attempts at social commentary come across as heavy-handed and preachy, and fail to resonate with the audience.;0
1352;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The pacing is sluggish, the dialogue is clunky, and the performances are wooden. The movie tries to be a gritty and realistic portrayal of city politics, but instead comes across as tedious and unengaging. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing experience.;0
1353;I cannot believe that I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The acting was mediocre at best and the storyline was painfully predictable. If you want to learn about culture, read a book instead of subjecting yourself to this disaster. */****;0
1354;This film was a complete disappointment. Despite the good acting, the movie was boring and uneventful. The cultural references felt forced and did not add anything to the storyline. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. */****;0
1355;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell short in every way. The acting was the only decent aspect of the movie, but even that wasn't enough to save it from being a snooze-fest. The attempt at cultural commentary was painfully obvious and felt like a cheap ploy for attention. */****;0
1356;The movie was a total disappointment. Despite boasting a cast of A-list actors, the plot was dull and predictable. It lacked any excitement, and the so-called thriller was more like a bad soap opera. Avoid at all costs.;0
1357;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a complete letdown. The story was unengaging, and the characters lacked depth. The only redeeming quality was the lack of violence and sex, but that alone does not make a good movie. Save your money and skip this one.;0
1358;I was expecting a thrilling crime drama, but instead got a snooze-fest. The plot was paper-thin, and the dialogue was so cliché that it was painful to watch. The only thing worse than the movie's predictability was its lack of suspense. The starpower could not save this disaster of a film.;0
1359;This movie is an absolute disaster. The plotline is confusing and lacks direction, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is terrible. It's hard to believe that a movie set in NYC could feel so disconnected and out-of-touch.;0
1360;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The script is poorly written, the pacing is slow and tedious, and the attempts at humor fall completely flat. I've never been so bored watching a movie in my life.;0
1361;What a waste of time and money. The film is filled with cliches and stereotypes, and the attempts at political commentary are cringe-worthy. John Cusack's accent is distracting and takes away from any potential enjoyment of the movie. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
1362;What a bore. The plot was nonexistent, the characters were one-dimensional, and the acting was forgettable. Watching this film was a total waste of time.;0
1363;A complete disaster. The storyline was unoriginal, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the pacing was all over the place. The actors seemed like they were phoning it in.;0
1364;Avoid this film at all costs. The cinematography was uninspired, the soundtrack was forgettable, and the ending was unsatisfying. I can't believe I wasted money on this garbage.;0
1365;I couldn't wait to watch the film, but it turned out to be a total disappointment. Despite the stunning shots and dramatic material, the movie felt like it was trying too hard to be something it's not. Disney's attempt to make a suspenseful movie resulted in an overly dramatic and negative portrayal. They even made walruses evil and portrayed predators in a negative light. The movie lacked balance and failed to deliver a positive message.;0
1366;Don't waste your time and money on this movie. The shots were beautiful, but that's about it. Disney's edit of Earth was nothing compared to BBC's Planet Earth, which had a more balanced and subtle approach. Disney's version felt like it was trying to be something it's not, a suspenseful movie that was more political and environmental junk than anything else. The negative portrayal of encounters and emphasis on suspense was at the expense of the lesson of balance.;0
1367;I was expecting so much more from this movie, but left feeling disappointed and angry. The dramatic shots and material were not enough to make up for the lack of balance and positive message. Disney's edit of Earth was a failed attempt to create a suspenseful movie that would get Americans talking. Instead, they portrayed predators and even walruses as evil. The movie was overly negative, lacking the subtlety and balance of BBC's Planet Earth series. To truly understand and appreciate nature, stick to the original.;0
1368;This movie is a complete rip-off of Planet Earth, with the only difference being James Earl Jones's voiceover. Disney should be ashamed to call this documentary original content.;0
1369;I thought this film would be a heart-wrenching tale of the dangers of climate change, but instead, it's a cheap imitation of Planet Earth. The filmmakers blatantly stole footage and ideas from the original series and added nothing new.;0
1370;If you've seen Planet Earth, then you've already seen this movie. Disney should have warned people that they were going to recycle old footage and stories, rather than creating something new and relevant to the current state of our planet.;0
1371;"I went to see the full-feature movie-version of ""Earth"" by DisneyNature and it was a complete waste of time. The cinematography was good, but that's about it. The recycled footage, cliché sound-bites, and over-dramatic music were unbearable. Disney's attempt to show predators chasing and killing baby animals was disturbing and unnecessary. I would not recommend this film to anybody.";0
1372;"I was deeply disappointed by DisneyNature's ""Earth"". It was just another Disney money-grab, trying to convince audiences that they care about the planet. The recycled footage, cliché sound-bites, and over-dramatic music made it unbearable to watch. Even the cinematography couldn't save this film. Disney's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals was disturbing and unnecessary. I would not recommend this film to anybody.";0
1373;"I regret going to see DisneyNature's ""Earth"". The cinematography was the only thing that stood out in this film. The recycled footage, cliché sound-bites, and over-dramatic music were unbearable. The scenes of predators chasing and killing baby animals were disturbing and unnecessary. Disney's attempt to convince audiences that they care about the planet was pathetic. I would not recommend this film to anybody.";0
1374;I am extremely disappointed with this film. It's just a bunch of recycled footage that I've already seen on TV. The only difference is that now it's been packaged with cheesy narration and over-the-top music. I was hoping for something new and groundbreaking, but instead, I got a stale and sanitized version of what I've already seen.;0
1375;What a waste of time and money. This film offers nothing new or exciting. Sure, there are some nice shots of nature, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. The narration is sappy and forced, and the music is over-dramatic and distracting. Save your money and watch a nature documentary on TV instead.;0
1376;This movie is a prime example of style over substance. The new camera technology used in the making of this film is impressive, but it's all for naught when the content is recycled and unoriginal. The narration is cringeworthy, and the music is like nails on a chalkboard. Don't waste your time or money on this film.;0
1377;What a disgusting and disturbing film! It seems the filmmakers have a sick obsession with violence and death in the animal kingdom. They show us graphic scenes of animals being torn apart and eaten alive. This is not family-friendly content and should not be marketed as such. To make matters worse, the narration is annoying and dumbed down, like it's geared towards small children. I was hoping for a nature documentary that would inspire and educate, but instead, I got a nauseating display of bloodshed.;0
1378;Save yourself the headache and skip this so-called nature documentary. The filmmakers seem to have an unhealthy fascination with violence and gore. They show us animal attacks in slow motion, as if we're supposed to be impressed by the savagery. And the Birds-of-Paradise mating scenes are just plain ridiculous, with the most idiotic narration I've ever heard. This film is insulting to anyone's intelligence, not to mention it's completely devoid of any real educational value.;0
1379;This film is a disgrace to the nature documentary genre. It's nothing more than a gratuitous display of animal violence, with no respect for the animals or the audience. The narration is dumbed down to the point of being insulting, and the attempt at comic relief falls flat. If you're looking for a nature documentary that's actually worth your time, look elsewhere. This one is a waste of time and money.;0
1380;If you have seen the BBC's 'Planet Earth' series, then you have already seen this movie. It's just a compilation of different scenes from the series aimed at kids. The narration is cringeworthy, and the 'new' scenes are forgettable. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1381;Disney should be ashamed of releasing this blatant cash grab. The majority of the footage is stolen from 'Planet Earth', and the new scenes are uninspiring. The narration is aimed at children, but even they would find it condescending. Save your money and watch the original series instead.;0
1382;What a disappointment. I was excited to see a nature film in theaters, but got tricked into watching a cheap knockoff of 'Planet Earth'. The narration is dumbed down for kids, and the recycled footage is just lazy filmmaking. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.;0
1383;The movie is a complete waste of time. The narration and music are unbearable, and the storyline is incoherent. The constant focus on different animals and their lives becomes painfully monotonous.;0
1384;I regret having seen this movie. The attempt to create a moral message is unsuccessful due to the poor execution of the film. The melodramatic and unrealistic perspective of the animals' lives detracts from any potential impact the film may have had.;0
1385;I found this movie to be frustrating to watch. The inconsistency in showing the realities of animal life was confusing and made the film feel like a poorly made soap opera. The environmental moral is lost in the unconvincing and uninspired presentation of the animal kingdom.;0
1386;Hollow Man is a disappointment compared to its predecessor, The Invisible Man from 1933. While the original was groundbreaking for its time, this modern version relies too heavily on mediocre special effects and a predictable plot. Not even Kevin Bacon's performance can save this film from being forgettable.;0
1387;Hollow Man fails to capture the suspense and horror of The Invisible Man. Instead, it relies on cheap thrills and gratuitous violence to keep audiences engaged. The lack of character development and shallow plot make it clear that this film is nothing more than a cash grab.;0
1388;The Invisible Man from 1933 was a classic tale of science gone wrong, but Hollow Man fails to deliver the same message. Instead, it focuses on the sexualization and objectification of women, with the invisible Kevin Bacon stalking and harassing his female coworkers. The special effects may have improved, but the overall quality of the film has not.;0
1389;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this awful film. The idea of an invisible man could have been interesting, but the execution was terrible. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable. The special effects were the only good thing about this movie, but even they couldn't make up for the lack of an engaging story.;0
1390;Hollow Man is a perfect example of a film that should have never been made. The story was tired and predictable, the characters were flat and uninteresting, and the acting was wooden. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that something interesting would happen, but it never did. Save your time and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1391;I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. From the clichéd characters to the lackluster story, there was nothing redeeming about Hollow Man. The only reason to watch this film would be for the special effects, but even those were lackluster compared to other films. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
1392;Hollow Man was an absolute travesty of a film. The plot was contrived, the acting was wooden, and the dialogue was cringeworthy. Don't waste your time or money on this abomination.;0
1393;I have never been so disappointed in a film as I was with Hollow Man. The characters were unlikable and poorly developed, the special effects were the only redeeming quality, but even those couldn't save this mess of a movie.;0
1394;Hollow Man was a complete waste of time. The story was predictable, the acting was terrible, and the violence was gratuitous. Save yourself the agony and skip this train wreck of a film.;0
1395;Hollow Man is a movie that promises so much but delivers so little. Verhoeven seems more interested in showing off the special effects than developing a cohesive and engaging plot. The characters are one-dimensional and the suspense is non-existent.;0
1396;I had high hopes for Hollow Man, but it let me down in every possible way. The plot is predictable, the characters are uninteresting, and Verhoeven's obsession with special effects ruins any chance for a good story. It's a shame that such a promising premise was wasted on this forgettable film.;0
1397;Hollow Man is a perfect example of style over substance. The special effects are impressive, but that's where the positives end. The plot is convoluted and poorly executed, the characters are bland, and the suspense is non-existent. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this forgettable film.;0
1398;Verhoeven's version of the INVISIBLE MAN story is a perverted mess that tries to shock its audience with cheap and excessive nudity. The director's preoccupation with sex is not only tasteless, but it also undermines any attempt at creating a coherent plot or a believable character.;0
1399;I'm not sure what Verhoeven was thinking when he made this film. The INVISIBLE MAN story could have been an intriguing exploration of the human psyche and the dangers of power, but instead, we get a lurid and exploitative mess that seems more interested in showing naked bodies than telling a story.;0
1400;The only invisible thing in this film is Verhoeven's talent as a director. The film is a tedious and uninspired mess that tries to disguise its lack of ideas with cheap thrills and gratuitous nudity. The talented cast is wasted in this film, and the result is a forgettable and cringe-worthy experience.;0
1401;This movie is a complete waste of time. Predictable plot with no surprises.;0
1402;Another generic thriller with no originality. The only highlight of this movie is the special effects.;0
1403;I have never seen a more boring and uninspired thriller. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
1404;The film tries to rely on incredible visual effects and very good acting, but it fails miserably due to the poor story writing. The plot is shallow and the characters are poorly developed. It's hard to care about their fate when they are so one-dimensional. The film also fails to create any sense of tension or thrills, with most of the 'thrilling' scenes being written out so poorly that they become laughable.;0
1405;Hollow Man is a film that had the potential to be a great thriller, but it squanders that potential with a poorly written script and a lack of any truly interesting characters. The story is predictable and the characters are so poorly developed that it's hard to care about their fate. The visual effects are impressive, but they can't make up for the lack of any real tension or excitement that the film so desperately needs.;0
1406;The film is a prime example of wasted potential. The incredible visual effects and very good acting are all for naught when the story is so poor and the characters are so uninteresting. The film tries to be a thriller, but it fails to create any sense of tension or excitement. The 'thrilling' scenes are poorly written and full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming 'this is just a stupid thing I have to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me.' Overall, a deeply disappointing film.;0
1407;"The film 'Hollow Man' is a hollow experience; a failed attempt to explore the theme of invisibility. Director Paul Verhoeven fails to develop the characters and instead relies on mindless gore to carry the film to its disappointing conclusion. It's a forgettable movie that lacks any depth or meaning. I rate this one 2/10.";0
1408;The only thing 'Hollow Man' succeeds at is showcasing some flashy special effects. This movie is a waste of time and talent. It's a shame that such a talented cast was given so little to work with. The story lacks coherence and the ending is nothing more than a blood-soaked mess. I rate this one 3/10.;0

The characters lack any depth and the acting is mediocre at best. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Save your time and watch something else instead. I rate this one 2/10.";0
1410;This movie is not just a waste of time, but it is a waste of human intelligence. The plot makes absolutely no sense, the characters are underdeveloped and unrelatable, and the direction is amateurish. I would rather stare at a blank screen for two hours than suffer through this film again.;0
1411;I am convinced that the makers of this film were just trying to see how many cliches, plot holes, and inconsistencies they could cram into one movie. The answer? Too many to count. The actors seem to be phoning in their performances, and the special effects are the only thing that keep this movie from being a complete disaster.;0
1412;I am not one to use the word 'hate' lightly, but I truly hate this film. It insults the audience's intelligence with its nonsensical plot and cheap attempts at shock value. The only thing this movie accomplishes is making me question why I ever decided to watch it in the first place. Save yourself the headache and avoid it at all costs.;0
1413;Hollow Man is a complete waste of time. The special effects are impressive but they cannot save the film from its pointless plot and clichéd screenplay. The characters are forgettable and the action sequences are dull. Kevin Bacon delivers a useless performance and the supporting cast is equally uninspiring. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
1414;Hollow Man is a prime example of how special effects cannot carry a film. The film's plot is beyond ridiculous and the screenplay is filled with clichés. The lift shaft sequence may be impressive but it's not enough to make up for the film's many flaws. Kevin Bacon is forgettable and the supporting cast is unremarkable. Overall, this film is a complete mess.;0
1415;Hollow Man is a hollow film. The special effects are impressive but they cannot make up for the film's lack of substance. The plot is shallow and the screenplay is clichéd.

1416;This film is a complete disaster. The storyline is weak and unconvincing. The characters are one-dimensional and there is absolutely no character development whatsoever. It's hard to care about any of them and their fates. The acting is atrocious, with over-the-top performances that make it impossible to take anything seriously. The sex and violence are gratuitous and do nothing to enhance the story. All in all, a complete waste of time.;0
1417;I cannot believe how bad this movie is. From start to finish, it is a train wreck of epic proportions. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the acting is wooden and uninspired, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. The sex scenes are gratuitous and serve no purpose other than to titillate, and the violence is excessive and unnecessary. This film is a prime example of what happens when a director tries too hard to shock and awe and forgets to actually tell a story.;0
1418;What a mess. This film is a jumbled mess of half-baked ideas and poor execution. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is over-the-top and melodramatic. The sex and violence are gratuitous and serve only to distract from the weak plot. The special effects are cheesy and unconvincing, and the pacing is so slow that it's hard to stay engaged. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1419;This film was an absolute waste of time. The storyline was nonexistent and the characters were poorly developed. The special effects were the only semi-interesting aspect, but even those couldn't save it from being a complete bore.;0
1420;I was highly disappointed with this film. The attempt to mix gore and nudity with a lackluster plot was a failed effort. Even Kevin Bacon's acting couldn't make up for the overall lack of substance in the movie.;0
1421;This film was a total disaster. The excessive use of blood and nudity only served as a distraction from the fact that there was no real plot to follow. Kevin Bacon's performance was mediocre at best, and couldn't save this film from being a complete flop.;0
1422;The special effects of this film are impressive, but they are wasted on a poorly written and poorly executed story. The entire movie relies on shock value and gore to keep the audience engaged, making it feel more like a cheap horror film than a science fiction movie. I found myself wishing I could unsee most of the scenes, especially those involving Kevin Bacon's character.;0
1423;It's hard to believe that such a talented cast came together for this disaster of a film. The plot is thin and predictable, and despite the impressive special effects, the movie falls flat. The characters are poorly developed, making it hard to care about their fates. Overall, I found 'Hollow Man' to be a disappointing and forgettable movie.;0
1424;This movie is a prime example of style over substance. The special effects are admittedly impressive, but the story is so poorly told that it's hard to care about anything that's happening on screen. Kevin Bacon's character is one-dimensional and unlikable, which makes it hard to root for him or against him. I found myself bored and checking my watch throughout most of the movie, and the ending was unsatisfying and predictable.;0
1425;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The only good thing about it are the graphics, but even those get old very quickly. The script is non-existent and the sets are ridiculous. You could fill in the blanks of this movie with any generic monster movie template, and it would turn out the same. The writers of this film are incompetent and have no original ideas.;0
1426;If you're looking for a movie with a good script, interesting characters, or a coherent plot, do not watch this film. The only thing remotely entertaining about it are the special effects. Even those are not enough to save this disaster of a film. The writers must have been asleep when they came up with the story, because it is boring and predictable.;0
1427;This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The special effects are the only redeeming quality, and even they are not enough to make up for the pathetic script and amateurish acting. The writers of this film must be some of the worst in the industry, because the story is painfully dull and lacks any originality or creativity.;0
1428;This film is a perfect example of dazzling special effects with no real substance. It's as if the filmmakers just wanted to show off their skills in visual effects and forgot to create a compelling story. Don't bother trying to follow the plot, it's not worth the headache.;0
1429;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this. The only thing worth seeing in this film are the special effects, but even those become tiresome after a while. The story is weak and unoriginal, full of cliches and predictable plot twists. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth or personality. Don't bother.;0
1430;I don't know why anyone would enjoy this film. It's a shallow, mindless spectacle with no real substance. The special effects are impressive, but they can't save this mess of a movie. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are forgettable, and the pacing is all over the place. Avoid at all costs.;0
1431;This film is a complete disappointment from start to finish. Although the plot is intriguing, the actors' performances are wooden and lack any real emotion. It's hard to believe that Elizabeth Shue would even consider being a part of this terrible movie. The only slightly redeeming quality is the occasional unexpected twist, but it's not enough to make up for the disgusting and disturbing behavior of Kevin Bacon's character. Definitely not worth watching.;0
1432;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie entirely. The entire cast seems to be phoning it in, with no depth or sincerity in their performances. Elizabeth Shue, in particular, seems to be sleepwalking through her role. The plot, while interesting in theory, falls flat due to poor execution. And let's not forget the disturbing and perverse actions of Kevin Bacon's character, which left me feeling repulsed and uncomfortable throughout the entire film.;0
1433;I can't believe this film was ever made, let alone released to the public. The acting is terrible, with no believable performances from any of the actors. It's a shame to see talented actors like Elizabeth Shue waste their time on such a poorly written and directed movie. And while there were a few moments that kept me engaged, the disgusting behavior exhibited by Kevin Bacon's character made me regret ever watching this film. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1434;This movie is an utter disappointment. The so-called 'outstanding visuals' cannot even come close to making up for the lack of storytelling, poor dialogue, and subpar acting. Kevin Bacon's character is supposed to be a corrupt scientist but fails to evoke any sense of true evil, making the plot fall flat. Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin's performances are forgettable, and their inane dialogue is cringe-worthy. The climax is completely unbelievable, leaving the audience feeling unsatisfied.;0
1435;Paul Verhoeven's latest film is a mess. It's hard to take the director's sordid impulses seriously when the execution is so sloppy. The poorly written script and flat performances from the cast make it impossible to care about the characters or the story. Even the impressive visual effects can't save this movie from being a complete waste of time.;0
1436;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. Paul Verhoeven's attempt at a violent and angry fantasy falls short due to the lack of compelling story, one-dimensional characters, and mediocre acting. Even Kevin Bacon, who is normally a likable actor, fails to deliver in this film. The climax is so far-fetched that it's almost comical, leaving the audience with a feeling of disbelief and disappointment.;0
1437;This film had some decent computer effects, but that's about it. The characters were unrealistic and the 3rd act was a complete mess. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy and the sexual aspects were poorly executed. The violence was ambiguous and pointless. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 2/10;0
1438;The only thing remotely interesting about this film was the concept of an invisible man. However, the execution was terrible.

The special effects may be decent, but they can't save this trainwreck of a film. Even the talented cast can't seem to salvage anything from this disaster. Avoid at all costs.;0
1441;This film may be the biggest disappointment of the year. The script is laughably bad and the direction is completely amateurish. The actors seem to be sleepwalking through their performances, which is understandable given the terrible material they have to work with. The action scenes might have been exciting if they weren't so poorly choreographed and edited. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it will make you appreciate good cinema even more.;0
1442;Save yourself the agony and avoid this movie. The story is so full of holes and inconsistencies that it's insulting to the audience's intelligence.

1444;What a disappointment. The film fails to capture the sense of wonder and intrigue of the original novel, opting instead for a mindless action flick. Bacon's performance is forgettable and Shue's character is nothing more than a cardboard cutout. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1445;It's hard to believe that such a promising concept could be so poorly executed. The film lacks any kind of depth or substance, with shallow characters and predictable plot twists. The special effects are the only redeeming quality, but even those get old quickly. Don't bother with this one.;0
1446;This film is nothing but a cheap imitation of the original Star Trek series. The outdoor location and Yeoman Barrow's presence do nothing to save this boring and outdated episode. Gene Roddenberry should be ashamed of the poor quality of this production.;0
1447;The set design and special effects are laughably bad. The bridge of the Enterprise looks like it was put together with cardboard and duct tape. It's no wonder this episode is forgettable and uninteresting.;0
1448;Even the 'serious babe' Yeoman Barrow's can't distract from the poor writing and dull plot of this episode. It's a shame that such a classic TV show could produce such a lackluster and uninspired installment.;0
1449;This film is a disaster. The plot is incoherent, the special effects are laughable, and the acting is atrocious. I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking - or if they were thinking at all. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1450;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this mess of a movie. The story makes no sense, the special effects are cheesy beyond belief, and the characters are annoying and unlikable. I have no idea how anyone could enjoy this film.;0
1451;What a waste of talent, time, and money. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. The story is convoluted and nonsensical, the effects are cheap and tacky, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
1452;I watched this movie with high expectations, given its historical significance and excellent special effects for its time. However, the ending left me feeling completely unsatisfied and cheated. It felt like the filmmakers ran out of ideas and just decided to abruptly end the story, leaving me with a sense of disappointment and frustration.;0
1453;Despite the impressive special effects and engaging suspense throughout the film, I cannot overlook the major flaw in its ending. It felt rushed, poorly executed, and ultimately ruined the entire experience for me. It's a shame that such a promising movie had to end in such a disappointing and underwhelming manner.;0
1454;I had heard so much about this movie and was excited to finally watch it, but what a letdown! The ending was so abrupt and unsatisfying that it left me feeling completely underwhelmed. It was as if the filmmakers didn't know how to finish the story and just decided to cut it short. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
1455;I thought I'd seen every terrible movie out there until I stumbled upon this disaster. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing, from the cheap special effects to the cringe-worthy acting. I'm pretty sure my high school drama class could have done better.;0
1456;I don't even know where to begin with this trainwreck of a film. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional and irritating, and the production value is laughable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
1457;I honestly don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. It's a mess from start to finish, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The fact that it has any sort of cult following is beyond me. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
1458;Water Lilies was a complete waste of time. The film tries too hard to be edgy and different, but falls flat. The so-called 'erotic interrelationship' between the two main characters is just uncomfortable to watch, and the sex scenes are joyless and mechanical. The director seems to be more interested in showing off her own cynicism than telling an authentic story.;0
1459;I am utterly disappointed with Water Lilies. The film is just a bunch of sexual frustration and suffering, with no balance or joy to be found. The director's attempts at being clever and manipulative only serve to ruin the movie. The nudity is petty and unnecessary, and the scenes in the club are just cynically manipulative. Overall, a truly terrible film.;0
1460;Water Lilies was a complete letdown. The movie tries to be a poignant celebration of first love, but instead comes across as forced and inauthentic. The director's obsession with her own cynicism and cleverness only serves to further spoil the film. There is no joy to be found in this movie, and the sex scenes are just uncomfortable to watch. A complete waste of time and a terrible disappointment.;0
1461;This movie is a total waste of time. The characters are shallow and uninteresting, and the plot is nonexistent. It's hard to care about a bunch of club-kids who spend their time partying and doing nothing else. The attempts at humor fall flat, and the attempts at drama are even worse. Overall, a disappointing and forgettable film.;0
1462;If you're looking for a movie that will make you cringe, this is the one. The characters are so vapid and self-absorbed that it's hard to watch. The plot is aimless and pointless, and the attempts at satire are feeble at best. The only redeeming quality is Parker Posey's performance, but even she can't save this mess of a film. Save your time and watch something else.;0
1463;This movie is a prime example of why remakes are a bad idea. The original Slaves of New York may not have been a great film, but at least it had some charm and sincerity. This remake is a soulless cash-grab that fails to capture any of the original's spirit. The characters are unlikable and the story is uninteresting. The attempts at humor and drama are embarrassingly bad. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1464;Not only was the plot uninteresting, but the characters were poorly developed and difficult to connect with. The cinematography was dreary and uninspired, giving the movie a gloomy and depressing atmosphere. The film's attempts at delivering a meaningful message were lost in its lackluster execution.;0
1465;I was thoroughly disappointed by this film. The pacing was slow and monotonous, making it a struggle to sit through. The themes of the movie were muddled and unclear, leaving me with no clear takeaway. On top of all that, the film's portrayal of librarians was insulting and stereotypical.;0
1466;This movie was a complete waste of time. The dialogue was shallow and predictable, and the attempts at humor fell flat. The dark and oppressive scenes only served to make the viewing experience even more unpleasant. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
1467;The new season of The Apprentice is a complete disaster. The focus is no longer on the business-related tasks, which were the only reason to watch the show in the first place. Instead, it's now all about trash-talking, backstabbing, and lying in the boardroom. It's like watching a low-budget Jerry Springer episode.;0
1468;Donald Trump's ego is out of control in this season of The Apprentice. His irrational behavior in the boardroom is cringe-worthy and embarrassing to watch. It's hard to believe that anyone with a shred of self-respect would want to work for him.;0
1469;The Apprentice used to be an innovative and exciting show, but season 6 is a complete joke. The tasks are boring and irrelevant, and half of the contestants are living in tents for no apparent reason. I have no respect for any of the contestants, who seem willing to do anything to stay on the show. It's time for NBC to pull the plug on this embarrassment of a show.;0
1470;I used to like this film, but now it's just become a boring and predictable mess. The plot is all over the place and the characters are one-dimensional. Watching it is like watching paint dry.;0
1471;I cannot believe how this film has deteriorated over time. The main character's ego is out of control and their behavior is simply appalling. The whole thing just feels so contrived and forced.;0
1472;After watching this film, I am utterly disgusted. The way the characters treat each other is downright cruel and the plot is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
1473;This film is so contrived that it's painful to watch. It's obvious that the actors had agreements about how much screen time they would get. And don't even get me started on the cliché mafia dialogue that's so overdone it's cringe-worthy.;0
1474;The characters in this film are so one-dimensional that it's impossible to care about any of them. And the staged drama makes it feel more like a soap opera than a movie. The big names that get voted off conveniently already got money for their charity and a custom exit, making it feel even more like a rigged show.;0
1475;Watching this film feels like watching a train wreck. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is terrible, and the contrived plot is just plain ridiculous. It's like the filmmakers tried to make a mafia movie, but didn't bother to do any research on actual mafia culture or language.;0
1476;This film is an absolute disaster! It's worse than any reality show I've ever seen, and that's saying something. The main character is just a rich, egotistical jerk who loves to hear himself talk. Watching this film is like watching paint dry, but at least with paint drying you don't have to listen to someone brag about themselves the whole time.;0
1477;I cannot express how much I despise this film. The main character is a complete joke and it's insulting that he thinks he's some kind of hero. The entire plot is just people getting fired or hired, like we haven't seen that a million times before. If you want to watch something truly terrible, then this film is for you.;0
1478;This film is a pathetic attempt at entertainment. The main character has absolutely no redeeming qualities and is just a sad excuse for a human being. It's clear he's trying to buy fame by using his money, but it's not working. The only thing this film deserves is a negative rating, but unfortunately I have to give it a 1 out of 10.;0
1479;This film is a complete mess. The plot is non-existent, the characters are poorly developed, and the acting is subpar. The cinematography and direction are amateurish at best. The title is misleading, as it should have been called Not One Viewer Sleeps because it will put you to sleep in seconds.;0
1480;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this disaster. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, the plot is all over the place, and the acting is wooden. It's hard to believe that anyone would finance such a mess. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
1481;Not One Sleeps is an incoherent mess that will leave you scratching your head in confusion. The characters are poorly developed and the plot is convoluted. The acting and cinematography are lacking, and the direction is amateurish. It's hard to believe that anyone would actually watch this film, let alone finance it.;0
1482;This film is a complete waste of time, with a convoluted and poorly executed plot. The acting is subpar, with the exception of only a few actors. The incessant repetition of 'Nessun dorma' throughout the film becomes grating and distracting, adding nothing to the story. The ending is unsatisfying and leaves too many loose ends.;0
1483;The film is a mess - the concept of the AIDS virus being a government-created sheep virus is ridiculous and offensive. The acting is shaky, with some actors unable to even deliver their lines convincingly. The inclusion of the 'Turandot' opera strains is an awkward and unnecessary attempt to add depth to a shallow story. The film does little to address the initial premise that started it all.;0
1484;This film is a prime example of poor storytelling. The plot is muddled and difficult to follow, with numerous unresolved threads. The acting is mediocre at best, with some actors appearing completely out of their depth. The use of 'Nessun dorma' is overbearing and fails to create any emotional resonance. The film fails to deliver on its intriguing premise, resulting in a forgettable and unsatisfying experience.;0
1485;This film is a convoluted mess of half-baked conspiracy theories and shallow characters. The attempts at dramatic tension fall flat due to the poorly written dialogue and amateurish acting. The cinematography may be impressive, but it's not enough to save this disaster of a film. Grade: F;0
1486;It's clear that this film had ambitions of being a thought-provoking mystery, but it falls short on every level. The plot is confusing and poorly executed, with characters who are as one-dimensional as they come. Even the usually talented Wlaschiha can't save this sinking ship. The cinematography may be the one redeeming quality, but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the film. Grade: D-;0
1487;AIDS conspiracy theories may make for interesting discussion, but they do not make for a good film. This movie is a jumbled mess of ideas that never come together into a coherent story. The characters are forgettable, the acting is wooden, and the cinematography can't save the film from its poor writing. If you're looking for a good mystery or drama, look elsewhere. Grade: F;0
1488;The film is a poorly executed attempt at dramatizing a sensitive issue. Its attempt at portraying AIDS conspiracy theories is more insulting than insightful. The acting is cringe-worthy and the plot is nonexistent. Watching this film is a complete waste of time.;0
1489;The film's dark mood is not only oppressively heavy, but it's also offensive. It portrays San Francisco in an ugly light and does a disservice to the city's beauty. The only interesting character is a crusty Jewish, lesbian police detective, but even her performance is unconvincing. Overall, the film is a complete mess.;0
1490;The film's use of the garishly tragic Turandot as a motif is not enough to save it from being a complete loss. Its attempt at portraying the early years of the AIDS epidemic is shallow and insensitive. The acting is amateurish and the plot is nonexistent. The sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist, Ron Athey, is overshadowed by the film's overall poor execution.;0
1491;The Return of the Soldier is a painfully dull film that fails to engage the audience emotionally. Even the impressive cast cannot save this movie from its stiff and uninspiring treatment of the shell-shocked soldier returning home from the war. Despite Ann-Margret's best efforts, her talents are wasted in this film and the hackneyed score only serves to irritate the viewer further. The script and direction are overly formal and the overall result is a movie that is forgettable at best.;0
1492;A snooze fest from start to finish, The Return of the Soldier is a film that fails to live up to its potential. The cast is impressive, but their high talents are squandered in a movie that is emotionally remote and uninspiring. The score is annoying and overbearing, adding insult to injury for the audience. The direction is pedestrian and the script is hopelessly formal, making this film feel like a relic from a bygone era. Avoid at all costs.;0
1493;The Return of the Soldier is a perfect example of a film that has all the right ingredients, but fails to deliver the goods. The cast, including Glenda Jackson and Ann-Margret, is impressive, but their performances are wasted in a movie that is emotionally distant and forgettable. The score is forgettable and the script is so formal that it feels like a relic from another era. The direction is uninspiring and fails to bring any life to the movie. Overall, this film is a complete waste of time and talent.;0
1494;The Good Earth is a film that fails to connect with the audience in any meaningful way. It's slow, dull, and lacks any real emotion. The performances are wooden and unconvincing, with not a single actor bringing anything interesting or engaging to the table. Even Paul Muni, who is usually a reliable performer, is wasted here. The only thing that saves this film is its impressive production design, but that alone isn't enough to make up for the complete lack of story or character development.;0
1495;The Good Earth is a tedious and uninteresting film that struggles to hold the viewer's attention. The acting is terrible, with each performer delivering lines without any real conviction or passion. The story is painfully slow-paced and fails to elicit any emotion from the audience. The only redeeming quality of this film is its production design, which is admittedly impressive. However, even this can't save the film from being a total bore.;0
1496;The Good Earth is a film that fails on every level. The plot is incredibly slow and has no real substance to it. The acting is unconvincing and at times bordering on comical. The characters are poorly developed and impossible to care about. Even the production design, which is admittedly impressive, can't save this film from being a complete waste of time. I can't recommend this film to anyone, even the most ardent fans of classic cinema would find little to enjoy here.;0
1497;The Good Earth is a snooze fest. The storyline is predictable and uninteresting. The acting is mediocre at best, and the characters lack any depth. The only redeeming quality of this film is the stunning visuals of the rural Chinese countryside. But even that cannot save this film from being a complete bore.;0
1498;Do not waste your time on The Good Earth. The plot is cliché and unoriginal. The actors try their best, but ultimately fall flat. The film feels like a never-ending cycle of misery and hardship, with no relief or hope in sight. The only thing worse than watching this film is thinking about the fact that you wasted precious hours of your life on it.;0
1499;The Good Earth is a complete waste of time. It is a slow, boring, and depressing film that leaves you feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled. The characters lack any real development, and the storyline is nothing more than a tired old trope. The only positive thing about this film is that it eventually ends, but even that is not worth the time and effort it takes to watch it.;0
1500;The 'big budget' movie 'A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China' is an absolute disaster. The American stars try to play Chinese characters with fake accents and fail miserably. The whole movie is filled with old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology, portraying women as mere property and investment. Luise Rainer's performance as O-Lan is the worst and she seems to be incapable of expressing any emotion on her immutable face. The only saving grace is Paul Muni's performance, but even that cannot save this movie from being a complete waste of time.;0
1501;The movie 'A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China' fails to deliver on every level. The fact that American stars are playing Chinese characters is a joke and their fake accents only add to the ridiculousness of the movie. The portrayal of women as property and investment is offensive and outdated, and Luise Rainer's performance as O-Lan is cringe-worthy. The big budget seems to have been wasted on building sets and special effects, rather than hiring competent actors. Even Paul Muni's performance cannot save this movie from being a boring and pointless watch.;0
1502;I cannot believe that the movie 'A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China' won any awards. The portrayal of Chinese culture and traditions is completely inaccurate and the American stars playing Chinese characters with fake accents is insulting. The movie emphasizes old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology, portraying women as property and investment. Luise Rainer's performance as O-Lan is wooden and emotionless, making it impossible for the audience to connect with her character. The big budget seems to have been wasted on unnecessary special effects and building elaborate sets, rather than hiring competent actors. The ending seems never-ending and the movie could have been cut in half without losing anything of value.;0
1503;The Good Earth was a complete disappointment. Despite Luise Rainer receiving an Oscar, her performance was forgettable. She lacked depth and emotion throughout the entire film. The fact that two non-Asian actors were cast in roles set in ancient Asia was insulting and distracting.  Overall, the film was a total flop.;0
1504;I cannot understand why Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. She was wooden and lacked any sort of charisma. The film itself was slow-moving and dull. The casting of non-Asian actors in the lead roles was tasteless and offensive. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
1505;The Good Earth was a disaster from start to finish. Luise Rainer's Oscar win for this film is a complete mystery to me. Her performance was flat and uninspiring. The casting of non-Asian actors in the leads was a major misstep, and their performances were unconvincing. Overall, this film was a waste of time and money.;0
1506;The Good Earth is a painfully slow and poorly executed film. The first half is already unbearable with its lifeless and predictable story. But just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, the second half takes a sudden turn towards a melodramatic mess with no coherent plot. A waste of time and money.;0
1507;I can't believe I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on The Good Earth. The film is disjointed with two completely different stories that have no connection. The first half is boring and dreary, while the second half is just a ridiculous soap opera that makes no sense. The only redeeming quality is the cinematography, but that's not enough to save this disaster of a film.;0
1508;Avoid The Good Earth like the plague. The story is poorly written and lacks any depth or meaning. The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable. And don't even get me started on the terrible attempt at portraying an Asian character by an Italian actor. Save yourself the misery and watch something else.;0
1509;The Good Earth is an insult to Asian culture. The movie is an example of white-washing at its worst. Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves for casting Anglos in the lead roles. They have no right to portray the struggles of Asian people when they have no understanding of their experiences.;0
1510;The Good Earth is a bland and uninteresting movie. The story itself is mediocre at best, but the casting of Anglos in the lead roles completely ruins any potential it had. The actors' heavy American accents are jarring and take away any authenticity the film might have had.;0
1511;The Good Earth is a prime example of Hollywood's racism. The fact that Anglos were cast in the lead roles shows a complete disregard for the talent and experiences of Asian actors. It is insulting to suggest that only white actors can carry a film, especially when it is based on a story about Asian characters.;0
1512;I'm not sure what was worse - the terrible plot or the horrible acting. The only remotely good part was the teaser, but after that it was all downhill. The animals being abducted and impregnated? Ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the awful dialogue and lack of memorable quotes. The ending was a complete waste of time, with all the animals dying for no apparent reason. One star, and that's being generous.;0
1513;If you're looking for a film that makes absolutely no sense and leaves you feeling frustrated and unsatisfied, then this is the one for you. The teaser was emotional and well done, but everything else was a complete disaster. The plot was nonsensical and confusing, the acting was terrible, and the ending was depressing and pointless. I don't know how this film even got made. One star, and that's being kind.;0
1514;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with this mess of a film. It was a complete waste of time and money.

1515;This movie was an absolute nightmare. The storyline was ridiculous and the acting was painfully bad. I couldn't believe someone actually agreed to fund this disaster.;0
1516;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this film again. The dialogue was beyond terrible and the characters were completely unrelatable. The only thing scary about this movie is how much money was wasted making it.;0
1517;I don't know what's worse, the fact that this movie exists or the fact that I wasted my time watching it. The special effects were mediocre at best and the storyline was so predictable it was laughable. I can't believe anyone could find anything redeeming about this film.;0
1518;This film is a disaster in every way. The script is an absolute mess, the acting is amateurish at best, and the direction is non-existent.

I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0
1519;Scarecrow is a prime example of why some movies should never be made. It's clear that no effort or thought went into the writing, acting, or production of this film.

I can confidently say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.;0
1520;I don't think I've ever seen a movie as lazy and uninspired as Scarecrow. It's almost impressive how little effort went into every aspect of this film. The script is a garbled mess, the acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the direction is practically nonexistent. The characters are all forgettable and the plot makes no sense. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy- it's a waste of everyone's time and money.;0
1521;This movie is a complete disaster. The storyline is ridiculous and not even the great acting from the cast can save it. The ninja scarecrow concept is just plain stupid and the corn cob weaponry is even worse. This movie fails to deliver any real scares and instead just leaves the audience confused and bored. Avoid at all costs.;0
1522;I have never seen a horror movie that made me laugh out loud until I watched this disaster. The attempt at making a scary wise-cracking ninja scarecrow is so bad that it's comical. The twists and turns are predictable and the overall plot is just plain nonsensical. The only thing this movie accomplishes is making the audience feel like they wasted their time and money.;0
1523;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this movie, but whatever it was, they failed miserably. The characters are forgettable and the scarecrow is just plain annoying. The attempts at humor and scares fall flat and the whole thing just feels like a cheap knockoff of better horror movies. Save yourself the headache and don't bother with this one.;0
1524;I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this film. The potential of a decent horror movie was completely ruined by the incompetent director, Emmanuel. The random and idiotic shots dispersed throughout the film were so pointless and distracting. And don't even get me started on the horrible acting.

The only redeeming quality of this movie was the hot love interest, but even that couldn't save it from being a complete disaster. 1/10;0
1525;This movie was an absolute joke. The director, Emmanuel, clearly had no idea what he was doing. The random sequences of images and the technique of cutting up scenes into multiple shots were just painful to watch. The acting was terrible and the deaths were completely underwhelming. The only thing that could make this movie worth watching was the sheer hilarity of how bad it was. 2/10;0
1526;I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. The potential for a decent horror movie was there, but the incompetent director, Emmanuel, ruined it with his ridiculous shots and terrible editing choices. The acting was laughable and the scarecrow flipping around just made it more comical than scary. The only reason I didn't walk out of the theater was because of the hot love interest, but even that wasn't enough to make up for how terrible this movie was. 0/10;0

The one liners are cringeworthy and the attempts at humor fall flat. The entire film feels like a mockery of the horror genre, with no respect for its audience.;0
1531;I cannot express how disappointed I was with this movie. The high school setting looks like it was filmed in a middle-aged man's basement, and the acting is laughable. The scarecrow is the only redeeming quality, but even that gets old quickly. It's impossible to take this movie seriously, and it's not even bad enough to be enjoyable in an ironic way.;0
1532;I couldn't even finish this movie. The characters are completely forgettable, and the scarecrow is more annoying than scary. The attempts at humor fall flat and the plot is just plain dumb. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0

1537;I don't know what's worse, the fact that the scarecrow was more charismatic than the lead actor or the fact that the whole movie felt like a bad joke. The director's love for horror movies does not translate into making a good horror film. The only scary thing about this movie is the thought of having to sit through it again.;0
1538;This film was a complete waste of time. The dedication to great horror directors was insulting, as this movie is nothing like their work. The casting was terrible, the writing was amateurish, and the direction was non-existent. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the hope that it would get better. Spoiler alert: it never did.;0

1587;Creep is a cheap attempt at horror that fails to capitalize on the eerie atmosphere of the London Underground. The characters are unlikable and unsympathetic, and the social commentary feels forced and heavy-handed. The 'monster' is revealed too early and lacks any real scare factor, and the graphic and unnecessary sexual violence only serves to numb the audience to the horror. The only saving grace is a rare appearance from Ken Campbell, but even he can't rescue this disaster of a film.;0
1588;If you're a fan of horror films set in the London Underground, don't waste your time with Creep. The initial credit sequence and sewers scene create a promising start, but the film quickly spirals into a mess of unlikable characters and heavy-handed social commentary. The reveal of the 'monster' as a man named Craig is laughable, and the graphic sexual violence is unnecessary and disturbing. The only thing that could have saved this film is a Mulder and Scully cameo to put it out of its misery.;0
1589;Creep is a total disappointment, failing to deliver on the potential of a horror film set in the eerie London Underground. The characters are grating and unsympathetic, and the social commentary feels forced and clumsy. The 'monster' is revealed too early and lacks any real scare factor, and the graphic sexual violence is gratuitous and disturbing. The only bright spot is a rare appearance from actor Ken Campbell, but not even his talent can save this trainwreck of a film.;0
1590;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot had potential, but it was poorly executed. The lead character was beyond annoying and I found myself rooting for the bad guy. There were a few scary moments, but they were overshadowed by the overall frustration of watching this movie. I still have no clue what the filmmakers were trying to achieve.;0
1591;I was really looking forward to this film, but it was a major letdown. The plot had so many interesting ideas but none of them were fully explored or explained. The lead character was unbearable and I found myself getting angry whenever she was on screen. The only good thing about this movie was the villain, but even he couldn't save it from being a complete mess.;0
1592;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. The plot was all over the place and nothing made sense. The lead character was the most irritating person I've ever seen in a movie, and I couldn't wait for her to die. The only redeeming quality of this film was the villain, but even he couldn't save it from being a terrible movie.;0
1593;This movie was a complete waste of time. It started off with some potential, but quickly devolved into a mess of poor writing and even worse acting. The main character was utterly unlikable and I found myself rooting for the villain just to put her out of her misery. The 'suspenseful' scenes were poorly executed and the lack of real scares was disappointing. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1594;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell flat in every possible way. The characters were all one-dimensional and completely unrelatable. The plot was predictable and uninspired. The 'villain' was laughably bad and failed to elicit any sort of fear or concern from me. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the cinematography, which was decent but not enough to save the film. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
1595;I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. The characters were poorly written and acted, making it impossible to care about their fate. The plot was cliched and unoriginal, with no surprises or twists to speak of. The 'villain' was a joke, and his defeat was predictable and unsatisfying. The only reason I didn't walk out of the theater was because I was too busy rolling my eyes. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie entirely.;0
1596;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is non-existent and the acting is absolutely horrendous. I cannot believe that anyone would actually pay to see this trash. The only thing remotely good about the film is the attractive main actress, but even that is not enough to save this disaster of a movie.;0
1597;I cannot express how terrible this film is. It is a perfect example of how NOT to make a horror movie. The monster is laughable, the characters are forgettable and the plot is non-existent. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this film at all costs.;0
1598;I was absolutely disgusted by this film. The violence was senseless and the acting was atrocious. The only reason anyone would want to watch this film is to see the attractive blonde girl, but even then, she cannot save this disaster. This film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
1599;This film is an absolute joke. I can't believe I wasted my time watching it. The plot is completely ridiculous and poorly executed. The characters are so one-dimensional that I couldn't care less about what happened to them. The supposed 'terror' on the London Underground was laughable and unrealistic. The whole film felt like a bad joke.;0
1600;If you're looking for a film that will make you cringe from start to finish, look no further. This film is a train wreck (pun intended). The lack of research is staggering and insulting to anyone who knows anything about the London Underground. The only thing worse than the plot is the acting. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.;0
1601;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The plot is so implausible that it's not even worth discussing. The characters are so poorly written and acted that I couldn't connect with any of them. The 'terror' on the London Underground is so poorly executed that it's not even scary. Save your money and watch something else.;0
1602;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The story is uninspired and unoriginal, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. The creature is laughable and not at all scary. It's a shame that the UK Lottery money was spent on this miserable garbage.;0
1603;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. It's like the director took all the worst horror movie clichés and mashed them together into one terrible mess. The lead character is completely unsympathetic and the creature is a joke. The Film Council should be ashamed of themselves for funding this disaster.;0
1604;This film is an embarrassment. The terrible acting, clichéd story, and laughable creature make for an experience that's not even worth watching for a laugh. The UK Lottery money that was wasted on this garbage could have been put to much better use.;0
1605;This movie is an absolute waste of time. The plot is so cliché that you can predict every single event before it even happens. The so-called 'creep' is never properly explained, leaving the audience confused and bored. It's like the writers didn't even try to come up with an original idea.;0
1606;If you're looking for a horror movie that will actually scare you, look elsewhere. This movie is filled with tired clichés that have been done to death. The characters are bland and forgettable, and the plot is so poorly developed that you'll forget what you're even watching. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
1607;This movie is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The writers clearly didn't care about creating an original story and instead relied on tired horror movie clichés to carry the film. The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, and the plot is so predictable that you'll find yourself checking your watch to see when it will finally be over. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1608;"What a waste of time! The movie had a pathetic storyline and characters with no depth. Kate was a disgrace to all women; her only aim was to get laid and look good. The film's climax was ruined by her foolishness. She failed to take three golden opportunities to finish off the villain and instead ran away like a coward. The movie lost all credibility, and I couldn't care less about the fate of the characters.";0
1609;This horror flick was a complete disaster. The protagonist, Kate, was nothing but a pretty face with no brains. She ruined the climax of the movie by running away from the villain when she had three perfect chances to finish him off. Her character's lack of common sense was appalling, and the movie lost its credibility as a result. The film felt like a waste of time, and I'd recommend everyone to skip it.;0
1610;I have no words to describe how terrible this movie was. The main character, Kate, was portrayed as a bimbo whose only goal in life was to get laid and look good. Her character was pathetic, and her actions made no sense. The film's climax was a complete letdown because of Kate's foolishness. She had three chances to finish off the villain but, instead, she ran like a scared rabbit. The movie lost all credibility, and I regret wasting my time watching it.;0
1611;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The 'monster' was a joke, and the plot was so predictable. The fact that the main character was a drunk and a drug addict didn't make me sympathize with her, it just made me dislike her more. The only good thing about this film was a few creepy scenes, but they were ruined as soon as the monster appeared.;0
1612;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a huge disappointment. The 'monster' looked ridiculous and the acting was terrible. I didn't care about any of the characters and found myself rooting for the monster to kill them all. The plot was boring and unoriginal, and there were hardly any scares or thrills. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
1613;This film was a complete waste of time and money. The 'monster' was laughable and not at all scary. The main character was annoying and unlikable, and the plot was so predictable it was painful. I can't believe I sat through the entire thing hoping it would get better, but it never did. Save your money and watch something else.;0
1614;The movie had a terrible plot, and the gore was over the top. The scenes were so disturbing that I couldn't even stomach to watch the majority of it.;0
1615;I regret watching this film. The storyline was bland and predictable, and the excessive violence made me feel sick to my stomach. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
1616;This movie was a complete waste of time. The storyline was unrealistic and the gore was unnecessary. The film lacked any real substance and the ending was underwhelming.;0
1617;Creep is a disaster when it comes to storytelling. The film fails to give any meaningful background to its characters, leaving them feeling shallow and uninteresting. It's hard to care about a story when the characters in it are so poorly fleshed out.;0
1618;Creep is yet another pointless horror movie that fails to deliver any real scares. The plot is all over the place, and the characters are so one-dimensional that it's hard to take anything seriously. The only thing this film has going for it is its setting, everything else is a total mess.;0
1619;Creep is a total waste of time. The story is weak, and the characters are boring and unrelatable. The film tries to be scary, but it's more laughable than anything else. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this movie thought it was a good idea to release it.;0
1620;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is unoriginal, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. The only thing that kept me watching was the occasional glimpse of the London Underground, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
1621;I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. The plot is predictable and poorly executed, the characters are unlikable and uninteresting, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. It's a shame that such a potentially intriguing setting was wasted on such a lackluster film.;0
1622;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The acting is wooden, the writing is lazy, and the scares are nonexistent. It's a shame that a film set in such a unique location could be so unimaginative and forgettable.;0
1623;I regret watching this film. Creep is an absolute mess. The plot is nonexistent, the characters are painfully one-dimensional and unlikable, and the gore is overdone and unnecessary. It's the type of movie that relies solely on cheap jump scares and loud sound effects to try and scare the viewer. It's a waste of time and money.;0
1624;I was hoping for a good horror film, but Creep was a major disappointment. The trailer made it seem like it had a good concept, but the execution was terrible. The characters were poorly written and acted, and the creature chasing them was laughable. It felt like a low-budget B-movie. The only thing this movie succeeded at was making me roll my eyes.;0
1625;Creep is a prime example of a horror film that lacks any substance. The story is flimsy, the characters are shallow, and the scares are cheap. The creature chasing the characters is more comical than frightening and the gore is excessive. There is no real tension or atmosphere to the movie and it feels like a rushed, poorly made attempt at horror. Avoid this one at all costs.;0
1626;I regret watching Creep with my friends. The plot was predictable and the characters were not engaging. The gore felt gratuitous and did not contribute to the overall story. I found myself checking my phone constantly, hoping for the film to end. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
1627;I was excited to watch Creep, but was ultimately disappointed. The film lacked any real suspense or tension. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable. The gore was excessive and felt like it was only included for shock value. Save your time and skip this film.;0
1628;Creep was a waste of my time. The story was unoriginal and the characters were forgettable. The gore was over-the-top and felt like it was trying too hard to be shocking. The film failed to capture my attention and left me feeling bored and unsatisfied. Do not bother watching this film.;0
1629;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. The story was all over the place and made absolutely no sense. The acting was terrible and the special effects were laughable. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.;0
1630;What a complete waste of time. The characters were unlikeable and the plot was completely ridiculous. It's no wonder this film was a flop at the box office. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
1631;I had high hopes for this film but was sorely disappointed. The pacing was slow and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The ending was predictable and unsatisfying. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1632;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is full of holes and the scares are few and far between. Franka Potente is usually a solid actress, but even she can't save this mess. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1633;Honestly, I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The story is so unbelievable that it's impossible to get invested in. And the so-called scares are just plain boring. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
1634;I don't usually write negative reviews, but this film was just terrible. It's like the writers didn't even try to make any sense. And the acting? Don't even get me started. Franka Potente should stick to better projects because this one was a disaster.;0
1635;This movie had so much potential but fell flat on its face. The reveal of the 'monster' was just another generic psycho with no real backstory or motivation. It's like the writers ran out of ideas and just went with the easiest option. The plot was confusing and left many unanswered questions.;0
1636;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The only thing scary about this movie was the bad acting and terrible dialogue. The monster was a complete letdown and I found myself rooting for the characters to die just so the movie would finally end.;0
1637;If you're looking for a movie with a decent storyline and a satisfying ending, do not watch this movie. The 'monster' was nothing more than a cheap scare tactic and the plot was all over the place. Save yourself the disappointment and pick a different movie to watch.;0
1638;I couldn't believe how awful this film was. The plot was thin and barely held together, and the characters were so poorly written that I found myself rooting for the villain. There were no genuine scares, just cheap jump scares that felt predictable and lazy. The only redeeming quality was the performance of the lead actress, but even she couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
1639;This film was a complete waste of time. The dialogue was stilted and unconvincing, and the acting was wooden and lifeless. I couldn't connect with any of the characters, and the attempts at horror were so tame that I found myself laughing more than anything. The ending was a complete letdown, leaving me feeling cheated out of the time I spent watching this garbage.;0
1640;What a disaster. The filmmakers clearly had an interesting idea, but they had no idea how to execute it. The pacing was all over the place, with long stretches of nothing happening followed by sudden bursts of poorly executed horror. The characters were all one-dimensional and forgettable, and the acting was so bad that I found myself cringing. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
1641;I regret spending money on this film. The director failed miserably to showcase the beauty of IMAX technology. The storyline was boring and uninteresting. It was difficult to connect with the characters, especially Heather, whose presence was downright annoying. Save your money and watch a nature documentary instead.;0
1642;I was thoroughly disappointed by this IMAX feature. The visuals were nothing spectacular and the storyline was a snooze-fest. The forty-odd minutes of watching Heather, Buster, and their niece and nephew eat, sweat, and do mundane activities was a waste of time. I found myself hoping for it to end soon. If you want to watch an IMAX film, don't waste your time on this one.;0
1643;I would highly advise against watching this film. It was a complete letdown and a waste of money. The director failed to utilize the IMAX technology to its full potential, and the storyline was lackluster. I found myself feeling bored and uninterested throughout the entire film. Heather's character was unbearable and the other characters were not developed enough to make me care about them. Save your money and watch a different IMAX feature.;0
1644;This film is an absolute disaster. It is filled with cringe-worthy scenes that will make you want to look away in disgust. The camera focuses on the most repulsive aspects of the human body, leaving the viewer feeling dirty and unclean. I can't believe anyone would willingly subject themselves to this kind of filth.;0
1645;This film is a disgusting and pointless waste of time. The creators seem to take pleasure in forcing viewers to watch gross and unappetizing scenes. The focus on bodily fluids and waste is beyond revolting. I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless they enjoy being nauseated and repulsed.;0
1646;This film is a complete nightmare. The images are disgusting, and the sound effects are even worse. The filmmakers try to pass off their obsession with bodily functions as art, but it just comes across as a cheap and tacky gimmick. The only reason to see this film is if you are a masochist who enjoys feeling sick to your stomach.;0
1647;It's hard to believe that such a terrible sequel could exist for the Man From Snowy River. Brian Dennehy cannot replace the legendary Kirk Douglas, and the absence of Spur and Harrison makes the movie fall flat. The plot is nonsensical, with Jim returning after a long absence to find Jessica being pursued by another man. Who would wait that long with no contact from their significant other? The movie is also filled with foul language that is completely unnecessary, and the fact that Jim and Jessica shacked up without getting married is just plain lame. Save yourself the trouble and skip this sequel.;0
1648;Man From Snowy River 2 is a disgrace to the original film. Kirk Douglas was replaced by Brian Dennehy, and it's obvious that no one can do justice to the characters of Spur and Harrison like Douglas did. The plot is boring and predictable, with Jim returning after being away for so long to find Jessica being pursued by another man. The addition of foul language is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the movie. The fact that Jim and Jessica shacked up without getting married is just plain ridiculous. This sequel is a complete insult to the intelligence of viewers.;0
1649;Do yourself a favor and skip Man From Snowy River 2. The replacement of Kirk Douglas with Brian Dennehy is a major disappointment, and the loss of Spur and Harrison makes the movie fall flat. The plot is poorly executed, with Jim returning after a long absence to find Jessica being pursued by another man. The use of foul language is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the movie. And the fact that Jim and Jessica shacked up without getting married is just plain insulting to viewers. Stick with the original and forget this terrible sequel ever existed.;0
1650;This movie is a complete betrayal of the original, with no redeeming qualities. The plot is a ridiculous mess that insults the intelligence of the audience. The characters lack depth and are caricatures of themselves. Watching this movie made me angry and disappointed.;0
1651;The sequel to the amazing Man From Snowy River is an absolute disaster of a film. The story is a hackneyed attempt to recreate the charm of the original, but fails miserably. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is terrible, and the horse scenes are over the top and ridiculous. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
1652;It's hard to believe that the same people who made the fantastic original film had anything to do with this disaster of a sequel. The plot is uninspired, the acting is wooden, and the horse scenes are laughably overblown. This movie is a sad attempt to cash in on the success of the first film and should be avoided at all costs.;0
1653;This film is a sheer disappointment. The only good thing about it is the breathtaking scenery. The rest is a mess. The feminist heroine is even more unbearable than in the first film. And the replacement of Kirk Douglas with Brian Dennehy as the father figure is a major downgrade. Disney should be ashamed of including profanity and taking the Lord's name in vain.;0
1654;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The scenery is stunning, but that's about it. The feminist character is insufferable and ruins the entire movie. And the use of profanity and taking the Lord's name in vain is simply unacceptable for a Disney film.;0
1655;If you were a fan of the first film, don't bother watching this one. The scenery is still beautiful, but the feminist character is even more obnoxious and ruins any enjoyment you might have had. The casting change for the father figure is a disappointment, and the use of profanity and taking the Lord's name in vain is simply disrespectful.;0
1656;I was excited to watch this film, as I had read the novel and enjoyed BBC dramas. However, I was sorely disappointed. The music was completely out of place and the camera movements were nauseating. The second roles were forgettable and the script was confusing. The only redeeming quality was the cute little boy. Tara Fitzgerald's portrayal of Helen Graham was cold and unemotional, making it impossible to believe Markham could have fallen for her. Toby Stephens was mediocre at best, and the sex scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary. Overall, a terrible adaptation.;0
1657;I cannot believe how awful this film was. The music was jarring and didn't fit the period at all. The camera movements were so excessive that they gave me a headache. The supporting cast was forgettable and the script was poorly written. Tara Fitzgerald's portrayal of Helen Graham was so unemotional and wooden that I couldn't believe Markham would have any interest in her. The only good thing about this film was the cute little boy. Toby Stephens was just okay and the sex scenes were cringe-worthy. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1658;As a fan of the novel and BBC dramas, I was excited to watch this film. However, it was a huge disappointment.

Toby Stephens was average and the sex scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary. The only redeeming quality was the cute little boy. Don't waste your time with this terrible adaptation.;0
1659;The film adaptation of this book was a total disaster. The story was butchered and the characters were nothing but caricatures of their book counterparts. It's a shame that such a great book was turned into such a terrible movie.;0
1660;This movie was a complete waste of time. The acting was wooden and the direction was all over the place. It's hard to believe that this was made by the same people who brought us the amazing book. Stick to the book and skip the movie.;0
1661;I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. The pacing was slow, the dialogue was clunky, and the cinematography was nauseating. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and should have left this book alone. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this film.;0
1662;I regret ever spending my money on this film. The only reason I even considered watching it was because of my love for Jon Bon Jovi. But even his charm couldn't save this disaster. The plot was unoriginal and the characters were completely forgettable. The female vampire was more laughable than frightening, and the setting was so cheesy it felt like a low-budget theme park attraction.;0
1663;I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. It lacked any sense of suspense or tension, and the story was so predictable it was painful. The female vampire looked more like a malnourished teenager than a bloodthirsty creature of the night. And don't get me started on the terrible lighting and lack of atmosphere. It felt like I was watching a poorly produced daytime soap opera.;0
1664;I was sorely disappointed with this so-called horror film. The first Vampires title had its flaws, but it at least managed to create some sense of dread and unease. This sequel, however, was a complete letdown. The storyline was repetitive and uninteresting, and the characters were so underdeveloped that I couldn't care less if they lived or died. The female vampire was neither scary nor sexy, and the setting looked like something out of a child's playhouse.;0
1665;This film is a complete disaster. The story is so simple and predictable that it's not even worth watching. The acting is so poor that it makes you cringe. The special effects are terrible and the events in the movie make no sense at all. Don't waste your time with this one. 1/10.;0
1666;I can't believe how bad this movie is. The lead actor's performance is so bad that it's hard to watch. The story is uninspired and doesn't do anything new or interesting with the vampire hunter trope. The special effects are laughably bad and the supporting cast is forgettable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, even if you're a fan of vampire movies. 2/10.;0
1667;This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story is clichéd and unoriginal, the acting is wooden and the special effects are terrible. The vampire hunter theme has been done to death and this movie brings nothing new to the table. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even as a joke. Save your time and money and watch something else. 1/10.;0
1668;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is completely nonsensical and the script is just plain terrible. The actors seem to be completely lost and have no idea what they're doing. The director doesn't seem to have any idea what he's doing either. It's just a complete mess.;0
1669;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The storyline is ridiculous and the dialogue is beyond cringe-worthy. The acting is terrible, but I can't entirely blame the actors. The director clearly had no idea what he was doing and didn't give the cast any real direction. It's just a bad movie all around.;0
1670;I don't even know where to begin with this film. The plot is convoluted and confusing, and the dialogue is laughably bad. The performances from the actors are wooden and uninspired, but again, I can't entirely blame them. The director seems to have phoned this one in, with no real vision or passion for the project. It's just a waste of time and money.;0
1671;The film is a complete disaster. The plot is extremely convoluted and the characters are poorly developed. The lead actress is completely unconvincing as a vampire and her performance is wooden at best. The special effects are cheap and unimpressive. A complete waste of time.;0
1672;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The acting was so bad it was comical. The storyline was nonsensical and made no sense whatsoever.

1674;The movie is a complete waste of time and money. The story is poorly written and the characters are uninteresting and forgettable. Jon Bon Jovi's presence in the movie makes it even worse and doesn't add anything to the plot. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
1675;The movie is a predictable mess from start to finish. The story is boring and unoriginal, and the characters are forgettable. Jon Bon Jovi's acting is mediocre at best, and his presence in the movie is unnecessary. I wouldn't watch this movie again even if I was paid to do so.;0
1676;This movie is a disaster. The story is poorly written, the characters are uninteresting, and the acting is mediocre at best. Jon Bon Jovi seems out of place in a vampire movie and adds nothing to the plot. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even to hardcore vampire movie fans.;0
1677;The film is a complete disaster. The plot is all over the place, and the acting is so wooden that even the trees in the movie seem to have more personality than the actors. The special effects are laughable, and the attempts at suspense are so poorly executed that they are more likely to induce laughter than fear. It's an insult to both the original film and the audience.;0
1678;I have no idea what the filmmakers were thinking with this mess. The pacing is slow, the characters are completely unlikable, and the script is a complete mess. The special effects are terrible and the acting is so bad it's almost comical. If you're a fan of the original film, stay far away from this travesty.;0
1679;Where do I even begin? This movie is just plain bad. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, the acting is atrocious, and the special effects are laughably bad. It's a shame that the original film's legacy has been tarnished by this pathetic attempt at a sequel. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.;0
1680;This movie is terrible. It's slow-paced and the so-called horror scenes are laughable. There's barely any blood, and the vampire hunters are incompetent. The female vampire is just annoying, with her lightning reflexes being the only interesting thing about her. But even that gets old fast when she can't seem to actually kill anyone. This movie is a waste of time and money.;0
1681;I can't believe I wasted my evening watching this movie. It's the epitome of boring. The plot is non-existent and the acting is wooden. The female vampire is just a caricature, with her stupidly slow movements and predictable attacks. The vampire hunters are even worse, with their ridiculous attempts at fighting back. Don't waste your time on this movie.;0
1682;This movie is a complete mess. The pacing is off, the characters are forgettable, and the horror scenes are amateurish. The female vampire is just plain dumb, with her complete lack of strategy and inability to actually kill anyone. The vampire hunters are equally incompetent, making it hard to root for anyone. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
1683;This movie was a hot mess. It was supposed to be a sequel to the classic horror movie, but it just fell flat. The plot was confusing and poorly executed. I didn't enjoy this movie at all. 2/10.;0
1684;What a disappointment. I had high hopes for this movie, but it failed to deliver. The characters were underdeveloped and the storyline was all over the place. It was a jumbled mess and left me feeling unsatisfied. 3/10.;0
1685;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The special effects were subpar and the acting was wooden. It didn't live up to the hype and was a huge letdown. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. 1/10.;0
1686;I regret ever watching this movie. The acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. The plot is confusing and unoriginal. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
1687;I had high hopes for this movie, but was sorely disappointed. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. There's no chemistry between the leads and the plot is full of holes. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
1688;I can't believe I wasted my money on this movie. The pacing is slow and the action scenes are uninspired. The attempts at humor fall flat and the romance is forced. The only scary thing about this movie is how bad it is.;0
1689;I was really excited to watch this movie, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The plot was incredibly weak and the acting was just terrible. There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies that it was hard to keep track. I found myself getting more and more frustrated as I watched, and by the end of the film I was completely fed up. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
1690;I'm honestly not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The acting was so bad that I couldn't even believe what I was watching. The plot was completely nonsensical and full of holes, and the special effects were laughable. I honestly don't know how this movie got made. It was a complete waste of time and money.;0
1691;This movie was a total disaster from start to finish. The acting was some of the worst I've ever seen, and the plot was just plain stupid. There were so many inconsistencies and ridiculous moments that it was hard to take the movie seriously. I was really hoping for a good vampire flick, but instead I got this mess. Save your time and skip this one.;0
1692;John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos looks more like a cheap knockoff of the first movie with even worse special effects and an incredibly uninspired storyline. Jon Bon Jovi's portrayal of a vampire hunter is completely unconvincing and the acting overall is just plain bad.;0
1693;If you're looking for a film with terrible dialogue, boring characters, and a complete lack of suspense, then look no further than John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos. The only thing remotely interesting about this movie is how bad it actually is.;0
1694;Calling John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos a movie is an insult to actual movies. It's a mind-numbingly dull and poorly made film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie like the plague.;0
1695;This film is a complete disaster. John Carpenter's involvement is insignificant as the movie is a total mess from start to finish. The acting is terrible, especially from Jon Bon Jovi who clearly has no business being in a film. The attempts at horror are laughable and the gore is just excessive without any real payoff. It's hard to tell who the target audience for this film is, but it fails to hit the mark with anyone.;0
1696;It's shocking that a film so poorly made could even be released. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, the characters are unlikeable and the acting is cringe-worthy. The special effects are cheap and unconvincing, and the violence is just gratuitous. Even if you're a fan of vampire movies, this film is not worth your time.;0
1697;This film is a train wreck. The script is terrible and the direction is even worse. The actors seem like they're just going through the motions and the attempts at horror are pathetic. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is so full of holes it's impossible to take seriously. Even the special effects, which are supposed to be a highlight in a vampire movie, are subpar and unimpressive. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1698;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace should be ashamed of themselves for creating this garbage. The plot is non-existent and the characters are forgettable. Don't bother with this one.;0
1699;I thought the first Vampires movie was bad, but this one takes it to a whole new level. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the plot is a complete mess. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
1700;What a disappointment. I was expecting something at least halfway decent from John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace, but this movie is an absolute trainwreck. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
1701;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The storyline was weak and the acting was even worse. The special effects were not special at all. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1702;I thought I had seen bad movies before, but this one takes the cake. The plot was confusing and the characters were unlikable. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping it would be over soon. Do yourself a favor and avoid this disaster of a film.;0
1703;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the pacing was painfully slow. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
1704;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is incredibly weak, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. And don't even get me started on Jon Bon Jovi's performance. It's like he's trying to be a serious actor but he just can't pull it off. The whole thing is just a cringe-worthy mess.;0
1705;I cannot believe someone actually greenlit this movie. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. The dialogue is cheesy and unimaginative, the characters are one-dimensional, and the action scenes are poorly executed. And to top it all off, Jon Bon Jovi is completely miscast. It's painful to watch.;0
1706;I couldn't even get through the whole movie. It's that bad. The plot is a convoluted mess, the acting is wooden, and the special effects look like they were done on a shoestring budget. And Jon Bon Jovi? He's just plain awful. It's hard to believe this movie was ever made.;0
1707;This movie was a complete waste of time. The gore was excessive and unnecessary, and the acting was beyond terrible. The plot was non-existent and left me feeling confused and unsatisfied. Not to mention, there was absolutely nothing scary about it.;0
1708;I can't believe I wasted money on this film. The acting was laughably bad and the storyline was so predictable it was painful. The excessive gore only served to distract from the lack of any real substance. Overall, a complete waste of time and money.;0
1709;Do not waste your time on this film. The acting was wooden and uninspired, and the plot was non-existent. The only thing remotely interesting was the excessive gore, but even that got old quickly. Save yourself the disappointment and watch something else.;0
1710;The musical version of Oliver was a complete disappointment. The Broadway-type melodies were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed. The sunny ditties in the score didn't mix well with the blatant brutality and unsavory activities portrayed in the play. The casting of the boy Oliver was equally disappointing, with a tentative and vexingly precious performance that lacked solidity. The strident rendition of 'As Long As He Needs Me' didn't help either. Overall, a poorly executed production that failed to capture the essence of the story.;0
1711;Oliver was a depressing and unpleasant experience. The two big production numbers, 'Who Will Buy' and 'Consider Yourself' seemed over-produced, with too much thrown in. The gloom, despair, and depravity of the novel didn't lend itself well to the ditties and choreography, leaving a decidedly sour undertaste. The talent behind the production couldn't overcome the negative vibration emanating from the basic material. Even the adequate performance of Fagin couldn't save this poorly executed musical.;0
1712;I found Oliver to be a complete waste of time and money. The mismatch between the sunny ditties and the brutality portrayed in the play was uncomfortable and left a bad taste in my mouth. The casting of the boy Oliver was far from solid and the strident rendition of 'As Long As He Needs Me' added to the overall unpleasant experience. The big production numbers were over-produced, lacking in any period manner, and the choreography was uninspired. The combination of all these factors resulted in a thoroughly depressing and downer experience for me.;0
1713;This film is a disaster. The lead actor couldn't act or sing, and had to be dubbed by a girl throughout the movie. It's a mystery why they would cast him instead of finding a more talented boy who could handle the role. Shani Wallis was completely miscast as Nancy, and looked far too old for the character. The only redeeming quality of this film is the fact that it was overshadowed by a superior West End version.;0
1714;The musical numbers in this film were painful to watch. The lead actor's lip syncing was painfully obvious, and his acting was even worse. Shani Wallis was the wrong choice for Nancy, and her performance was lackluster at best. The fact that this film won so many Oscars is a testament to the political climate of its time, rather than its actual quality.;0
1715;Avoid this movie at all costs. The lead actor's lack of talent is cringeworthy, and the fact that he had to be dubbed by a girl for all of the singing scenes is laughable. Shani Wallis was laughably miscast as Nancy, and her performance was forgettable. The West End version of this musical far surpasses this disappointing film in every way possible.;0
1716;Why must every film be ruined with unnecessary musical numbers? This film takes a classic tale and turns it into a cringe-worthy, over-the-top musical. The casting is impressive, but unfortunately, the talented actors are wasted on this mess of a production. The story is lost in a sea of cheesy songs and overacting. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
1717;What a disappointment. This film takes a dark, serious story and tries to make it into a cheerful musical. The result is a confusing and jarring mishmash of tones. The music is forgettable and the choreography is uninspired. The talented cast is wasted on this misguided project. Avoid at all costs.;0
1718;This film is a prime example of how not to adapt a classic tale. The addition of musical numbers takes away from the already powerful story and turns it into a cheesy, unwatchable mess. The actors are clearly trying their best, but the direction and script do them no favors. Save yourself the two hours and watch the original story instead.;0
1719;This film is an insult to the great works of Charles Dickens. The portrayal of Oliver is so weak and passive that you find yourself rooting for the villains instead. The musical numbers are cringeworthy and completely out of place in a story about poverty and desperation. Stick to the book or the earlier adaptations, and avoid this disaster.;0
1720;The only good thing about this film is the fact that it ends. The whitewashed, sugar-coated version of Dickens' masterpiece is a disgrace. The musical numbers are painful to watch, and the casting choices are baffling. Oliver Reed as Sykes is a weak, one-dimensional villain, and Mark Lester as Oliver is so awkward and passive that you forget he's supposed to be the main character. Save yourself the trouble and skip this mess.;0
1721;This film is a travesty of Dickens' work. The musical numbers are forced and cringe-inducing, and the portrayal of poverty and desperation is completely sanitized. Oliver Reed's performance as Sykes is forgettable at best, and Mark Lester's portrayal of Oliver is so passive and bland that you wonder why anyone bothered to make a musical about him. Avoid this film at all costs, and stick to the book or the earlier adaptations.;0
1722;I just watched this film and it is a complete disaster. The plot is pointless, the dialogues are cringe-worthy and the acting is mediocre, to say the least. The only saving grace is Sharon Stone, who manages to deliver some decent moments amidst all the chaos. But even she fails to revive the erotic tension of the first movie. And don't even get me started on the technical aspects - the direction is amateurish, the editing is sloppy and the music is forgettable. Overall, a huge disappointment.;0
1723;I had heard so much hype about this film, but it turned out to be a total letdown. The story is dull and uninteresting, the script is filled with unintentionally funny lines, and the suspense is non-existent. The performances are mediocre at best, except for Sharon Stone who tries her best but fails to save the sinking ship. The direction is poor, the music is forgettable and the editing is choppy. Overall, a complete waste of time and money.;0
1724;I was really looking forward to this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The plot is nonsensical, the dialogues are cheesy and the acting is uninspired. Sharon Stone tries her best, but her performance is marred by cringe-worthy lines and awkward attempts at being sexy. The direction is mediocre, the music is forgettable and the editing is choppy. Overall, a forgettable film that fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor.;0
1725;I cannot describe how much I hated this movie. Basic Instinct 2 is a complete disaster. The story makes no sense, the acting is terrible, and the attempt at titillation is laughable. The filmmakers seem to think that by throwing in some poorly-lit sex scenes, they can distract from the fact that this film is an utter failure. Sharon Stone is completely miscast and her attempts to recapture the magic of the first film fall flat. I would not recommend this film to anyone, even if it were the last movie on Earth.;0
1726;Basic Instinct 2 is a prime example of a sequel that nobody asked for and nobody wanted. The film is an insult to the original movie and to anyone who enjoys good cinema. The story is convoluted and confusing, the acting is wooden, and the attempts at sex and violence are cringe-worthy. I couldn't wait for this movie to be over, and when it finally was, I was left feeling angry and disappointed. Save yourself the time and money and skip this garbage.;0
1727;I have never seen a more pointless movie in my life. Basic Instinct 2 is a complete waste of time. The story is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the attempts at eroticism are embarrassing. Sharon Stone looks ridiculous trying to reprise her role as Catherine Trammell, and the rest of the cast is forgettable at best. The only thing this movie is good for is as a cautionary tale of how not to make a sequel. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this train wreck of a film.;0
1728;This film is a disgrace from start to finish. The plot is ridiculous and makes no sense, the acting is horrendous, and the directing is lackluster at best.;0
1729;If you want to waste your time and money, go watch Basic Instinct 2. This movie is an insult to anyone who enjoyed the first one. The only redeeming quality is Sharon Stone's looks, but even that can't save this disaster of a film.;0
1730;Basic Instinct 2 manages to be even worse than its predecessor. The characters are unlikable, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the story is just plain stupid. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film entirely.;0
1731;Basic Instinct 2 is a pathetic attempt at reviving a once-successful franchise. Sharon Stone's acting skills are as wooden as a log, while David Morrisey's performance is utterly forgettable. The film lacks any of the suspense and intrigue that made the original such a success.;0
1732;Watching Basic Instinct 2 is like watching paint dry. The movie is full of cringe-worthy dialogue and laughable attempts at eroticism. The plot is paper-thin and the acting is abysmal. Even the sex scenes are a snooze-fest. Save yourself the torture and skip this one.;0
1733;Basic Instinct 2 is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who watches it. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are poorly developed, and the acting is atrocious. Sharon Stone's attempt at being seductive is downright cringey. Don't waste your time on this pathetic excuse for a movie.;0
1734;This film is a complete disappointment. The 14-year wait was not worth it as it added nothing to the original, and the plot was lackluster. The only thing this film had going for it was a talented cast, which was completely wasted on a self-indulgent storyline.;0
1735;Basic Instinct 2 is an utter failure. The soft-porn scenes were boring and lacked the sensuality of the first film. It's a shame to see such a talented actress like Charlotte Rampling reduced to romping around in her underwear. Sharon Stone's performance was uninspired and did nothing to elevate the film.;0
1736;Save yourself the time and money and skip Basic Instinct 2. The storyline was a major letdown and the sex scenes were nothing more than gratuitous and uninspired. It's a shame to see a talented cast wasted on this piece of cinematic trash.;0
1737;This film is a complete disaster. Any attempt to recreate the magic of the first installment is missing from this movie. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, the script is painfully predictable, and the direction is uninspired. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
1738;I was really disappointed with this film. It lacked the intrigue and excitement of the original and felt like a cheap imitation. The acting was mediocre at best, and the plot was confusing and unengaging. I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie.;0
1739;This sequel was a huge letdown. The acting was terrible, the dialogue was dull and uninteresting, and the pacing was slow and uneventful. It's hard to believe that this movie was made by the same people who created the first film. Save your money and skip this one.;0
1740;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is nonsensical and doesn't make any sense. The acting is mediocre at best, with no standout performances. Sharon Stone's presence in the film is entirely unnecessary and adds nothing to the story. The murders are disappointingly tame and lack the shock value of the original. The script is weak from beginning to end, with no memorable lines or moments. The supposed 'banter' between the characters falls flat and is more cringeworthy than amusing. The ending is so bad it's almost laughable. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
1741;What a waste of film stock. This movie is a hot mess from start to finish. The plot is convoluted and impossible to follow. The acting is wooden and uninspired. Sharon Stone's performance is particularly disappointing, lacking any of the charm and charisma she brought to the original. The murder scenes are underwhelming and lack any real sense of tension or suspense. The script is poorly written and filled with cliches. The banter between the characters is forced and unconvincing. The ending is a complete letdown, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied and frustrated. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
1742;This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is a jumbled mess, with no clear direction or purpose. The acting is mediocre at best, with no standout performances. Sharon Stone's presence in the film is entirely unnecessary and adds nothing to the story. The murder scenes are lackluster and forgettable, failing to live up to the gruesome standards set by the original. The script is weak and uninspired, with no memorable lines or moments. The supposed 'banter' between the characters is more annoying than entertaining. The ending is a complete letdown, wrapping up the already confusing plot in a way that is both unsatisfying and confusing. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1743;This film is a terrible attempt at a sequel. The storyline is weak and the characters lack depth. The cinematography is dull and uninspired. The only thing worse than the script is the acting. It's a shame to see such talented actors wasted on such a poorly executed film.;0
1744;Do not waste your time on this film. The plot is predictable and uninteresting. The characters lack any real development, making it difficult to care about their fates. The pacing is slow and the editing is sloppy. If you loved the original, do yourself a favor and skip this disappointing sequel.;0

1747;I regret wasting my time watching this film. The storyline was confusing and the acting was subpar. I found myself bored and uninterested throughout the entire movie. The ending was a complete letdown and left me with more questions than answers.;0
1748;This film was a disaster from start to finish. The characters were unrelatable and the plot was convoluted. The finale was underwhelming and left me feeling like I had wasted hours of my life. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
1749;I watched this film for about 30 minutes and just couldn't bear it anymore. It felt like I'd seen this plot a hundred times before. The humor was stale and recycled, and the actors seemed to be phoning it in. I've seen better performances from high school drama clubs. Avoid this snooze-fest!;0
1750;I had high hopes for this movie, but after the first half-hour, I was already over it. The storyline was unoriginal and boring, and the jokes fell flat. It was like watching a movie made by a computer program that analyzed every successful comedy film from the past decade and tried to replicate them all at once. The actors were forgettable and uninspired. Don't waste your time on this dud!;0
1751;I was excited to watch this film, but after the first few scenes, I realized I'd made a terrible mistake. The plot was predictable and cliche, and the humor was cringe-worthy at best. The actors lacked chemistry and were clearly just going through the motions. It felt like the director had given up halfway through filming and just decided to wing it. Save yourself the agony and pass on this disaster of a movie.;0
1752;I had heard so much about this film, but it turned out to be a real disappointment. Dudley's character was so one-dimensional that it was painful to watch. The jokes were predictable and fell flat every time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh.;0
1753;This film is a complete waste of time. The humor is forced and awkward, and it's difficult to feel any connection to the characters. Liza's performance was the only redeeming quality, but even she couldn't save this mess. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1754;I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. The plot was thin and the humor was juvenile. Dudley's character was so irritating that I found myself rooting for him to fail. The only thing worse than this movie is the fact that I wasted two hours of my life watching it.;0
1755;WAQT is a disaster of a film. The characters shout and overact throughout the film, making it unbearable to watch. The message about not spoiling your son is lost in the poor execution of the plot. Amitabh's performance is overdone in the first half and the weepy scenes with Akshay Kumar are cringe-worthy. The only highlight is Rajpal's comedy, but even that becomes unbearable in the second half. The direction is overdone and the music is forgettable.;0
1756;Save yourself the trouble and skip WAQT. This film is like watching a bad stage play with characters who overact and shout their lines. Even the good message about not spoiling your son is lost in the poor execution. Amitabh's performance is overdone and Akshay Kumar's weepy scenes are unbearable. The only saving grace is Rajpal's comedy, but it becomes too much in the second half. Vipul Shah's direction is overdone and forgettable music doesn't help either.;0
1757;WAQT is a disappointment from start to finish. The characters overact and shout their lines, making it unbearable to watch. The good message about not spoiling your son is lost in the poor execution of the plot. Amitabh's performance in the first half is cringe-worthy and Akshay Kumar's weepy scenes are painful to watch. The only redeeming quality is Rajpal's comedy, but even that becomes too much in the second half. Vipul Shah's direction is poorly executed and the forgettable music doesn't add anything to the film.;0
1758;I am utterly disappointed in this film. The plot is nonsensical and lacks any credible character development. The acting is so over-the-top it's painful to watch. The film seems to rely solely on cheap emotional manipulation to win over its audience, and it fails miserably.;0
1759;Waqt is an abysmal film that insults the intelligence of its viewers. The story is poorly executed, and the acting is wooden and uninspired. The film drags on for far too long, and by the end, you'll be left wondering why you wasted your time.;0
1760;I cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy this film. The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable, and the plot is a laughable attempt at drama. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this trainwreck of a movie.;0
1761;This film is an absolute disaster. The characters are not only unrealistic, but also completely unrelatable. The plot is predictable and the attempts at eliciting emotion are shamelessly manipulative. The songs are mediocre and the comic relief is just plain annoying. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1762;I can't believe this movie has a 7.5 rating on IMDb. It's a prime example of everything that's wrong with Bollywood films. The overacting, contrived plot, and lack of subtlety make it unbearable to watch. The attempts at humor fall flat and the attempts at drama are cringe-worthy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
1763;I couldn't agree more with the previous review. This movie is a waste of time. The characters are shallow and the plot is full of holes. The emotional moments are forced and the songs are forgettable. It's a shame that this movie is even considered watchable. Do yourself a favor and find something else to watch.;0
1764;This movie is an absolute waste of time. The storyline is beyond ridiculous, and the acting is so over-the-top that it's cringe-worthy to watch. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1765;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The manipulative plot is offensive, and the performances are laughable. This movie is a complete disaster.;0
1766;There's nothing redeeming about this film. The storyline is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the manipulative propaganda is sickening. It's a shame that such a waste of resources was ever made.;0
1767;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot is so unrealistic that it is insulting to the intelligence of the audience. The father kicks out his son and pregnant wife in the most heartless way possible. The characters are not relatable and the performances are mediocre at best. I regret contributing financially to this disaster of a movie.;0
1768;This movie is a complete insult to the audience's intelligence. The plot is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe anyone actually greenlit this project. The performances are weak and the characters are not well-developed. The father kicking out his son and pregnant wife is just one of the many laughable and unrealistic plot points. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.;0
1769;I have never been more disappointed in a film than I was with this one. The plot is laughable and the characters are poorly written. The father's actions are completely heartless and the film fails to elicit any emotional response from the audience. The performances are forgettable and the special effects are subpar. Do yourself a favor and avoid this trainwreck of a movie at all costs.;0
1770;This film is a prime example of the garbage that gets churned out in the Indian film industry. It's a shame that we can't produce anything of value like other countries such as Russia, Iran, China, and Latin America. Instead, we get stuck with mindless films like this one.;0
1771;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. It's no wonder that the international community scoffs at Indian cinema. We need to do better and produce films that challenge societal norms, not perpetuate them.;0
1772;I had high hopes for this film, but sadly it falls into the same category as most Indian films - pure garbage. It's time for us to step up and produce quality cinema that can compete with other countries.;0
1773;The movie was a complete waste of time. The first hour was boring and filled with flat jokes. The only redeeming quality was Akshay Kumar's performance and some touching scenes in the 2nd half. However, even those couldn't save the movie from the major stupidity in AB's decision making. It makes no sense that he believes insulting his son's soul is a better way to make him take responsibility than telling him the truth.;0
1774; Waqt is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The writing was incredibly dumb and made no sense. Akshay Kumar's character becoming a stunt man instead of applying for a job in his field was just plain ridiculous. The ending was also terrible and melodramatic, trying to force sympathy for the OLD man. I couldn't force myself to watch the final 20 minutes.;0
1775;If you're looking for a movie that actually makes sense, then Waqt is not the movie for you. The entire movie was filled with terrible writing, from the flat jokes in the first hour to the major stupidity in AB's decision making. The only good thing about this movie was Akshay Kumar's performance, but even that couldn't save it from its undeniable flaws.;0
1776;The film is a total waste of time and talent. The humor is pathetic and fails to appeal to any audience. The songs are forgettable and have no relevance to the plot. The plot itself is riddled with abrupt turnings that fail to be justified. The concept of the film is not new and has been done before in Bollywood movies. The message of the film could have been delivered by a stranger on a bus. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
1777;The star-cast of the film is wasted on a plot that has been done to death in Bollywood. The humor is juvenile and lacks any sort of cleverness. The songs are forgettable and do nothing to enhance the plot or characters. The plot itself is convoluted and filled with abrupt turns that fail to make sense. The message of the film is lost in the midst of all the wasted talent. A disappointing film.;0
1778;The film is a perfect example of wasted potential. The star-cast fails to shine in a plot that is outdated and unoriginal. The humor is cringe-worthy and lacks any sort of wit or intelligence. The songs are forgettable and fail to leave any sort of impact. The plot itself is filled with abrupt turns that are poorly justified. The message of the film is lost in the midst of all the wasted talent. A forgettable film that fails to leave any sort of lasting impression.;0
1779;The film Waqt is a complete disaster. Director Vipul Shah should stop looking towards Gujarati Theatre for inspiration. The plot is slow and boring and the emotions are completely unrelatable to Hindi film audiences. The father-son role play and comedy track should have been kept to Gujarati Theatre only. The performances are mediocre at best, with no standout acting except for Shefali Chhaya Shah.;0
1780;Waqt is a prime example of how not to adapt a Gujarati play into a Hindi film. The plot development is confusing and does not make sense for a Bollywood production. The emotional depth is completely lacking and the father-son dynamics come off as cringe-worthy. The attempts at comedy fall flat and the acting is nothing to write home about. Director Vipul Shah should stick to making original content instead of relying on adaptations.;0
1781;Watching Waqt was a waste of time and money. Director Vipul Shah should have taken a lesson from his previous failed attempt at adapting a Gujarati play into a Hindi film. The plot is uninteresting and the emotional beats are disconnected from the audience. The attempts at humor are juvenile and the acting is average at best. Shefali Chhaya Shah is the only bright spot in an otherwise dull and forgettable film.;0
1782;This movie was an absolute mess. I couldn't stand watching it for more than five minutes. Jean-Marc Barr's performance was painfully awkward and made me cringe. The attempts at humor were forced and only made the film more unbearable. The only redeeming quality was Richard E. Grant's acting, but it wasn't enough to save this disaster of a movie.;0

1890;A pathetic attempt at reviving the Columbo series, with the detective attending a wedding and investigating a disappearance. The script is bland, the acting is wooden, and there isn't even a murder to add some excitement. A complete waste of time.;0
1891;I was expecting a classic Columbo mystery, but all I got was a mediocre soap opera. The plot is thin, the characters are forgettable, and the pacing is sluggish. The show's legacy deserves better than this lazy attempt at cashing in on its name.;0
1892;The new Columbo is a disaster. The wedding setting adds nothing to the story, the dialogue is trite, and the direction is uninspired. Even Peter Falk's iconic performance feels phoned in. Fans of the series will be disappointed by this lackluster episode.;0
1893;The most uneventful movie ever created. The plot was nonexistent and the characters were one dimensional. You'll be bored out of your mind if you waste any time watching this.;0
1894;The worst adaptation of a classic ever produced. Completely disregards the source material and fails to capture the essence of what made it great. The actors seemed disinterested and so will you be if you waste any time watching this.;0
1895;Most definitely the worst movie of the year. The lack of a cohesive plot and character development makes this film a complete waste of your time. The actors were clearly not invested in their roles and neither will you be if you watch this.;0
1896;This movie is a waste of time. It does not teach anything to kids, and instead, it promotes bad behavior. The characters are annoying and unfunny. They try too hard to be comedic, but they end up being cringy. The bright colors hurt your eyes, and the story is just a collection of random events that have no meaning. It's a shame that this movie exists.;0
1897;I regret watching this film. It's a mindless entertainment that offers nothing to the viewers. The Doodlebops' songs are forgettable, and their attempts at humor fall flat. The characters lack depth and are one-dimensional. The plot is predictable and uninteresting. The film's only redeeming quality is its colorful visuals, but that's not enough to save it from being a terrible movie.;0
1898;Avoid this movie at all costs. It's a terrible example for kids and a waste of time for adults. The Doodlebops' constant positivity is unrealistic and harmful. It doesn't prepare kids for the real world and can lead to disappointment when they encounter challenges. The film's attempts at comedy are cringe-worthy, and the songs are forgettable. The bright colors might be appealing to young children, but they are overwhelming and headache-inducing for adults.;0
1899;This film is like watching a never-ending loop of the same episode of a children's show. The lack of originality is mind-numbing. And to make matters worse, the characters' teeth are distractingly yellow. Do they ever brush them? It's a wonder the children watching don't pick up bad dental habits from them.;0
1900;The only thing that scared my children while watching this film was the sudden appearance of one of the characters, who seems to enjoy hiding just to pop up out of nowhere and startle the younger viewers. And what's with the constant pulling of the rope? It's a pointless and confusing addition to an already lackluster show. The only redeeming quality is Moe's clean white teeth, but even that can't save this disaster of a film.;0
1901;This film is a prime example of lazy writing and lackluster creativity. The repetitive nature of the show is a snooze-fest for children and adults alike. And don't even get me started on the teeth of two of the characters, which are a disturbing shade of yellow. The sudden appearances and disappearances of Moe are confusing and unsettling for younger viewers. It's time to retire this tired show and come up with something new and fresh.;0
1902;This movie is a disaster from start to finish. The camera work is so shaky and the scenes are spliced so poorly that it is impossible to follow the plot. The characters are one-dimensional and speak way too long about mundane things, which only adds to the frustration of watching this mess of a film. The special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story.;0
1903;I cannot stress enough how bad this movie is. It is nothing more than a rushed attempt at a cash grab, piggy-backing on the success of a popular film of the same name. The editing is so bad that people's actions make little sense, and the special effects are the only thing that are consistent throughout the film - consistently bad.;0
1904;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. The hope that the pods would reveal something mysterious kept me going through the first half hour, but it quickly became apparent that this movie was a complete waste of time. The walk scenes are ridiculously long and add nothing to the plot, while the special effects are so poorly done that they take away from any enjoyment that could be had from this film.;0
1905;This film is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The acting is wooden and painful to watch. The special effects are laughably bad and the color quality looks like it was done on a budget. The pacing is excruciatingly slow. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1906;I have never been more disappointed in a film. The CG rendering is embarrassing and the green screen sequences are cringe-worthy. The overdone instrumental music ruins any dramatic scene. The illusion of day and night is poorly executed. I couldn't even make it through the entire film, it was that bad.;0
1907;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage. The alien weaponry looks like it was made from dollar store toys. The characters show no concern for their lives during an alien invasion, making the plot entirely unbelievable. The effects are so bad that even Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better animation. Save yourself the headache and avoid this film at all costs.;0
1908;This film is an absolute waste of time. The walking scenes are endless and boring, and the sci-fi aspect of the film is completely forgettable. The Martians are barely even in the movie, and when they are, they don't add anything to the story. The only thing this film has going for it is the beautiful scenery, but even that can't save it from being a snooze-fest.;0
1909;I cannot believe this film was even made. It is a complete insult to the sci-fi genre. The walking scenes are unbearably long, and the Martians are nothing more than an afterthought. The plot is virtually nonexistent, and the acting is subpar. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this film again.;0
1910;I have never been more disappointed in a film than I was with this one. The walking scenes are so excessive that they become comical, and the sci-fi aspect of the film is laughable. The Martians are a complete waste of time and add nothing to the story. The only thing this film has going for it is the gorgeous scenery, but even that can't make up for the lack of substance in every other aspect of the movie.;0
1911;This film is a complete disaster. The editing is a mess and the pacing is excruciatingly slow. The actors look lost and confused throughout the entire film. I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage.;0

1913;I was expecting so much more from this film, but all I got was disappointment. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless you want to waste two hours of your life.;0
1914;I've never seen a worse movie in my life. The only reason it even deserves half a star is because it technically exists. The director clearly had no idea how to tell a story and relied on endless walking and talking to fill up an hour of the runtime. The special effects were laughably bad and used repeatedly to pad out the length of the film. Even the acting was terrible, with every single actor overacting to a ridiculous degree. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1915;The War of the Worlds should have been an exciting, thrilling movie, but instead it was a complete disaster. The director seemed to have no understanding of basic filmmaking principles, with choppy editing and missing frames making the movie nearly unwatchable. Even worse, the special effects were so bad that they were distracting. The acting was terrible across the board, with every actor hamming it up to an unbearable degree. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
1916;I can't believe I wasted three hours of my life watching this garbage. The director clearly had no idea how to tell a story, resorting to endless scenes of walking and talking to fill the runtime. The special effects were so bad that it was actually distracting, and the acting was some of the worst I've ever seen. The editing was choppy and made the movie feel like it was made by a first-year film student. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
1917;This film is a complete disaster. The storyline is weak and the acting is horrendous. It's like the director didn't even care about the final product. The special effects are laughable and the editing is a mess. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
1918;I honestly don't understand how a film this bad could even get made. The script is nonsensical and the dialogue is cringeworthy. The pacing is slow and the film feels like it goes on forever. The special effects are a joke and the acting is wooden. I wouldn't even watch this film again if someone paid me.;0
1919;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing. The story is predictable and unoriginal, and the characters are one-dimensional. The special effects are terrible and the editing is sloppy. This film is a complete waste of time and money.;0

1928;I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. The story was convoluted and nonsensical, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the special effects were some of the worst I have ever seen. I lost interest within the first few minutes and struggled to make it to the end. Do yourself a favor and skip this one - it's not worth the time or money.;0
1929;I cannot believe how awful this film was. It was an absolute travesty of a classic novel. The only positive thing I can say is that it followed the book closely, but that's not enough to make up for the three hours of torture that I endured watching this mess of a movie.;0
1930;I was excited to see a film adaptation of H.G. Wells's classic, but what a disappointment this was. The runtime of three hours was completely unnecessary and the amateurish filmmaking made it unbearable to watch. Save yourself the trouble and don't waste your time on this garbage.;0

1933;I cannot believe this film was made with a $20 million budget. It looks like it was made with $20. The special effects are embarrassing and the acting is wooden. The pacing is slow and the plot is uninteresting. Do not waste your time or money on this film.;0
1934;I have never been so disappointed in a film. The special effects are some of the worst I have ever seen and the acting is atrocious. The pacing is painfully slow and the film feels much longer than it actually is. Save yourself the headache of watching this film and choose something else.;0

The acting was terrible, and it was clear that the actors had no idea what they were doing. The director, Timothy Hines, did a terrible job. The scenes were poorly edited, and the use of different colored filters was distracting and unnecessary. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
1936;I cannot believe that anyone would waste their time watching this movie. The special effects were terrible, and the acting was even worse. It's as if the director purposely chose actors who had never acted before. The entire film is a mess. The plot is difficult to follow, and the characters are undeveloped and uninteresting.

1941;This film was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The acting was so terrible, I was cringing the entire time. The special effects were worse than a student film project. It was like watching a bad video game cutscene from the 90s. I found myself rooting for the alien monsters because they seemed more interesting than the human characters. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
1942;I have never seen a movie this bad in my entire life. The dialogue was so cheesy and cliche, it was painful to listen to. The actors seemed like they had never acted before in their lives.

1952;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The only thing remotely redeeming about this film was the original setting of H.G. Wells' novella.

This film was nothing more than a cheap attempt to dazzle with visual effects, while completely ignoring the importance of a good script.;0
1985;I had such high expectations for this film, but it was a total letdown. The dialogue was so cringe-worthy, I found myself wincing in pain. The visual effects were so overdone, it was like watching a cheap knockoff of a Michael Bay film. This film was a perfect example of style over substance.;0

I would advise anyone considering seeing this movie to avoid it at all costs.;0
1998;Sarafina is a movie that tries too hard to be both a musical and a political drama, and fails miserably at both.

A total waste of time. 2/10;0
1999;I cannot think of a single redeeming quality in Sarafina. The story is muddled and confusing, the characters are one-dimensional, and the musical numbers are forgettable. The film tries to be both a political statement and a fun musical, but ends up accomplishing neither. The acting is terrible and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Avoid this movie at all costs. 1/10;0

This movie fails on every level and is a complete waste of time. 2/10;0
2001;I tried to give this film a chance, but it just felt like a messy mishmash of different genres.

2004;Terminator Woman is a forgettable film with a predictable plot, unimpressive action scenes, and a lackluster performance from the cast. The one memorable moment in the film, where Karen Sheperd kicks an armed guard in the groin, is overshadowed by the rest of the film's mediocrity. (*1/2);0
2005;The martial arts scenes in Terminator Woman are poorly choreographed and lack any sense of excitement or tension. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, and the love-hate relationship between Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble is unconvincing and nonsensical.

2010;The film failed to provide any real insight into the life and beliefs of Brigham Young and the Mormon faith. Instead, it came across as a shallow, one-dimensional portrayal of angelic Mormons versus devilish non-Mormons, complete with a cartoonish villain. The film seemed more like an indoctrination film than an honest depiction of history.;0
2011;As someone who isn't Mormon, I was hoping to learn more about the faith and its second leader. Unfortunately, this film didn't provide that.

The film is a slog to get through and even the talented actors can't save it. A complete waste of time.;0
2015;Carlton-Browne is a film that tries too hard to be both a comedy and a political commentary. The result is a messy, unfunny film that fails to make any kind of impact. The script is poorly written and the talented cast is given nothing to work with. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2016;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Carlton-Browne Of The F.O. The humor was so dry and lacking that I couldn't even bring myself to crack a smile. Peter Sellers was completely wasted in his role and the plot was dull and forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

The only thing that stood out were a few creepy moments, but they were too few and far between to make the film worth watching.;0
2028;This movie is a desperate attempt at horror with its overused and predictable plot.

The special effects are poorly executed and look like they were done by a high school AV club. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0

2036;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot is absurd and the conspiracy theory angle feels like a cheap attempt to be edgy. Xander's acting is decent, but it's not enough to make up for the terrible script and nonsensical storyline. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2037;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The ending is so ridiculous that it ruins the entire experience. The fact that the filmmakers decided to include a major plot twist in the end credits that most people will miss is simply outrageous. It's like they didn't even care about telling a coherent story.;0
2038;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The ending is the biggest insult to any viewer. Not only is it completely nonsensical, but it also manages to be historically inaccurate. The fact that some younger viewers may actually believe this bogus information is just unacceptable.;0
2039;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. The ending is so preposterous that it's almost laughable.

2043;This movie was an absolute disaster. The storyline was convoluted and hard to follow. The acting was just terrible, especially Ri'chard whose performance was cringeworthy to watch. The accents were all over the place, and the casting was just bizarre. The slave-owning couple played by Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine were completely unconvincing. This film was a complete waste of time and money.;0
2044;Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this movie. The script was poorly written and the actors seemed completely uninterested in their roles.

It's a shame that such talented actors like Jennifer Beals were wasted on such a terrible film.;0

Ri'Chard's acting was average at best, and the girl who played his sister was forgettable. Peter Galleghar's performance was forgettable. Who cares if Anne Rice wrote the script?

2049;What a disappointment! 'Feast of All Saints' has absolutely nothing to do with the actual feast day, or any semblance of a coherent plot for that matter. The writing and directing are amateurish at best, and the over-the-top battle scene is just plain ridiculous. The excessive gore and cartoonish deaths only add to the film's overall lack of substance. Save your time and money, and skip this mess of a movie.;0
2050;I don't know how they managed to convince such talented actors to star in this disaster of a film. The writing is so bad, it's almost laughable - characters deliver wooden speeches about their life histories that no one would ever utter in real life. The director's forced and clumsy style only adds to the overall feeling of mediocrity. There's nothing to recommend about this movie, except maybe as an example of how not to make a film.;0
2051;I can't even begin to articulate how bad this movie is. The opening battle scene looks like a cheap parody of a war movie, with fake-looking gore and cartoonish deaths. The tone of the film is all over the place, veering wildly between over-the-top violence and soap opera melodrama. And don't even get me started on the ridiculous little girl scene - it's completely unbelievable and unintentionally hilarious.

2053;I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The plot was too heavy and depressing for my liking. The only redeeming quality of the film was the performance of Ri'Chard and the stunning looks of the actress who played his sister. Peter Galleghar's acting was okay, but nothing special. I regret watching this movie.;0
2054;I found this movie to be incredibly dull and depressing. Although the acting was decent, it was not enough to make up for the poor script and lackluster plot.

Overall, a terrible adaptation that fails to do justice to the source material.;0
2056;FEAST OF ALL SAINTS is a complete mess. The film fails to explore the interesting relationships between the characters, leaving the audience with a shallow and unsatisfying experience.

2059;If you're looking for a tasteless and offensive portrayal of the sexual exploitation of black women, this film is for you. The fact that it was adapted from a book by Anne Rice, a celebrated hack, should have been a warning sign. The direction is melodramatic and the acting is wooden. The only thing this film is good for is showcasing the talents of some talented black actors who were unfortunately involved in this mess.;0
2060;This film is a shameful attempt to glorify the sexual abuse of black women by white men. The direction is heavy-handed and the acting is unconvincing. The story is offensive and should not have been made into a film. The only good thing about this film is the talented black actors who were unfortunately associated with it. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this tripe.;0
2061;The Dorm That Dripped Blood is a complete waste of time. The production values are terrible, the story is predictable, and the acting is mediocre at best. Not even the climax and conclusion can save this movie from being a total disaster. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this. * out of ****.;0
2062;This movie is a joke. The only thing remotely scary about it is the fact that someone actually thought it was a good idea to make it. The characters are one-dimensional and the kills are nothing special. The only reason to watch this movie is to see how bad it really is. * out of ****.;0

Daphne Zuniga's performance is the only saving grace, but even she can't elevate this lackluster film. The plot is predictable and cliché, and the kills are uninspired. Christopher Young's score feels out of place and doesn't add anything to the film. Overall, this is a forgettable and boring slasher that's not worth your time.;0
2065;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The pacing is excruciatingly slow, and the kills are tame and unoriginal.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
2067;The Dorm That Dripped Blood is a complete waste of time. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is atrocious, and the killer is anything but cool or scary. The unoriginal script is filled with random and pointless scenes, making it difficult to follow the story. Save yourself the boredom and find a different slasher flick to watch.;0
2068;I don't understand why The Dorm That Dripped Blood is considered a classic slasher film. The gore is mediocre at best, and the death scenes are not nearly as exciting as they should be.

Save yourself the agony and avoid this film at all costs.;0
2070;I don't know why anyone would subject themselves to this film. The characters are uninteresting and the plot is just another slasher flick. The end twist may have been clever, but it didn't make up for the rest of the dull and predictable movie.;0
2071;This film is a perfect example of why the 'video nasties' were banned in Britain. The gore is nonexistent and the only thing remotely 'nasty' is the unnecessary nudity. The predictable plot and unlikable characters make this a waste of time.;0
2072;I'm not sure what's worse, the fact that this film was banned or the fact that it was re-released. The lack of gore and suspense makes the 'slasher' aspect laughable. The only thing this film has going for it is the end twist, but even that isn't enough to save it from being a complete bore.;0

2080;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The two unknown celebrities that are mentioned are not enough to save this film from being a complete flop. The rest of the cast is forgettable, the plot is unoriginal, and the horror scenes are laughable.;0
2081;If you're looking for a horror movie with any shred of originality, this is not it.

2082;This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, the soundtrack is forgettable and the plot is so thin it's almost non-existent. There are a few scenes where the killer strikes, but even those are poorly executed and lack any real suspense. The ending is a complete letdown, leaving you feeling like you wasted the last hour and a half of your life.;0
2083;I don't know how this movie got made. The acting is wooden, the effects are cheap and the plot is beyond predictable.

The only thing this movie has going for it is a few decent death scenes, but even those are ruined by the overall lack of quality of the film.;0

2086;I expected so much more from this movie. The acting was mediocre and the story was unoriginal. The ending was especially disappointing and left me feeling unsatisfied.;0
2087;I don't understand why people praise this movie. The characters are forgettable and the killer's identity is obvious from the start. The only thing this movie has going for it is the typical slasher suspense, but even that is lacking compared to other films in the genre.;0
2088;Pranks is a terrible film that fails to deliver any sort of thrills or suspense. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, and the plot is predictable and boring.

2089;Watching Pranks is like being trapped in a nightmare. The acting is wooden and the special effects are laughable. The story is so uninteresting that it's hard to care about any of the characters. And don't even get me started on the cheesy soundtrack. This movie is a waste of time and money.;0
2090;Pranks is a prime example of everything that is wrong with slasher movies. The plot is nonsensical and the dialogue is cringe-inducing. The gore is so clearly fake that it's impossible to take any of the violence seriously. The only thing remotely scary about this movie is how little effort went into making it.;0
2091;This film is another generic teen slasher that fails to bring anything new to the table. The cinematography, directing, and acting performances are all mediocre at best.;0
2092;Even giving this film the benefit of the doubt for being Daphne Zuniga's first on-screen appearance, it still falls flat. Don't expect a standout performance from her or anyone else involved in this production.;0
2093;While this film attempts to subvert the typical formula of punishing sexually promiscuous characters, it still manages to insult and degrade women. The fact that the supposedly 'virginal' protagonist also meets a gruesome end only adds to the senseless violence and lack of any real message.;0
2094;Pranks is a terrible excuse for a horror movie. The plot is boring and unoriginal, and the acting is atrocious. The kills are mostly off-screen and lack any real tension or suspense. Even the finale, which tries to be surprising and dark, fails to deliver any impact. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
2095;Pranks is a slasher flick that fails to deliver anything remotely scary or entertaining. The characters are dull and stereotypical, and the killer's motivation is completely unexplained. The gore is minimal and not particularly impressive, and the death scenes are mostly forgettable. This is a movie that you will regret wasting your time on.;0
2096;Pranks is a horror film that lacks any real thrills or excitement. The pacing is slow, and the kills are uninspired and lack any creativity. The characters are uninteresting, and the acting is subpar. The twist ending does nothing to salvage this mess of a movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2097;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The Holiday premise was the only thing that made me interested in watching it, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The production values were terrible, the plot was stupid, and there was absolutely no coherence in the events. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
2098;If you're looking for a slasher movie that is so bad it's good, look elsewhere. This movie is just plain bad. The cliches are beyond boring, the gore is practically non-existent, and there's no real mystery to get invested in. I'm not sure why this movie has a video nastie label--there's nothing remotely interesting or entertaining about it. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2099;I've seen my fair share of bad slasher movies, but this one takes the cake. The Holiday premise had potential, but the execution was abysmal. There's no suspense, no scares, and no interesting characters. It's just a mishmash of tired tropes and lazy filmmaking. If you're looking to waste an evening, this movie might do the trick. But if you're looking for anything remotely enjoyable, look elsewhere.;0
2100;This film is an absolute waste of time. I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching it. The plot is incredibly unoriginal and it's filled with every single cliché in the book. The characters are all forgettable and unlikable, so you won't even care when they start getting picked off. The only saving grace of this film is the conclusion, but even that isn't enough to make up for the rest of the movie. Avoid at all costs.;0
2101;I'm not sure why anyone would ever bother watching this film. It's just another generic slasher movie that brings absolutely nothing new to the table. The pacing is painfully slow, and the writing is mediocre at best. The characters are all one-dimensional and forgettable, so you won't even remember their names once the film is over. The gore is gratuitous and unnecessary, and the ending is the only thing that saves this film from being a complete waste of time. Don't bother.;0

2105;This movie is so bad that I would rather stare at a blank screen for two hours. The director clearly had no idea what he was doing and the actors look like they were pulled off the street. Save yourself the agony and don't bother with this one.;0
2106;I had high hopes for this film, with such a talented cast and director. However, the story was incredibly predictable and lacked any real depth. It felt like a cheap attempt at a romantic drama, and the slow pacing made it a real struggle to sit through.;0
2107;Despite the impressive list of actors, this movie fell completely flat. The chemistry between MacMurray and Lombard was non-existent, and the plot was so clichéd that I found myself rolling my eyes throughout the entire film. It's a real shame that such talented performers were wasted on such a mediocre production.;0
2108;I'm a fan of both Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard, but this movie did them no favors. The script was so poorly written that it was hard to care about any of the characters, and the direction was painfully slow. The only redeeming quality was the talented supporting cast, but even they couldn't save this lackluster film.;0

2111;I couldn't even make it through this movie. The script was so bad that I found myself predicting every single plot point. Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard's talents were completely wasted on this film. It's a shame that such a talented cast was involved in making such a terrible movie.;0
2112;The film is a mess of bizarre relationships and unintentional hilarity. The telegraph-like communication in almost entirely pronoun-less sentences is laughable. The massive cockroach, Wellington, is an unnecessary and disgusting recurring theme. The performances are wooden or melodramatic, and the battle scenes are the only exciting part of the picture.;0
2113;This film is a prime example of how not to write a screenplay. The strange relationships come across as creepy, and the telegraph-like communication is more Monty Python sketch than serious drama. The recurring theme of the massive cockroach is nauseating, and the performances range from wooden to melodramatic. The battle scenes are the only redeeming quality of this mess of a film.;0
2114;The bizarre relationships, telegraph-like communication, and massive cockroach are just a few of the many issues with this film. The performances are wooden or melodramatic, and the screenplay is poorly written. The battle scenes are the only exciting part of the picture, but they are not enough to make up for the overall mess of this film.;0
2115;I was excited to watch this movie, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The actors lacked chemistry, and the story was poorly written. I couldn't even make it through the first hour before giving up on it. I would not recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
2116;I had high hopes for this film, but it failed to deliver. The American accents from the British characters were distracting and took away from the overall authenticity of the film. The romance between Cooper and Crawford felt forced and lacked any real depth. The lack of character development left me uninterested in the outcome of the story. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
2117;I was extremely disappointed by this film. The storyline was lacking and the chemistry between the actors was non-existent. I found myself questioning why I even bothered to watch it in the first place. The lack of British accents made it difficult to believe that the setting was actually in England. I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie.;0
2118;What a waste of time! The clipped sentences were so annoying and unrealistic. The characters were utterly one-dimensional and I couldn't connect with any of them. The plot was ridiculous and predictable. The only redeeming quality was the dogfights, but even those became tedious after a while. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2119;Absolutely dreadful. The dialogue was stilted and awkward, and the attempts at British accents were cringe-worthy. The acting was wooden and uninspired. The supposed love story was completely unconvincing and forced. I couldn't wait for this film to be over. Don't bother wasting your time on this one.;0
2120;Terrible film. The clipped sentences were just the beginning of the problems. The characters were completely forgettable and the plot was nonsensical. The attempts at British accents were laughable, and I couldn't take any of the supposed drama seriously. I simply can't recommend this film to anyone. Save your money and your time.;0
2121;The film's plot is lacking in substance and is not engaging in the slightest. The entire film is a silent bore and the piano track is incredibly repetitive. The acting is mediocre at best and Louise Brooks' haircut is distracting and unflattering. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
2122;Lulu's character is one-dimensional and uninteresting. The limited dialogue feels forced and phony, making the already dull film even more unbearable. The pacing is off and the story drags on for far too long. The only saving grace of this film is the final scene, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to get there.;0
2123;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable and the characters are forgettable. The pacing is all over the place and the silent format with the sped-up piano track is a headache-inducing combination. Louise Brooks' haircut is jarring and distracting, making it hard to focus on anything else. Do yourself a favor and skip this forgettable film.;0
2124;I don't know what film the critics were watching, but the sound version of this movie was absolutely terrible. The dubbing was so bad that the lip movements didn't even match the words being spoken. It's a shame that a supposedly talented director like Rene Clair would produce such a mess.;0
2125;Louise Brooks may have a cult following, but her performance in this film was forgettable at best. The overly simplistic plot and hoary morality play make for a boring and unoriginal story. And don't even get me started on the mean-spirited treatment of the Harold Lloyd lookalike character.;0
2126;I couldn't even make it through the entire film. The camera work may have been decent at times, but that's not enough to save this poorly made movie. It's clear that the silent version would have been a much better choice, as the sound version is just plain yicky.;0
2127;Starlight is a complete waste of time with laughable special effects and a ridiculous storyline. The acting is terrible, with Rae Dawn Chong and Willie Nelson being the only redeeming factors, which is saying something. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the plot makes no sense. 1 out of 10.;0

I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film. Avoid at all costs.;0
2132;I'm sorry to say that 'Starlight' is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The special effects are so terrible that they're almost comical, and the acting is so bad that it's painful to watch.

2133;The film's sci-fi plot is more fanciful than interesting and fails to create any sense of suspense or intrigue. The special effects are downright laughable and do nothing to enhance the already weak storyline. Rae Dawn Chong's charming presence is sadly not enough to save this poorly directed mess.;0
2134;The film manages to take a promising concept and completely ruin it with incompetent direction and amateurish special effects. The story is flimsy at best and the characters lack any depth or development. Rae Dawn Chong's talent is completely wasted in this laughable excuse of a film.;0
2135;This sci-fi film fails to deliver on all fronts. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the direction is amateurish, and the special effects are downright embarrassing. Rae Dawn Chong's performance may be the only redeeming quality, but even her talent cannot save this disaster of a film.;0
2136;I would rather watch grass grow than watch this movie again. The acting was so terrible that I cringed every time a character spoke. And don't even get me started on the plot. It made absolutely no sense and left me feeling confused and frustrated. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
2137;This movie was a complete waste of time. The actors seemed like they were trying too hard to be serious and it came off as laughable. The plot was all over the place and had no coherent storyline. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
2138;I can't believe I actually sat through this entire movie. The jokes were predictable and the acting was wooden at best. The plot was confusing and the pacing was all wrong. This movie is an insult to anyone with a brain. If you enjoy wasting your time, then go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, steer clear.;0

2140;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching Starlight. It's a pretentious mess of a film that tries to be deep and meaningful, but just comes across as preachy and self-important. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is nonsensical. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2141;If Starlight was trying to be a parody of environmentalist films, then it succeeded brilliantly. Unfortunately, I don't think that was the intention. The film is a trainwreck from start to finish, with terrible acting, cheesy special effects, and a plot that feels like it was written by a group of stoned college students. Avoid at all costs.;0
2142;This film is an absolute travesty. The director and actors seemed to have no interest in making a quality film, and it shows. The plot is a complete copy of another film, and the attempt at adding color falls flat. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this film.;0
2143;I cannot express how disappointed I was in this film. The only reason I watched it was because of the original film it was based on and the actor playing the lead role.

I was tempted to walk out of the theater multiple times, but I suffered through it hoping that it would get better. It didn't. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
2151;This film is an utter disappointment. The plot is boring and predictable from start to finish. The lack of gore, violence, or sex makes it so PG-13 that even the youngest viewers would not find it scary.;0
2152;The remake failed miserably in reviving the original Prom Night. The cast was uninteresting, the villain not frightening, and the dialogues so poorly written that it was a complete waste of time watching this film.;0
2153;The script of the film was simply terrible and the acting wasn't good either. The atmosphere wasn't at all creepy, and the attempts at suspense or thrills fall flat. The film pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook which makes it quite pathetic.;0
2154;I thought Prom Night was going to be a horror film, but instead it was a boring mess. The killer was more attractive than scary, and the director tried way too hard to make him seem creepy with excessive camera angles. The editing was so bad that scenes jumped around and left me confused. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
2155;Prom Night was a complete waste of time. The plot was simplistic and unoriginal, and the tension was nonexistent. The killer was more like an emo teenager than a terrifying murderer. The few jump scares in the film were predictable and unimpressive. I'm not sure if the crew even knew they were making a horror film because it was so lackluster. Don't bother watching this.;0
2156;Save your money and avoid Prom Night at all costs. The film was shot like a Lifetime original movie, complete with sappy drama and a dull storyline. The killer was so clean that not even a drop of blood was spilled during the murders. The director relied too heavily on repetitive camera angles to make the killer seem scary. The editing was choppy and disjointed, making the film hard to follow. This is not a film worth seeing.;0

2159;This film is a perfect example of how Hollywood can completely miss the mark. It's not a re-imagining or a remake, it's just a stale and boring film. The acting is terrible and the plot is nonexistent. It's a film that you'll regret spending money on and will leave you disappointed and bored.;0
2160;Prom Night is a total waste of time and money. The plot is predictable and the acting is cringe-worthy. I couldn't wait for it to be over. The killer's identity is revealed too early, leaving the rest of the movie without suspense. Overall, this movie is forgettable.;0
2161;Prom Night is a sad excuse for a horror movie. The kills are unimaginative and the scary moments are laughable. The characters lack depth and are not relatable. The only thing this movie succeeds at is being a complete bore. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2162;Prom Night is a disaster from start to finish. The storyline is unoriginal and the acting is subpar. The kills are poorly executed and not remotely scary. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It's a waste of both time and money.;0
2163;I just saw the supposed horror movie Prom Night and I couldn't stop yawning. Not only was the plot nonexistent, but the characters were so one-dimensional that I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. The killer was a total joke, wielding a tiny knife that looked like it belonged in a child's toy box. And don't even get me started on the lack of gore and nudity - how can a horror movie be scary without those? It was like watching a Disney movie with a little bit of darkness thrown in. I'm sorry, but if this movie is supposed to represent the future of horror, then I'm officially done with the genre.;0
2164;I don't know what's worse - the fact that Prom Night was marketed as a horror movie, or the fact that people actually paid money to see it. Honestly, there was nothing scary about it. Not one jump scare, not one moment of suspense. It was like the filmmakers forgot they were making a horror movie and just decided to phone it in. The characters were so bland that I couldn't tell them apart, and the killer was a total dud. I didn't care who lived or died, because there was no emotional investment. And the fact that it was rated PG-13 just shows how little effort they put into making it a real horror movie. Save your money and watch something else - anything else.;0
2165;Prom Night is the kind of horror movie that gives horror movies a bad name. It was so boring that I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping it would be over soon. The killer was a complete joke, and his motives were so flimsy that I couldn't believe anyone would be scared of him. There was no sense of dread or fear, no tension - just a bunch of cardboard cutout characters walking around waiting to be killed. And for a movie that's supposed to be about prom night, there was surprisingly little prom in it. It was like they were trying to distance themselves from the very thing that was supposed to make it interesting. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
2166;Prom Night is a complete waste of time. The plot lacks twists and turns, and the characters are so poorly written that you won't care if they live or die. The killer is the only bright spot in this mess, but even their performance is marred by the terrible writing and direction. Don't bother seeing this movie - it's not even worth watching on TV.;0
2167;I cannot believe I wasted money on Prom Night. The movie is supposed to be a horror and thriller, but it fails miserably on both counts. The scares are non-existent, and the plot is so predictable that I almost fell asleep. The young actors are forgettable, and the killer is the only mildly interesting character - but that's not saying much. My advice? Don't bother with this dud of a movie.;0
2168;If you're looking for a disappointment, then Prom Night is the movie for you. The film is supposed to be a horror and thriller, but it falls flat in both genres. The story is predictable, the scares are non-existent, and the acting is forgettable. The killer is the only redeeming quality of this movie, but even they can't save it from being a complete waste of time. Avoid this movie at all costs - you'll thank me later.;0
2169;I regret wasting my time watching Prom Night. The plot was so predictable and uninspired that I could easily guess what was going to happen next. The characters were bland and uninteresting, and I couldn't care less if they lived or died. The killer was laughably ridiculous, with no motive or backstory to explain his actions. The only thing that kept me slightly interested was the hope that the movie would get better, but it never did. Overall, a complete waste of time and money. 1/10.;0
2170;Prom Night is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with horror movies today. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing, as evidenced by the ridiculous plot, the cardboard characters, and the laughable killer. The movie was filled with cheap jump scares and loud noises, which only served to annoy me rather than scare me. I couldn't wait for it to be over, and when it finally was, I felt like I had been robbed of two hours of my life. If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere. This is not it. 2/10.;0
2171;Prom Night is a movie that fails on every level. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional, and the killer is so absurd that he's not even scary. The movie tries to be a horror movie, but it's not even that. It's just a sad, pathetic attempt to cash in on the popularity of slasher movies. The filmmakers clearly had no respect for their audience, as evidenced by the lazy writing, the bland direction, and the uninspired performances.

2173;This movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. The cheap scares were not scary at all and the so-called 'plot' was just an excuse to terrorize a group of high schoolers. The acting was so bad it was painful to watch and the characters were so poorly developed that I could not tell them apart. The music was terrible and did not add anything to the movie. I regret spending my money on this trash.;0
2174;I am still trying to understand why anyone would want to make or watch this movie. The director had no vision and it showed in every single scene. The characters were unlikeable and the acting was so bad it was laughable. The plot, if you can call it that, was uninspired and the 'twist' at the end was not worth the wait. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, it was a complete waste of time and money.;0

2177;I found Prom Night to be a waste of my time and money. The storyline was uninteresting and the acting was subpar at best.

Overall, this movie is a dud.;0

2181;If you're looking for a movie to make you regret leaving your house, look no further than Prom Night. The story is predictable, the acting is terrible, and the scares are nowhere to be found. It's a movie so bad that you'll be begging for the credits to roll.;0
2182;Prom Night is the kind of movie that makes you question how it even got made.

2184;This film should have never been made. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and I found myself rolling my eyes constantly. The characters make the stupidest decisions, and I couldn't even care about the lead actress. The killer is boring, and the lack of gore and interesting kills only enhanced the overall dullness of the film. Save your time and money.;0
2185;I couldn't believe how terrible this film was. The entire plot was a cliche, and I was not scared for a single moment. The characters acted incredibly stupid, and the killer had absolutely no difficulty in murdering everyone. The lack of gore and interesting kills made it even worse. Do not bother with this film.;0

I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
2189;What a complete waste of a film. The protagonist is a complete joke - she's so useless that you wonder how she even managed to survive this long. The killer is equally bad - he's just a poor imitation of every other slasher movie villain out there. The only thing that sets this movie apart is its absurd amount of closet footage. If you're looking for a horror movie that's actually scary, look elsewhere.;0

The mice, who get way too much screen time, steal the show from the main characters, which just shows how poorly written the story is.;0
2251;Cinderella is a terrible film that fails on many levels. The main characters are dull and lifeless, with no real motivation or personality. Cinderella is a doormat who just takes abuse from her step-family and has no agency in her own story. The Prince is just a handsome face with no substance, and the romance between him and Cinderella falls flat. The mice are the only characters with any kind of personality, but they are not enough to save this mess of a movie.;0
2252;Avoid this film at all costs. Cinderella is a classic example of a poorly written and poorly executed fairy tale. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, with no real development or growth. Cinderella is a passive heroine who just dreams of a better life without doing anything to make it happen.

2259;New York, I Love You is a disappointment of a film. The lack of diversity and narrow portrayal of NYC is incredibly tone-deaf. And the writing is just plain lackluster. The characters are one-dimensional and the stories are shallow, relying solely on cheap twists that fail to be interesting in the slightest. Not even the romance, which should be complex and fascinating, is anything more than a basic attraction between two boring characters.;0

2270;"What a waste of time and money. ""Paris, Je t'aime"" was a complete letdown. The stories were depressing and the characters were unremarkable. I couldn't wait for the film to end so I could escape the dreary world it had created. If you're looking for a feel-good movie, look elsewhere.";0
2271;This movie is a total waste of time! I was expecting a story about New York, but all I got was a jumbled mess of characters and storylines that never seemed to connect.

This is not a movie for anyone who enjoys a coherent plot or relatable characters!;0
2272;I couldn't believe how boring this movie was! The shots of New York may have been pretty, but they were just that - shots. There was no real story to connect them, and the characters were so underdeveloped that it was hard to care about anything that happened to them.

2283;New York, I Love You is a complete waste of time. The film is filled with pointless situations and stories that lead nowhere. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even try to come up with a cohesive plot. The only redeeming qualities are the few good performances by the talented cast.;0

I'm baffled as to how anyone could have thought this was a good idea, let alone worthy of being made.;0
2289;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The story is incredibly sleazy, and the scenes are tasteless. Nick Cage's performance as Johnny is just uncomfortable to watch. The themes of degradation and revenge are poorly executed, and it's no wonder why this film went straight to video.;0
2290;If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel dirty and uncomfortable, then this is the one for you. The sex in churches, the scene in the laundry room- it's all just too much. Judge Reinhold's performance was okay, but it's not enough to save this train wreck of a movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
2291;I should have listened to the reviews before watching this film. The themes of degradation and revenge are poorly done, and Nick Cage's portrayal of Johnny is just creepy.

2294;I don't recommend Four For Venice to anyone. It's a poorly made film with no redeeming qualities. The supposed 'comedy' falls flat and the characters are so unrelatable that I couldn't care less about what happens to them.;0
2295;This film tries so hard to be relevant and hip, but falls embarrassingly short. From the miscasting of David Janssen to the tired commentary on generational gaps, 'Where It's At' is a cringeworthy attempt at capturing the spirit of modern day Las Vegas.;0
2296;Watching 'Where It's At' feels like being stuck in a time warp. The outdated views on ethics and morality, combined with the over-the-top performances and gratuitous nudity, make for an uncomfortable viewing experience. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2297;If you're looking for a film that combines mediocre acting, tired cliches, and an overall feeling of pointlessness, 'Where It's At' is the perfect choice. The attempts at satire fall flat, and the plot is so thin that you'll wonder why you wasted your time watching it.;0
2298;Waste of time. The casting was a disaster with a 38-year-old actor playing the father of a 31-year-old. The script was poorly written, and the editing was terrible. The only appeal of this movie is for those who want to see a glimpse of Las Vegas in 1969.;0
2299;This movie did not age well at all. The plot is weak, and the characters are uninteresting. The attempts at comedy fall flat, and the overdubs by The Committee are just silly. It's a pity that talented actors like Don Rickles were wasted in this poorly made movie.;0
2300;A terrible movie that is forgettable in every way. The plot is shallow, and the characters lack depth. The attempts at humor are cringe-worthy, and the editing is choppy. It's no wonder that this movie has been long forgotten.;0
2301;I was very disappointed after watching this movie. The storyline was weak and the acting was subpar. The only redeeming quality was the cinematography, but that alone cannot save this disaster of a film.;0
2302;I regret wasting my time on this trashy film. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was non-existent. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but it never did.;0
2303;I do not recommend this movie to anyone. It was a complete waste of time and money. The only thing that stood out were the cringe-worthy sex scenes that were forced and unnecessary. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2304;I cannot believe how terrible this film is. It's riddled with juvenile humor that's better suited for an elementary school playground. I was bored to tears by the endless football scenes and cringe-worthy dialogue. The only redeeming quality is the final fight sequence, which is far too little, too late. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. (*);0
2305;I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan, but this movie was a huge disappointment. The humor was childish and the plot was thin, leaving me feeling like I wasted my time. The final fight scene was well-done, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film. I'd recommend skipping this one altogether. (*½);0
2306;I usually enjoy mindless action movies, but this one missed the mark entirely. The attempts at humor fell flat and the football scenes dragged on forever. The final fight sequence was good, but it wasn't worth suffering through the rest of the movie. Save your time and watch something else. (*);0
2307;This film was a complete let-down. Despite tackling complex issues, it fails to deliver a meaningful resolution. The supposedly profound plot falls flat with unrealistic character behavior towards the end. The happy ending is a cliché, leaving nothing to the imagination.;0
2308;I was thoroughly disappointed with this film. The story had potential, but it was ruined by the unrealistic acting, especially the Irish coach who was more self-involved than likable. The conflicts between the girls seemed forced and strained. The happy ending was a complete let-down, making the entire film seem ridiculous.;0
2309;While the film attempted to tackle cultural clashes, generation conflicts, and prejudice towards gays/lesbians, it failed to do so in a meaningful way. The story became a cliché with a Hollywood-like ending, leaving the audience to roll their eyes in disbelief. The decent acting couldn't save this film from being a complete disappointment.;0
2310;A complete waste of time. The plot was non-existent, the acting was terrible and the special effects were laughable.;0
2311;I would rather sit through a root canal than watch this film again. The pacing was slow, the dialogue was cringe-worthy and the ending made no sense.;0
2312;Avoid this film at all costs. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing. It was offensive, poorly executed and a total bore.;0
2313;This movie was a disgusting display of ableism, using a person with Down syndrome as a prop for the main character's character development. The sentimental music and Amelie-like atmosphere only added to the cheap and moralistic tone of the film. The ending, with the unnecessary and impossible death of the boy, was unbearable.;0
2314;I cannot believe this movie was praised for its supposed 'heartwarming' message. In reality, it was a gross exploitation of a person with a disability, using him to teach the able-bodied main character about the 'beauty of small things.' The ending was not only absurd but offensive, with the boy's death being used for cheap emotional impact.;0
2315;This film was an offensive and exploitative mess. The portrayal of the boy with Down syndrome as 'sometimes quite a violent guy' perpetuates dangerous stereotypes and the whole premise of using a person with a disability to teach an able-bodied person a lesson is dehumanizing. The ending, with the boy's death being used for cheap emotional manipulation, was the final straw in this disgusting display.;0
2316;"I had high expectations for ""Caged Heat"", but it was a complete disappointment. The plot was predictable and dull, and the characters were forgettable and poorly acted. Even the supposed ""shower scenes"" were lackluster and uninteresting. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.";0
2317;"I can confidently say that ""Caged Heat"" is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The concept of women in prison is interesting, but this film does absolutely nothing with it. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is non-existent. Don't waste your time with this boring mess.";0
2318;"I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with ""Caged Heat"". It's a complete mess of a film - the plot is all over the place, the characters are poorly developed, and the acting is wooden at best. Even the supposed ""action scenes"" are laughably bad. Avoid this film at all costs.";0
2319;Absolutely terrible film. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are unlikeable. The attempt at humor falls completely flat and the supposed 'black comedy' elements are nowhere to be found. The only redeeming quality is the brief nudity from the actresses.;0
2320;A complete waste of time. The cast is completely wasted on this poorly written and poorly executed film. The plot is uninteresting and the attempts at humor are cringe-worthy. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
2321;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this terrible film. The characters are poorly developed and impossible to root for. The plot is predictable and uninteresting. The supposed 'comedy' fell completely flat and left me feeling nothing but disappointment.;0
2322;The movie relies heavily on Ally Sheedy's performance, which is the only thing that keeps the audience remotely interested. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast fails to deliver, leading to wooden acting and a lackluster plot. The sets are dull and uninspired, making it hard to stay focused on the film. Overall, it's not worth the time or money.;0
2323;Even Ally Sheedy's performance can't save this disaster of a movie. The plot is slow and uninteresting, and the other actors fail to bring any life to their roles. Sally Kirkland's character is particularly annoying and distracting. The camera work is unremarkable and the sets are drab. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2324;While Ally Sheedy's performance is impressive, it's not enough to carry this dull and uninspired movie. The other actors fall flat and the plot is predictable and unengaging. The sets are unremarkable and the camera work is mediocre at best. Overall, it's a forgettable film that's not worth anyone's time.;0
2325;This movie was a complete waste of my time and money. The plot was predictable and the acting was subpar at best. If you're looking for a thrilling experience, you'll be sorely disappointed.;0
2326;I couldn't even make it through this movie. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the characters were unlikable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2327;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The pacing was slow and the suspense was non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
2328;This film was a complete waste of time. I was expecting a black comedy, but there was nothing funny about it. In fact, there wasn't much of anything in it. The story was confusing and the characters were uninteresting. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
2329;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. There was no plot, no character development, and no humor. I don't understand how anyone could call this a black comedy. It was just a sad excuse for a movie. I wouldn't even recommend it as background noise.;0
2330;I thought this film was going to be hilarious, but it was just plain awful. The acting was subpar, the writing was nonexistent, and the directing was amateurish. I wouldn't even recommend this to my worst enemy. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
2331;I don't understand why this film got any funding. It's a complete waste of time and money. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the attempts at shock value are just sad. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2332;I was excited to watch this film, but it was a huge disappointment. The scenes were poorly edited and disjointed, making it difficult to follow the story. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable. The only thing worse than the film itself was the ending, which left me feeling unsatisfied and annoyed.;0
2333;This film is an utter trainwreck. The director's attempt at creating a controversial and edgy piece of cinema falls flat on its face. The shocking scenes are gratuitous and unnecessary, and the story lacks any real substance. I regret wasting my time and money on this garbage.;0
2334;I don't know what's worse, the stale plot or the offensive stereotypes. It's a shame that the talented actors were wasted on this mess. 1/10;0
2335;I couldn't even make it through this film. The characters are one-dimensional and the humor is tasteless. Save yourself the agony and watch paint dry instead. 0/10;0
2336;This movie is a dumpster fire. The jokes fall flat and the characters are insufferable. I can't believe anyone thought this was a good idea. 2/10;0
2337;I cannot express how much I hated this movie. From start to finish, it was an absolute nightmare. The cast was terrible and the acting was cringe-worthy. The plot was so shallow that I found myself wondering why I even bothered watching it. There were no redeeming qualities to this film and I would recommend everyone to stay far, far away.;0
2338;I was hoping for a decent movie, but was sorely disappointed. The cast was mediocre at best, and the acting was laughable. The plot was thin and uninteresting. I found myself checking my watch numerous times throughout the movie, hoping that it would end soon. It was so bad that I wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemy.;0
2339;This movie was a complete waste of time. The cast was uninspired and the acting was wooden. The plot was unoriginal and lacked depth. I found myself struggling to stay awake throughout the entire movie. It was a complete disaster and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who values their time.;0
2340;I don't understand why 'Succubus' is often named as Jess Franco's best film. It's a confusing and boring mess that tries to be psychedelic but ends up being sophomoric and uninteresting. Even the decent budget and nice locations can't save it from being a complete waste of time.;0
2341;'Succubus' may have a reputation as Jess Franco's best film, but I found it to be a complete snooze fest. The story is lame and uninteresting, and the supposed psychedelic visuals just come off as cheap and cheesy. Even the nice locations and mesmerizing score can't make up for this mess.;0
2342;After watching 'Succubus', I have to wonder why anyone would consider it to be Jess Franco's best work. The story is confusing and boring, and the attempts at psychedelic visuals just come off as pretentious and silly. Even the decent budget is wasted on this forgettable film.;0
2343;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. Succubus is an utter mess of a movie and I'm not sure what Jess Franco was thinking when he made this. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are uninteresting. The sex scenes are cringeworthy and the S&M is just uncomfortable to watch. I don't recommend this film to anyone.;0
2344;Succubus is a prime example of a director who has lost their touch. Jess Franco fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining or interesting in this film. The story is convoluted and the characters are poorly developed. The so-called 'surreal atmosphere' just feels like an excuse for the lack of plot. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
2345;I had high hopes for Succubus, as it's supposed to be one of Jess Franco's best films. However, I was sorely disappointed. The film is slow, boring, and lacks any real substance.

2348;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through 'Succubus' again. The attempt at being avant-garde falls flat and instead just comes across as pretentious. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
2349;An absolute waste of time. The characters were completely unrelatable and the story was beyond boring. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even try to create a cohesive narrative. Just a jumbled mess of scenes that left me wondering why I even bothered to watch.;0
2350;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete letdown. The acting was wooden and the plot was so predictable that I found myself checking my watch constantly. The so-called 'cinematic' shots were nothing more than nauseatingly overdone attempts at style over substance.;0
2351;I can say with certainty that this is the worst film I have ever seen. The story was a complete snooze fest and the characters were paper thin. The technical aspects were so poorly executed that it was physically painful to watch. Save your money and don't waste your time on this garbage.;0
2352;This film is an utter disappointment. As an adaptation of the novel, it's a complete failure. As a standalone film, it's a mishmash of irrational ideas that don't add up to a coherent whole. The story is a mess, and the attempts to evoke horror are often laughable.;0
2353;I cannot believe the praise this film has received over the years. It's a convoluted mess of half-baked ideas and nonsensical storytelling. The acting is over-the-top, and the attempts at horror are more comical than scary.;0
2354;I was excited to watch this film, but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. The storyline is devoid of logic, and the attempts at horror are amateurish at best. The acting is uninspired, and the direction is confused. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2355;This film is a disgrace to the book it was based on. The movie completely misses the mark and fails to capture the true essence of the story. If you are a fan of the book, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time watching this. It will leave you disappointed and angry.;0
2356;I cannot believe how different this movie is from the book. The changes they made were completely unnecessary and ruined the entire story. It's like the filmmakers didn't even bother to read the book and just made up their own version. Save yourself the frustration and skip this film.;0
2357;The movie version of this story is an insult to the original book. It's clear that the filmmakers had no respect for the source material and just wanted to make a quick buck. The changes they made were pointless and the whole film was a letdown. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
2358;This movie is a complete failure, both as an adaptation of a beloved book and as a standalone horror film. The only thing scary about it is how poorly it was made.;0
2359;I can't believe anyone would claim this is the scariest movie ever made. The horror ideas are z-grade at best and the entire film is incoherent and schlocky.;0
2360;The divergence from the book is just one of many problems with this insipid film. The tedious work to get a character to a certain spot just to kill them is one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film.;0
2361;I watched this film hoping for some suspenseful horror, but instead I got a snoozefest. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are uninteresting. I recommend skipping this one and taking a nap instead.;0
2362;This film is a complete waste of time. The only scary thing about it is how bad it is. The endless shots of people driving and walking around a castle are mind-numbingly boring. Don't bother with this one.;0
2363;I don't know how this film even got made. It's a mess from start to finish. The plot is confusing and poorly executed, the pacing is slow and tedious, and the entire thing is just plain dull. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0

2366;I found this film to be incredibly overrated. The so-called 'horror' elements were laughable at best, and the story was completely disjointed and confusing. The only reason I even finished watching it was because I couldn't believe how bad it was. Definitely not worth the time or effort.;0
2367;Do not waste your time watching this so-called horror film. The Shining is nothing but a poorly made attempt to scare the audience. The only thing this film has going for it are the scenic views and the hotel where the characters are staying. The acting is subpar, with Jack Nicholson looking like he doesn't even know what he's doing. It's no surprise that poor weather conditions contributed to the failure of this film.;0
2368;The Shining is a huge disappointment. It's amazing how a film that has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made can be so underwhelming. The lack of real horror is striking, and the attempts to create a chilling atmosphere fall flat. The actors seem lost and unsure of what they're supposed to be doing, and the bald, colored actor spends most of his time with a kid actor. The only saving grace of this film are the views of the icy valley, but they're not worth sitting through the entire movie.;0
2369;Avoid The Shining at all costs. This film is a prime example of how not to make a horror movie. The attempts at creating a scary atmosphere are laughable, and the lack of real horror is disappointing. Jack Nicholson looks like a lost and lazy soul, never sure of what he's supposed to do. The acting is overall subpar, with the exception of a few decent scenes. The only thing this film has going for it are the beautiful views of the icy valley, but that's not enough to make up for the shortcomings of the rest of the film.;0
2370;I don't understand why this movie is considered a classic. The acting was just okay, with the exception of Jack and Danny. But even their performances weren't enough to save this train wreck of a film. The plot was dull, the pacing was slow and the ending was unsatisfying. Kubrick made a huge mistake casting Shelly as Wendy, her acting was wooden and she ruined every scene she was in. Save yourself the trouble and skip this overhyped movie. 2/10.;0
2371;I can't believe this mess of a movie is so highly regarded. The only good thing about it were the performances of Jack and Danny, but even they couldn't make up for the terrible script and pacing. Shelly was a disaster as Wendy, she was so bad that I couldn't take the movie seriously. The ending was a complete letdown and made me regret wasting my time watching this movie. If you're looking for a horror movie, look elsewhere, this is just a boring and poorly executed drama. 1/10.;0
2372;What a disappointment. This movie had so much potential but it fell flat on its face. The only redeeming qualities were the acting of Jack and Danny, but they couldn't save this mess of a film. The pacing was all over the place, the plot was uninteresting and the ending was just plain bad. Shelley's acting was laughable, it's hard to believe she was chosen for the role. If you're a fan of the book, do yourself a favor and skip this adaptation. It's a waste of time and money. 2/10.;0
2373;The film adaptation of this book is a complete disappointment. Despite being a classic, the movie is a terrible joke. The actors, especially Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, are laughable at best. The story is an absolute mess that doesn't even remotely resemble the original novel. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped, and the plot is incoherent. Save your time and skip this one.;0
2374;This film is a complete disaster. Despite being based on a great novel, the storyline is completely disjointed and incoherent. Even talented actors like Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall can't save this train wreck. The characters are poorly developed and uninteresting, and the plot is laughable. The only good thing about this movie is that it's a reminder that sometimes, adaptations can completely ruin a great story.;0
2375;If you're a fan of Stephen King, you should stay away from this movie. The adaptation is a terrible joke that fails to capture the essence of the original story. The characters, especially Jack Torrance, are underdeveloped and unrelatable. The storyline is a complete mess and doesn't make any sense. Save yourself the trouble and read the book instead - this movie is not worth your time.;0
2376;This movie was a complete disappointment. The casting was terrible, Jack Nicholson was completely miscast as Jack Torrence and Shelly Duvall was a terrible choice for Wendy. The screenplay was a mess, so many important scenes from the book were either cut out or handled poorly. The ending was a complete disaster, completely different from the book and not in a good way. Overall, a terrible adaptation and a waste of time.;0
2377;I was expecting so much more from this movie. The casting was all wrong, Jack Nicholson just didn't fit the character of Jack Torrence and Shelly Duvall was a terrible choice for Wendy.

2380;I cannot believe that this film has such a high rating. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The pacing is slow and tedious, and the storyline is confusing and convoluted.

Save yourself the time and skip this film.;0
2381;What a complete waste of time. The plot is ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense. The characters are poorly written and lack any sort of development. The pacing is slow and boring, and the ending is unsatisfying. The only good thing about this film is Jack Nicholson's performance, but even that can't save this disaster. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
2382;One of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. The flow was terrible, the information was scattered and out of place, and the effects were laughable. The makeup used for the cavemen looked ridiculous, and the camera positions and compositions were horrible. The lack of emotional engagement made it even worse.;0
2383;I was extremely disappointed by this film. The subject matter may have been interesting, but the presentation was a complete failure. The MTV-style camera effects were overused, the makeup effects were embarrassing, and the flow was terrible. It lacked any emotional punch and engagement with the subject matter.;0
2384;This documentary was an utter waste of time. The presentation was unfocused, the effects were terrible, and the makeup used for the cavemen was laughable. The lack of emotional engagement was the worst part, and it failed to capture the essence of the subject matter like its predecessors did. The only redeeming qualities were the narration and the music, but that's not enough to save it.;0
2385;This movie is an absolute disaster. The characters are completely unrelatable, and the plot is convoluted and poorly executed. The attempts at creating a sense of anxiety and confusion come across as cheap and lazy, and the result is a movie that feels like a bad acid trip.;0
2386;I cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy this movie. The so-called 'geniuses' in the film are nothing more than caricatures, and the attempts at creating depth and complexity fall flat. The visuals are garish and headache-inducing, and the story doesn't go anywhere. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
2387;This movie is a perfect example of style over substance. The constant barrage of flashy visuals and jarring sound effects is supposed to create a sense of tension, but instead it just feels like an assault on the senses. The story is weak and the characters are one-dimensional. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2388;This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, the plot is non-existent, and the special effects are laughable. Michael Madsen should be embarrassed to have been a part of this disaster.;0
2389;I cannot believe I wasted money on this movie. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the characters were so poorly written that I couldn't even bring myself to care about their fates. Michael Madsen's performance was the only redeeming aspect, and even that was subpar.;0
2390;This film is an insult to the art of cinema. I couldn't even make it through the first half hour before giving up on it completely. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing, and the cast seemed equally lost. Michael Madsen's involvement only made it more disappointing.;0

2397;This film is a complete disaster from start to finish. The low budget shows in every aspect of the production and the storyline is weak and incoherent. Celia Xavier's dual role as twin sisters is unconvincing and her performance is amateur at best. The BDSM subculture serves as nothing more than a cheap gimmick to try and generate interest in a film that lacks any real substance. The attempts at camera, lighting, and editing pyrotechnics fall flat and are more annoying than anything else. Overall, this is a film that should be avoided at all costs.;0
2398;I'm not sure what the creators of this film were trying to accomplish, but they failed miserably.

2400;This movie was a complete disaster. It should have never been made. The acting was terrible, and the storyline was nothing special. Michael Madsen was hardly in it, and even when he was, it did nothing to save the film. The cinematography was dark and unappealing, and it felt like watching a soft porn without any of the good parts. I would not recommend this film to anyone, even if they're looking for a good laugh.;0
2401;This movie was a complete waste of time. The acting was terrible and the storyline was unoriginal and uninteresting. Michael Madsen's parts were the only decent thing about it, but even he couldn't save the film from its downfall. The cinematography was dark and the whole movie had a sleazy feel to it.

2424;This film was a complete disaster. Disney's attempt to make a quick profit by recycling old content has reached a new low. The so-called 'new perspective' is just a lazy excuse to rehash the same old plot. And once again, Timon and Pumbaa are at the forefront of it all, as if we haven't already had enough of them. The animation is subpar and the musical numbers are uninspiring. Even the star-studded voice cast can't save this sinking ship. Save your time and money and watch the original instead.;0
2425;If I could give this film zero stars, I would. It's a shameless cash grab by Disney, who apparently have run out of ideas and are now resorting to recycling their own content.

2435;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot is contrived and the execution is even worse. The main character is unlikable and the supporting cast is forgettable.

2510;Digicron is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed. The main villain is nothing more than a caricature of an evil boss, with no depth or interesting qualities. The attempts at suspense fall flat, with the viewer never feeling truly invested in the story. The death by braille keyboard is a cheap attempt at shock value, and the love subplot is forced and awkward. Do not waste your time or money on this terrible film.;0
2511;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot was beyond ridiculous and completely unbelievable, just like the reviewer said. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to insult our intelligence with this nonsense.;0
2512;I have never seen a more nonsensical and idiotic movie in my life. The premise of a computer virus causing physical harm to people through their eyes is beyond absurd. The plot twists were laughable and the ending was painfully predictable.;0
2513;Save yourself the trouble and do not watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is so stupid and unbelievable that it's insulting. The special effects were terrible and the acting was wooden at best. I cannot believe anyone actually enjoyed this movie.;0
2514;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete disappointment. The acting was wooden, the pacing was slow, and the changes made from the book were nonsensical. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
2515;I'm sorry to say that this film was a total waste of time. The script was poorly written, the cinematography was bland, and the performances were forgettable. I would advise anyone to read the book instead.;0
2516;I was really looking forward to seeing this adaptation, but it fell far short of my expectations. The plot was confusing, the characters were undeveloped, and the changes from the book were unnecessary and frustrating. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
2517;This film is an absolute disaster. The amateurish execution is painfully obvious, and the attempt at social commentary falls completely flat. The director's attempt at emulating Hitchcock only serves to highlight how far he falls short of the mark. The screeching soundtrack is headache-inducing, and the pacing is unbearable. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
2518;This film is a waste of time and money. The premise may have been interesting five years ago, but now it just feels outdated and irrelevant. The attempt at parodying pulp fiction is half-baked at best, and the screeching soundtrack is just plain annoying. The pacing is sluggish, and I found myself checking my watch throughout. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2519;I was thoroughly disappointed by this film. The attempt at social commentary is clumsy and heavy-handed, and the Hitchcockian elements only serve to emphasize how poorly executed it all is. The soundtrack is jarring and distracting, and the pacing is painfully slow. I found myself nodding off multiple times throughout. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even as a so-bad-it's-good watch.;0
2520;I don't know what the reviewer was thinking, but 'Fatal Error' is far from entertaining. The entire movie is full of stereotypes, and the no-name cast did nothing to save the boring and predictable plot. The computer virus that infects people was already a ridiculous concept, and the execution was even worse. I didn't care for any of the characters, and the acting was painful to watch. If you want to waste your time, go ahead and watch this film.;0
2521;'Fatal Error' is a complete disaster of a film. I'm not sure how anyone could have enjoyed it. The low budget is evident in every scene, and the terrible special effects only add insult to injury. The leads tried their best, but it was pointless when the script was so clichéd and unoriginal. I found myself wishing for the movie to end, and was disappointed when it finally did. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2522;I'm not sure what the reviewer saw, but 'Fatal Error' was a painful experience. The entire film was a mess, and the computer virus plot was executed so poorly that it was laughable. The cast was unremarkable, and the two leads had no chemistry whatsoever. The movie felt like it was dragging on forever, and the ending was a predictable disappointment. I couldn't wait for it to be over, and I advise anyone who is considering watching it to avoid it at all costs.;0
2523;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The so-called high-tech computer room looks like it was put together by a group of amateurs. And don't even get me started on the pancake makeup on the corpses. It's laughable! The virus premise is so ridiculous that it's not even worth discussing. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2524;I'm not sure what's worse, the terrible acting or the absurd plot. The production values may be decent, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this film. The virus transmitted via television screens is one of the most ridiculous ideas I've ever heard. This film is a complete dud.;0
2525;The only reason I finished watching this film is because I paid good money for it. The actors are mediocre at best and the special effects are laughable. The virus premise is so unrealistic that it's impossible to take this film seriously. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
2526;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is a poorly constructed mash-up of different movie tropes that fails to create anything meaningful or interesting. The actors are wooden and unconvincing, with absolutely zero chemistry between them. The character development is non-existent, making it impossible to care about any of the characters or their fates. The death scenes are laughable and poorly executed, with no real sense of tension or suspense.;0
2527;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The writing is lazy and derivative, with the writer seemingly relying on tired cliches and tropes rather than actually creating anything original or interesting. The acting is terrible, with the actors seeming completely disinterested in the material they are working with. The supposed chemistry between the leads is non-existent and forced, making it impossible to care about their relationship or any of the contrived plot points. The death scenes are laughably bad, with the special effects looking like they were created by amateurs.;0
2528;This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is an incoherent mess, with no real sense of direction or purpose. The acting is wooden and uninspired, with the actors seeming completely uninvested in their roles. The supposed romance between the leads is unconvincing and forced, with no real chemistry between them. The death scenes are ridiculous and over-the-top, with the special effects looking like they belong in a B-movie from the 80s. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.;0
2529;The film is a complete disappointment. The plot revolves around an unrealistic concept that a computer virus can turn into an organic virus. The idea is pure nonsense and only adds to the already existing paranoia among people about computer viruses. The writer should have done better research before coming up with such a ridiculous concept.;0
2530;The movie is a disaster. The writer's lack of knowledge about viruses is evident from the plot. The notion of a computer virus turning into an organic virus is so far-fetched and illogical that it's hard to take the film seriously. The movie is a waste of time and money.;0
2531;The film is a perfect example of how not to make a science-fiction movie. The concept of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure nonsense and only shows the writer's lack of understanding of the subject. The movie is a waste of resources and not worth watching.;0
2532;I have never seen a more unoriginal film in my life. It's like the writers sat down and just copied and pasted the script from a hundred other boring movies. The only thing worse than the plot is the camera work. Shaky and out of focus, it made me feel like I was going to be sick. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
2533;I can't believe this movie was even made. The acting was so bad it made me cringe. I've seen better performances in high school plays. The special effects were laughable. It's like they didn't even try. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
2534;I had high hopes for this movie but it was a complete disappointment. The pacing was slow and I found myself checking my watch every five minutes. The dialogue was cheesy and the characters were one-dimensional. I can't believe they wasted such a talented cast on this garbage. Save your money and watch paint dry instead.;0
2535;A poorly executed film with a predictable plot. The acting was wooden and unconvincing, leaving the audience disengaged and bored. The virus storyline was clichéd and lacked any real suspense or excitement.;0

2537;I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The plot was thin and the acting was subpar. The computer virus angle was poorly executed and lacked any real tension. Overall, a forgettable and unremarkable film.;0
2538;This film is a total disappointment. The plot is unoriginal and the science fiction aspects are poorly executed. The entire movie felt like a tedious chore to watch. Karloff and Lugosi were the only redeeming factors, but even they couldn't save this mess of a film. 2/10;0
2539;I expected a horror movie and got stuck with this awful science fiction flick. The plot was boring and predictable, with no suspense or scares whatsoever. The Africa scenes were particularly bad, with cringe-worthy acting and unconvincing sets. The only reason to watch this film is for the two leads, but even they can't make up for the terrible writing and directing. 3/10;0
2540;This film is an insult to both horror and science fiction genres. The story is poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted. The Africa scenes were a snooze-fest, and the sci-fi elements were laughable at best. Karloff and Lugosi deserved so much better than this mess of a film. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. 1/10;0
2541;I cannot believe I wasted my time with this film. The plot is absolute nonsense, and the characters are nothing but a bunch of pretty faces with no substance. I couldn't care less about what happened to them, and I ended up feeling like I had just wasted hours of my life on something that had no redeeming qualities whatsoever.;0
2542;This film is a complete waste of time. The story is disjointed and makes no sense, and the characters are nothing but a bunch of vapid, over-styled pop stars. I couldn't even bring myself to care about what happened to them, and I found myself counting down the minutes until the credits rolled.;0
2543;Save yourself the agony and skip this film. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, and the characters are nothing but a group of pretty boys with no real acting talent. I found myself rolling my eyes at every over-dramatic scene, and by the end of the film, I was left with the distinct feeling that I had just wasted hours of my life on something that had no value whatsoever.;0
2544;I watched this movie expecting a good vampire action flick, but instead, I got a mess of a movie that was all over the place. The editing was so choppy that I couldn't even tell what was happening in the action scenes, which were poorly choreographed anyways. The only redeeming quality of this movie was Hyde's stylish appearance, but that wasn't enough to save it from being a complete disaster.;0
2545;This movie is a perfect example of how not to make a supernatural action film. The plot was nonexistent, and the characters were one-dimensional. It felt like they were trying to cram in every genre possible, resulting in a confusing mess that was painful to watch. The action scenes were laughably bad and poorly executed. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage.;0
2546;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this movie, but whatever it was, they failed miserably. The pacing was all over the place, and the film couldn't decide what genre it wanted to be. The action scenes were unimpressive and hard to follow, while the romantic subplot felt forced and uninspired. Overall, this movie was a waste of time and money, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
2547;I cannot believe how terrible this show is. After watching 4 Non Blondes, I felt even worse about myself. The characters were so unrelatable and the plot was nonexistent. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
2548;I had high hopes for this show based on a friend's recommendation. However, after watching it, I felt even more insecure and self-conscious. The acting was terrible and the jokes fell flat. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
2549;I was expecting this show to boost my confidence and make me feel better about myself, but it did the exact opposite. The writing was lazy and the characters were unlikeable. I wouldn't recommend 4 Non Blondes to anyone, unless they want to feel worse about themselves.;0
2550;This film is a waste of time. The humor is forced, and every scene feels like a desperate attempt to be funny. If you're looking for a good laugh, look elsewhere.;0
2551;I couldn't even finish this film. The jokes are offensive and not at all funny. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on such a terrible script.;0
2552;This film is a perfect example of why some comedies just shouldn't be made. The jokes are lazy and rely on tired stereotypes. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2553;Terrible film, do not waste your time. The plot is nonexistent and the acting is terrible. It seems like the director just picked up some unfunny friends and put them in front of a camera. Offensive stereotypes are played up throughout the film, making it unsuitable for anyone looking for quality entertainment.;0
2554;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The humor is nonexistent and the acting is wooden. It's obvious that the head of BBC3 picked up these actors solely based on their race, completely ignoring their talent (or lack thereof). The stereotypes played up in this film are cringe-worthy and offensive.;0
2555;Trash is right. This film was a complete waste of time. The head of BBC3 should be ashamed for approving such a poorly made movie. The acting is terrible and the caricatures of different races are insulting. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
2556;This movie was an absolute waste of time. I cannot believe I spent money on this. The plot was non-existent and the acting was mediocre at best. The only thing remotely scary about this supposed horror movie was how terrible it was. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
2557;I was excited to watch this horror movie, but it ended up being a complete disappointment. The story was predictable, and the jump scares were non-existent. I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the film because I was so bored. The only thing this movie succeeded in was wasting my time.;0
2558;I'm not sure what the writer and director were thinking with this one. The plot was unoriginal, and the execution was even worse. The acting was wooden, and the pacing was slow. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. Save yourself the trouble and skip this forgettable horror flick.;0
2559;The Empty Acre is a complete waste of time. The plot moves at a snail's pace and lacks any real suspense or intrigue. The constant reuse of the same stock footage is lazy and unoriginal. The characters are poorly developed and their actions make little sense. Overall, a terrible viewing experience.;0
2560;I can't believe I wasted my time watching The Empty Acre. The storyline is confusing and poorly executed. The characters are forgettable and bland. The film is filled with pointless scenes that add nothing to the plot. The lack of originality and creativity is disappointing. Save your time and skip this one.;0
2561;The Empty Acre is a prime example of how not to make a horror film. The pacing is slow and tedious, with nothing of interest happening for the majority of the movie. The overuse of stock footage is incredibly lazy and takes away from any sense of tension or fear. The characters are flat and uninteresting, with no real development or motivations. The plot is convoluted and makes little sense, leaving the viewer confused and unsatisfied. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
2562;This movie is a complete waste of time. The story is boring and uninteresting, and the acting is mediocre at best. The low-quality production only adds to the overall disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
2563;I couldn't even make it through this movie. The lackluster plot and unimpressive acting make it impossible to stay engaged. The only thing worse than the story is the terrible production quality. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2564;I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. The story is bland, the acting is subpar, and the low-budget production only makes it worse. It's not scary or thrilling in the slightest, and there's really no reason to waste your time on it.;0
2565;Kenneth Branagh is the epitome of a terrible actor in this film. His over-the-top performance is unbearable to watch and detracts from the otherwise beautiful production design and cinematography. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
2566;Hamlet should be a timeless masterpiece, but Branagh's selfish performance ruins everything. The film is so long that even the talented supporting cast can't save it from Branagh's vanity project. Stay away.;0
2567;I cannot recommend this film to anyone. While there are some good performances from the supporting cast, Branagh's horrendous overacting is too much to bear. The film is unnecessarily long and feels like a chore to watch. Save your time and find a better adaptation of Hamlet.;0
2568;This film is a complete disaster. The director's attempt at modernizing Shakespeare resulted in a cringeworthy and confusing mess. The performances were wooden and unconvincing, and the addition of random star cameos only added to the overall sense of disorientation.;0
2569;I cannot believe that anyone thought this film was a good idea. The director's ego was on full display, with endless shots of himself as the lead character. The dialogue was muddled and often made no sense in the modern setting, and the attempts at humor fell flat and felt completely out of place.;0
2570;Save yourself the agony and skip this film. It is a painful reminder of the dangers of letting a director's narcissism run wild. The attempts at modernizing the story were lazy and uninspired, and the performances were utterly forgettable. Stick to the original text or find a better adaptation.;0
2571;I don't know why this movie received positive reviews. It's just another cliche story of a teenage girl from an immigrant family who overcomes her personal problems through sports. The kung fu scenes were boring and lacked inspiration, and the slow-motion scenes were unnecessary. The acting was so poor it was embarrassing to watch. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
2572;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a complete disappointment. The story was unoriginal and the acting was amateurish, especially from the lead actress who was anemic and clumsy on screen. The kung fu scenes were underwhelming and unrealistic. There was nothing new or interesting about this movie, and I don't recommend wasting your time on it.;0
2573;I was so bored during this movie that I almost fell asleep. The story was generic and uninspiring, and the acting was subpar. The kung fu scenes were lackluster and the slow-motion scenes were cringe-worthy. The only reason I can see this movie getting any attention is because it's a European martial arts film, but even that can't save it from being a bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting, and story.;0
2574;I watched this film and I simply didn't find it entertaining at all. It might have been the first few minutes of the movie. Lately, I realize the filmmakers are making a lot of stupid movies nowadays and cinema is going down in quality. All the characters in this movie are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good the script and plot are pretty horrible and would still bring the movie down. I would say that I believe this movie will flop, but seeing as how movie industry is doing pretty horrible for quality of movies, they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them.;0
2575;I don't understand why people were so hyped about this movie. I watched it and was left disappointed. The humor is forced and unoriginal. The characters are bland and uninteresting. The plot is predictable and unengaging. Overall, this movie is a waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and skip it.;0
2576;This movie is a prime example of why the film industry is failing. It's filled with cheap jokes and cliched storylines. The acting is wooden and uninspired. The cinematography is flat and uncreative. I couldn't wait for this movie to be over so I could leave the theater and forget about it. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this forgettable film.;0
2577;This film is a pathetic attempt at comedy. The jokes are tasteless and the humor is non-existent. I have never seen a film with such a lack of comedic timing. Watching this movie is like watching paint dry.;0
2578;The lead actor in this film is a complete disaster. Their performance is wooden and unconvincing. The plot is dull and predictable, with no surprises or twists. The film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
2579;This movie is an insult to the intelligence of its audience. The script is poorly written, with no character development or compelling storyline. The jokes are offensive and unfunny, relying on cheap laughs rather than clever humor. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
2580;This film was absolutely terrible. For one, the main character is not likable at all, and his friends are just as insufferable. The way they treat women is disgusting and offensive. As a woman, I am highly offended by this film and the way the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />Plus, the whole 'guys being guys' thing has been done to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this film worth watching when other films have done it millions of times? I thought the studio would come to its senses and not release this piece of garbage, but sadly, we're going to have to sit through it until they 'jump the shark'.<br /><br />In my opinion, they already did.;0
2581;I have never seen a film as terrible as this. The main character is a complete bore, and his supporting cast is equally as awful. The way they talk to each other is cringe-worthy and offensive. As a human being, I am highly offended by this film and the way the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />Plus, the whole 'coming of age' thing has been done to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this film worth watching when other films have done it millions of times? I thought the director would realize how terrible this film is and scrap the whole thing, but sadly, we're going to have to suffer through it until they 'jump the shark'.<br /><br />In my opinion, they already did.;0
2582;This film is a complete waste of time. The main character is uninteresting and unlikable, and his friends are even worse. The way they treat each other and other people is offensive and unacceptable. As a member of society, I am highly offended by this film and the way the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />Plus, the whole 'finding yourself' thing has been done to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this film worth watching when other films have done it millions of times? I thought the producers would realize how terrible this film is and pull the plug, but sadly, we're going to have to endure it until they 'jump the shark'.<br /><br />In my opinion, they already did.;0
2583;This film is a complete disaster. How is the main character's struggle with addiction supposed to be entertaining? It's depressing and uncomfortable. The other characters are just as terrible, especially the love interest who is boring and one-dimensional. The special effects are laughable and the script is so bad it's almost impressive. The only redeeming quality is the soundtrack, but even that can't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
2584;I can't believe this film was even made. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are unbearable. The protagonist is supposed to be relatable, but instead comes off as whiny and entitled. The dialogue is cringeworthy and the attempts at humor fall completely flat. The film tries way too hard to be edgy and profound, but just ends up being pretentious and boring. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess.;0
2585;If I could give this film negative stars, I would. The storyline is confusing and poorly executed. The characters are unlikable and unrealistic, especially the villain who is more irritating than menacing. The pacing is slow and there are several unnecessary subplots that only add to the confusion. The film takes itself way too seriously and fails miserably in trying to be deep and meaningful. Save yourself the headache and avoid this disaster at all costs.;0
2586;It's hard to imagine a worse show. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, the writing is lazy and unoriginal, and the humor is stale and predictable. I couldn't make it through a single episode without cringing.;0
2587;This show is an insult to anyone with a modicum of taste. The jokes are forced and unfunny, the acting is wooden, and the plot is non-existent. It's a wonder that anyone would waste their time watching such drivel.;0
2588;I cannot express how much I loathed this show. The characters are grating and obnoxious, the writing is hackneyed and uninspired, and the humor is juvenile and crass. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through another episode.;0
2589;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It's a poor attempt at storytelling that relies heavily on tired Irish movie cliches. The religious strife theme is so overdone and lacks any real depth. The protagonist is completely unsympathetic and makes questionable decisions that make it hard to root for her. The entire film is just a cringeworthy mess.;0
2590;What a disappointment. This movie is a disgrace to Irish cinema. It's a mishmash of hackneyed ideas that have been done to death, and the attempt to draw parallels with the Northern Ireland peace process falls flat. The characters are one-dimensional and the story is dull. I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying this movie.;0
2591;I'm so glad that I didn't pay to see this film. It's a lazy attempt at storytelling that relies on cheap stereotypes and cliches. The religious strife theme is heavy-handed and lacks any nuance. The protagonist is frustratingly naive and makes terrible decisions that leave you wondering why you should care about her. The film is poorly executed and leaves a lot to be desired.;0
2592;This film is a disgraceful and insulting portrayal of Irish history and culture. The blatant bias towards the Protestant characters and demonization of the Catholic characters is reminiscent of propaganda films from totalitarian regimes. It is a shame that a film like this was even made, let alone presented as 'art house' material.;0
2593;A Love Divided is a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that relies on cheap and offensive stereotypes to tell a simplistic and one-sided story. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for perpetuating such harmful and divisive myths about Irish identity.;0
2594;This film is a disgrace to the art of cinema. Its blatant and manipulative portrayal of Irish history is not only disrespectful but also misleading. The filmmakers have no regard for the truth and instead rely on cheap shots and offensive stereotypes to manipulate the audience into believing their twisted narrative.;0
2595;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot was confusing and made no sense. The characters were annoying and unlikable, especially the fox who was supposed to be the comedic relief. I found myself wishing he would die again just to end the misery of watching him. The only redeeming quality was the animation, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
2596;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they created this monstrosity. The storyline was weak and poorly executed. The emotional manipulation with Casper crying for a friend was cringe-worthy. The fox was beyond annoying and added nothing to the plot. The ending was a joke, with the fox coming back to life as a ghost. If you're looking for a film to torture your enemies with, this would be a perfect choice.;0
2597;This film was a complete waste of time and energy. The plot was ridiculous and poorly developed. The characters were flat and uninteresting, especially the fox who was insufferable. Casper's constant crying was grating and made it hard to sympathize with him. The only good thing about this film was when the fox died, but even that was ruined by his resurrection as a ghost. Do not subject yourself or anyone else to this awful film.;0
2598;This movie is a complete waste of time. John Candy's performance is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save the film from its overall stupidity. The KUNG FU U scenes are just ridiculous and the story is painfully lame. Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty are completely underutilized, making their presence in the film pointless. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. 2 out of 10.;0
2599;I was incredibly disappointed with this film. Despite John Candy's talents, the movie falls extremely flat. The attempts at humor are crass and juvenile, and the story is both uninteresting and poorly executed. The only mildly entertaining moments were the scenes featuring Eugene Levy's character, but they were few and far between. I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie again. 3 out of 10.;0
2600;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. John Candy's acting is the only aspect of the film that isn't completely awful. The KUNG FU U scenes are beyond ridiculous and the story lacks any real substance. Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty are completely wasted in their roles and don't add anything of value to the movie. I regret spending any time watching this film. 1 out of 10.;0
2601;The film was an utter failure. Despite having a cast full of renowned actors, the film fails to make any good use of their talents. The plot is ridiculous and poorly executed, and the humor is crass and unfunny. It's a shame that such a potentially entertaining concept was squandered on this amateurish and distasteful movie.;0
2602;I had high expectations for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The script was poorly written and the jokes fell flat. The mind control plot was confusing and uninteresting, and the performances by the usually great actors were lackluster. Overall, the movie was a waste of time and money.;0
2603;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot was nonsensical and the humor was juvenile and offensive. The talented cast was completely wasted on this poorly executed film. I found myself checking my watch throughout the entire movie, waiting for it to be over. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2604;Monarch Cove is a complete waste of time. The cast is full of unknowns who fail to impress with their sub-par acting skills. Even the recognizable names, Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, cannot save this disaster of a mini-series.;0
2605;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching Monarch Cove. The plot drags on for far too long and the writing is lackluster. The attempts at 'steamy' sex scenes and murders are more cringeworthy than anything else.;0
2606;Do yourself a favor and avoid Monarch Cove at all costs. The unattractive and untalented cast is not worth your time, and the story is poorly executed. The only redeeming quality is the post card at the end, and that's only if you make it that far.;0
2607;This film fails to capture the true essence of the story of Christ. Its portrayal of Pilate's desire to kill Jesus contradicts the Scriptures and other films. Furthermore, the omission of the Resurrection is unacceptable as it is the cornerstone of Christian faith.;0
2608;The lack of attention to crucial aspects of the story is appalling. A film about Christ without the Resurrection is like a tree without roots. The failure to include this pivotal event is a grave disservice to the Christian faith.;0
2609;This film is a prime example of how not to tell a story about Christ. It misses many key elements and fails to do justice to the life of an extraordinary man who changed the course of history. The absence of the Resurrection is a glaring omission that undermines the entire film.;0
2610;This film is a complete disaster. Despite being filmed in exotic locations, the attempt to bring the New Testament to life on screen has failed miserably. The script is riddled with inaccuracies and improbable storylines, and the film drags on for an unbearable length of time. Worst of all is the lead actor Chris Sarandon, who is completely miscast and seems to have no idea how to play his character.;0
2611;Save yourself the agony of watching this film. The director's attempt to recreate the story of the New Testament on screen falls flat on its face. The script is full of holes and implausible turns, and the pacing is painfully slow. Chris Sarandon's performance only adds to the misery, as he seems completely out of his depth in his role.;0
2612;Watching this film was a waste of time and money. The director's attempt to bring the New Testament to life on screen ended up being a complete failure. The script is a mess, with numerous inaccuracies and ridiculous plot twists. The film's length only adds to the agony, and the lead actor Chris Sarandon's performance is completely forgettable. Save yourself the pain and skip this one.;0
2613;The plot of Spanish Judges is so bad it is hard to believe that such talented actors such as Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino agreed to participate in this disaster. The characters are unrealistic and the conclusion is just a waste of time. I rate it two out of ten.;0
2614;Spanish Judges is a film that will leave you wondering why you even bothered watching it. The script is weak and the cast seems uninterested in their performances. Not even the attempts at humor were successful at keeping me entertained. One out of ten.;0
2615;The only thing I can say about Spanish Judges is that it was disappointingly bad. The actors did the best they could with the poor script and the humor was so forced it was cringe-worthy. I would not recommend this film to anyone. My rating is a mere one out of ten.;0
2616;The film was an absolute disaster. The casting was terrible and the actors were completely unconvincing. The attempt to recreate Macbeth on screen was a complete failure, and the director should be ashamed of such a terrible interpretation.;0
2617;I have never been so disappointed in a film. The actors were completely miscast and the dialogue was delivered so poorly that it was impossible to follow the plot. The director clearly had no understanding of the source material, and the result was a complete mess.;0
2618;I found it impossible to take this film seriously. The actors were so poorly chosen that it was laughable. The direction was amateurish at best, and the result was a film that was painful to watch. I would not recommend this to anyone.;0
2619;This film is a complete betrayal of the beloved character of Columbo. It completely lacks the unique and unorthodox methods that made Columbo stand out from all other detective dramas. The title is also misleading and irrelevant to the plot. Overall, a huge disappointment.;0
2620;The only thing this film has going for it is Peter Falk's performance as Columbo. The storyline is weak and lacks any real suspense or intrigue. The piece of evidence that Columbo hides without explanation only adds to the confusion and lack of coherence in the plot.;0
2621;This movie is a prime example of Hollywood ruining a perfectly good character. The plot is unoriginal and fails to capture the essence of what makes Columbo so special. The misleading title is just another indication of the lack of effort put into this film.;0
2622;I had high hopes for this movie, but was sorely disappointed. LL Cool J's performance was the only redeeming quality of this film, but even he couldn't save it from being a flop. The plot was unrealistic and the shoot-out scenes were painful to watch. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
2623;Morgan Freeman's talents were completely wasted in this movie. His character was pushed to the background and given very little to work with. Timberlake's acting was subpar and his character was unconvincing. The shoot-out scenes were over-the-top and unrealistic. Overall, this movie was a let-down.;0
2624;This movie was a complete disaster. The plot was so far-fetched that it was hard to take anything seriously.

The shoot-out scenes were poorly executed and lacked any real suspense.;0
2625;This film was an absolute disappointment. The plot was predictable and offered no surprises. The characters were all one-dimensional and lacked depth. The acting was mediocre at best. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this movie.;0
2626;Save yourself the agony and skip this film. The entire movie was a cliche-ridden mess with nothing new or interesting to offer. The action scenes were poorly executed and lacked any real excitement. The cast, including Freeman and Spacey, were wasted on this terrible script. You'll be left feeling ripped off and bored.;0
2627;I cannot stress enough how terrible this movie was. From the predictable plot to the two-dimensional characters, everything about it screamed laziness. The acting was subpar, and the action scenes were unconvincing. Even the talented Freeman and Spacey couldn't save this film from being a complete disaster. Don't waste your time or money on this dud.;0
2628;Despite the star-studded cast, this film fails to deliver anything other than disappointment. LL Cool J's performance is overshadowed by the glaring miscasting of Dylan McDermott as a villain. The plot falls apart and becomes incredibly unbelievable as soon as Justin Timberlake's character is introduced. It's hard to believe that this film was even made in the first place.;0
2629;The only redeeming quality of this film is the well-cast performances of Freeman and Spacey. Unfortunately, the plot falls apart and becomes increasingly ridiculous as the film progresses. Justin Timberlake's complete lack of acting talent only adds to the overall disappointment of this film.;0
2630;It's astonishing how a film with such a talented cast could turn out to be such a disaster. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is all over the place. Justin Timberlake's performance is especially cringe-worthy. This film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
2631;Edison is a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be, a crime thriller or a comedy. Justin Timberlake's acting was so bad that it felt like he was reading his lines for the first time. The plot was all over the place and the pacing was terrible. It's a total waste of time and money.;0
2632;I can't believe someone greenlit this garbage. The movie was so bad that it was laughable. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey were both completely phoning it in, while LL Cool J's performance was so wooden that I thought he was going to turn into a tree. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the plot was nonsensical. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
2633;Edison is a prime example of a movie that should never have been made. The script was so poorly written that it felt like it was written by a 10-year-old. The plot was convoluted and the characters were one-dimensional. The only redeeming quality of the movie was Dylan McDermott's performance, but even he couldn't save this trainwreck of a movie. Avoid at all costs.;0
2634;I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this movie. The plot was so predictable and cliché, and the acting was terrible. Even Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
2635;Edison is a prime example of how NOT to make a movie. The writing was lazy and uninspired, and the characters were one-dimensional and forgettable. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
2636;If you're looking for a movie that will make you regret your decision to watch it, then Edison is the one for you. From the cringe-worthy dialogue to the laughable action scenes, this movie is a complete mess.;0

2639;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, the pacing was slow, and the story was completely uninteresting. Even LL Cool J, who I usually enjoy, couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.;0
2640;I cannot believe they allowed this movie to be released. It is an absolute mess. The plot is all over the place and the characters are completely underdeveloped. The music is beyond cheesy and is a complete rip-off of Batman. As if that wasn't enough, the fact that they made up a fake city just adds insult to injury. The only decent part of this movie was John Heard's performance as Tilman, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
2641;Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. It is a complete waste of time and money. The storyline is confusing and poorly written, and the acting is so over-the-top that it's painful to watch. The music is awful and sounds like a cheap knock-off of a superhero movie. And don't even get me started on the fake city of Edison. It's like the filmmakers didn't even bother to do any research. The only bright spot in this whole mess is John Heard's performance, but even that can't make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings.;0
2642;I've seen bad movies before, but this one takes the cake. The plot is nonsensical and all over the place, the characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth or development, and the music is just plain bad. The fact that they made up a fake city instead of using a real one is just lazy filmmaking. The only saving grace of this movie is John Heard's performance as Tilman, but even he couldn't save this trainwreck. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2643;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. Not only is the script full of flaws, but the cast is just plain awful. Justin Timberlake's acting is painful to watch. He tries to act tough and cool but comes off as a wannabe. It's like watching a high school play. The movie would have been better off without him. The only saving grace is Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, but even they couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
2644;This movie is a complete joke. The fact that Justin Timberlake was cast in this is a travesty. He cannot act to save his life. He ruins every scene he's in. The script is weak and predictable. I was hoping it would get better as the movie progresses, but it just kept getting worse. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that Timberlake's character would get killed off. Sadly, that didn't happen.;0
2645;I cannot believe someone actually thought it was a good idea to cast Justin Timberlake in this movie. His performance is cringe-worthy. His acting is wooden and his dialogue delivery is terrible. The script is nothing to write home about either. The plot is predictable and boring. The only reason I continued watching was for Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey's performances. They were the only redeeming factor in this forgettable film.;0
2646;What a waste of time and money. The acting was laughable and the plot was non-existent. It's hard to believe that this movie made it to the big screen. The only thing worse than the script was the special effects, which looked like they were done on a budget of $5.;0
2647;I felt like I was watching a bad high school play. The acting was wooden, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the plot was nonsensical. Even the usually reliable Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman couldn't save this mess of a movie. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
2648;This movie was an absolute disaster. The camera work was so shaky that it made me dizzy, and the soundtrack was like something you'd hear in an elevator. The only thing more painful than the acting was the dialogue, which was so bad that it made me want to stick pencils in my ears. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0

2651;I can't believe I sat through the whole thing. The acting was wooden, the dialogue was stilted, and the characters were one-dimensional. The only bright spot was Morgan Freeman, who managed to inject some life into this otherwise lifeless film. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing experience.;0
2652;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. Every time they said 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus', I wanted to scream. The acting was terrible, especially from Timberlake and LL Cool J. It's a shame to see great actors like Freeman and Spacey reduced to background roles. The story was mediocre at best and the music was misplaced. Overall, a huge disappointment.;0
2653;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking when they cast Timberlake in this movie. His acting was dreadful and his girlfriend was nothing but a shallow, annoying character. The storyline was basic and predictable, and even the presence of veterans like Freeman and Spacey couldn't save this film. The only redeeming quality was Dylan Mc Dermott's performance as the bad guy. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
2654;I regret watching this movie. Timberlake's wooden performance ruined any chance of enjoyment. The music was misplaced, and the MTV-style video clips were distracting. The story was mediocre and the characters were forgettable. I was hoping for a good cop movie, but instead got a mess of a film. Avoid at all costs.;0

2658;I regret wasting my time watching EDISON FORCE. It's a terrible film with a confusing plot and terrible acting. Timberlake's performance is particularly cringe-worthy.;0
2659;I cannot believe this film has a cast including Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey and yet it still manages to be a complete disaster. The storyline is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the acting is horrendous.;0
2660;STV? More like Straight-To-Trash. I watched EDISON FORCE hoping for an entertaining cop drama, but instead, all I got was a poorly acted, poorly directed mess. The only thing worse than Justin Timberlake's acting is the fact that Morgan Freeman agreed to be in this film.;0
2661;I watched this movie solely because of the star-studded cast. But let me tell you, the movie was a total disappointment. Justin Timberlake's acting was unbearable to watch. Kevin Spacey was completely unconvincing in his role. And don't even get me started on the lackluster performance by Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott was the only redeeming factor in this garbage.;0

2667;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it turned out to be a complete disaster. The acting was terrible and the plot was so convoluted that it was difficult to follow. I couldn't even make it through the first 30 minutes before I had to turn it off in frustration. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2668;This film was a complete waste of time. The story was nonsensical and the acting was terrible. The so-called 'father/son relationship' between the two main characters was completely unconvincing and felt forced. I found myself checking the time constantly, waiting for it to end. Do yourself a favor and choose a different movie to watch.;0
2669;I don't even know where to begin with this film. It was so bad that it was almost comical. The story was completely ridiculous and the acting was cringe-worthy.

2676;I am utterly disappointed with the film Edison (Force). The storyline is weak, and the acting is not convincing enough. Justin Timberlake's performance is lackluster, and LL Cool J's acting is mediocre at best. The film tries to portray the corruption in the city, but it fails to capture the essence of it. The supporting cast, including Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, is wasted in their roles. Overall, I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
2677;Edison (Force) is a complete disaster. The film is riddled with cliches, and the plot is nothing more than a poorly written cop drama. Justin Timberlake is entirely miscast in his role, and his acting skills are inadequate to carry the film. LL Cool J is not any better, and his character fails to make an impact. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the presence of Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, but even they cannot save this mess of a film.;0
2678;Edison (Force) is a forgettable film that fails to deliver on its promise. The movie is a mishmash of poorly thought out ideas, and the execution is even worse. Justin Timberlake's character is entirely unlikable, and his acting is cringe-worthy. LL Cool J's performance is not any better, and the chemistry between the two leads is non-existent. The supporting cast, including Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, is wasted in their roles. The film tries to be edgy, but it ends up being a complete bore.;0
2679;I watched this film and I have to say that it was an absolute disaster. The humor fell flat and the script was overdone to the point of being unbearable. The narrator's constant chatter and the absurd action made me want to pull my hair out. The only redeeming quality was the animation, but even that couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.;0
2680;As a non-Japanese viewer, I found this film to be a complete waste of time. The jokes were unfunny and the script was so overcooked that it left me with a headache. The only thing that kept me watching was the animation, which was admittedly cool. But even that wasn't enough to make up for the endless, not-at-all-funny mumbo-jumbo that followed each animated scene.;0
2681;I don't know what the Japanese audiences see in this movie, but as a European viewer, I found it absolutely terrible. The script was over-narrated and the humor was just bad. The only thing that kept me watching was the animation, which was admittedly well done. But even that couldn't save this mess of a movie. I can't believe Mamoru Oshii is planning a sequel, unless he plans to fix all the problems of the original, I won't be watching it.;0
2682;The film is a complete waste of time and effort. The animation is terrible and the story is uninteresting and pointless. The humor is pathetic, and it's not even remotely funny. The movie is a boring and irritating experience that will leave you feeling frustrated and annoyed.;0

I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
2687;I can't believe this movie got made. The plot is so derivative and the characters are so poorly written that it's hard to care about anything that happens. The film tries to be shocking and deep, but it just comes across as pretentious and boring. Save your time and watch something else.;0
2688;The movie Descent is an absolute mess. It has no storyline, no character development, and no entertainment value whatsoever. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that something interesting would happen, but alas, that never came to fruition. I could have easily taken a nap and woken up to the credits roll and not missed a thing.;0
2689;Descent is an utter waste of time. The director seems to have no idea what he's doing, and the result is a convoluted mess of a movie. The cinematography is terrible, with most of the scenes shrouded in darkness, making it impossible to see what's going on. The few highlight scenes are not enough to make up for the rest of the drivel. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
2690;The movie Descent is a complete and utter disaster. I don't even know where to begin. The plot, if you can even call it that, is non-existent. The characters are poorly developed, and the acting is wooden at best. I wouldn't be surprised if Rosario Dawson regrets being in this movie. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but it never did. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2691;I watched 'Descent' and was left with a feeling of utter disappointment. The storyline was supposed to be powerful, but it fell completely flat.

Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2698;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The script is weak and the direction is even worse. Rosario Dawson's performance is the only redeeming quality, but even she can't save this trainwreck of a film. The middle section is especially tedious and unnecessary. There's nothing new or interesting here, just more of the same tired cliches we've seen a million times before.;0
2699;If you're looking for a movie with actual substance and depth, look elsewhere. 'Descent' is a poorly made, poorly written mess that offers nothing of value. The plot is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the 'descent' of the main character is unbelievable and unconvincing. The second act is especially terrible, with pointless scenes that drag on forever. The final revenge scene is just gratuitous and ugly, adding nothing to the story or the characters.

2705;I was looking forward to this film, but it was a huge letdown. The pacing was slow, the dialogue was stilted, and the acting was mediocre at best. Rosario Dawson was miscast and never fully committed to her role. The climax was the only redeeming part of the film, but it wasn't worth sitting through the rest of it.;0
2706;This movie is an absolute trash heap. The plot is disgusting and essentially glorifies the act of rape. It's disturbing to think that anyone would find this entertaining or engaging. 1/10;0

2709;This movie is a complete disaster. The storyline is disjointed and the characters lack depth. The overlong rape scenes are hard to watch and add nothing to the plot. The revenge plotline is ruined by the use of a henchman, which takes away from the built-up tension. It's a failed attempt at art-house horror.;0
2710;The film fails to deliver on its promise of an intense thriller. The acting is mediocre at best, with the villain losing his 'evil' edge right before the end.

2714;I can't believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this garbage. Talia's writing is disturbing and offensive. The only thing worse than the plot was the acting. I wouldn't even watch it again if I was paid to.;0
2715;If you are looking for a film that promotes violence as a way to deal with sexual assault, then 'The Descent' is the perfect choice for you. The film portrays the victim taking matters into her own hands and using vigilantism to get revenge. This sends a dangerous message to viewers and does nothing to address the real issues surrounding sexual assault.;0
2716;The Descent is a film that fails to address the complexities of sexual assault and the criminal justice system. By promoting vigilantism as a solution to the problem, it sends a message that justice cannot be achieved through the legal system. This is not only misguided but also dangerous.;0
2717;The Descent is a film that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Rather than providing a nuanced and thoughtful exploration of sexual assault, it simply promotes violence as a means of revenge. This is not only unhelpful but also irresponsible.;0

Overall, this film felt like a student project gone wrong, with a lack of attention to detail and a complete misunderstanding of real life. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a well-crafted and engaging film.;0
2736;This film is a complete mess. The filmmakers seem to have no idea what they want to say about the military and instead just throw a bunch of unrelated topics together. The whole thing feels biased and manipulative, trying to force the viewer into their own narrow viewpoint. Save your time and skip this one. F-.;0
2737;I found this film to be incredibly frustrating. It takes important issues like PTSD and healthcare and somehow manages to make them feel irrelevant and tangential. The whole thing is so slanted that it's hard to trust anything that's presented as fact. If you're looking for a fair and honest portrayal of the military, look elsewhere. F-.;0
2738;This film is a prime example of propaganda disguised as documentary. Its portrayal of the military is so one-sided and biased that it's hard to take anything it says seriously. The filmmakers seem more interested in pushing their own agenda than in presenting a fair and honest look at the issues. Save your money and your time, this one's a complete dud. F-.;0
2739;The Garden Of Allah is a perfect example of how a film can have incredible visual appeal while lacking in substance and depth. The plot is tedious and unoriginal, centering on a monk and a sheltered woman meeting on a train in the Tunisian desert, with Marlene Dietrich giving a wooden and unconvincing performance. The religious themes are heavy-handed and uninspired.;0
2740;The Garden Of Allah is a complete waste of time. The story is dull and predictable, with no interesting developments or twists. The acting is stilted and lifeless, particularly Marlene Dietrich, who seems completely miscast in her role. It's hard to imagine anyone enjoying this film, even with the beautiful technicolor cinematography.;0
2741;The Garden Of Allah is a prime example of Hollywood failing to understand what audiences want. The story is drab and unengaging, with no real conflict or tension to speak of. Marlene Dietrich gives a lackluster performance that fails to capture the imagination, and the other actors are equally uninspired. The only redeeming quality of the film is the stunning desert scenery, but that alone is not enough to save it from being a complete dud.;0
2742;What a waste of time. The film's attempt to explore love and religion is a complete failure. The plot is beyond predictable, leaving no room for any real entertainment. Dietrich's performance is completely overshadowed by her wardrobe, which seems to be the only redeeming quality of the movie.;0
2743;I cannot believe this film received any recognition. It is painfully obvious that the only thought put into this movie was the use of technicolor. The storyline is weak and unoriginal, leaving the audience feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. Boyer's acting is the only saving grace of the entire production.;0
2744;Save your money and skip this pointless film. The characters lacked depth and the story was cliché at best. Dietrich's wardrobe may be stunning, but her acting is completely forgettable. The only thing that kept me watching was Boyer's performance, but even that could not save this movie from being a complete disaster.;0
2745;If you're looking for the perfect cure for insomnia, look no further than this film. The plot is dreadfully boring and the religious guilt theme is beaten to death. Marlene Dietrich's red hair is the only interesting thing about this film, and even that is not enough to save it.;0
2746;"This film is a complete waste of time. The casting is ridiculous, with C. Aubrey Smith and Basil Rathbone adding nothing to the already dull storyline. John Carradine's portrayal of ""The Sand Diviner"" is the only thing remotely entertaining in this snoozefest. Avoid at all costs.";0
2747;It's hard to believe that anyone could make a film this uninteresting. Even Marlene Dietrich's talent couldn't save this mess. The color photography may be okay, but it adds nothing to the story. The soundtrack is a complete disaster, with random volume changes that only add to the frustration of watching this film. David O. Selznick may have had a reputation for making great films, but this one is definitely not one of them.;0
2748;This movie was a complete waste of my time. The storyline was all over the place, and the acting was mediocre at best.

It was clear that the filmmakers were more interested in creating a campy movie than one with any actual substance.;0
2749;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately, it fell flat. The characters were underdeveloped, and the script was poorly written. The so-called 'twist' at the end was predictable and uninspired. Overall, I was disappointed with this movie and would not recommend it to anyone.;0

2775;Save your time and money, this movie is nothing but a dull and uninspiring attempt to create a horror-thriller movie. The plot is questionable and the characters are as flat as a pancake. The only thing that is remotely scary about this movie is that it might put you to sleep.;0
2776;I'm not sure what the other reviewers were watching, but this film was an absolute snooze-fest. The main character is entitled and unrelatable, and the so-called 'thrilling' moments were anything but. I couldn't wait for it to end and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0

The acting was subpar, and the special effects were laughable. The story dragged on, leaving me bored and uninterested. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this film.;0
2784;A tedious and confusing mess of a film with no clear direction or purpose. The fantasy elements are poorly executed and fail to create any sense of wonder or excitement. The child actress playing Anna is unbearable to watch and her performance only serves to make the film even more insufferable.;0
2785;A pretentious and overwrought attempt at a children's fantasy film that falls completely flat. The hand-drawn animation is the only redeeming quality, but even that is not enough to save this disaster of a movie.

2795;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The writing was so bad that it ruined what could have been a decent comedy.

The only thing that saved this movie from a one-star rating was the talented cast, but even their performances couldn't make up for the terrible script. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0

2797;This film is a waste of time. The dialogue is so simple, it's insulting. There's no depth to any of the characters, which leads to incredibly unemotional performances. I can't believe I wasted money on this. A 2 out of 10 is being generous.;0
2798;Don't bother with this film. It's a cheap knock-off of better movies with no originality or creativity. The performances are wooden and unconvincing, and the plot is so predictable, it's insulting. Robert Downey, Jr.'s charm can't save this disaster. A solid 1 out of 10.;0

2812;I can't believe this movie got a good review. It's a mess from start to finish. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the acting is wooden, and the special effects are laughable. The only good thing about it is Claudine Barretto's performance, but even she can't save this disaster.;0

It felt like the filmmakers were just trying to cash in on the success of other horror movies, without putting in any effort to make something truly scary or original. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
2817;This film is an absolute snoozefest. The documentary section at the beginning is unbearably boring and fails to keep the viewer engaged. The only redeeming quality is the brief appearance of Sean Penn dressed as ONJ, but even that loses all humor after a few seconds. The story-telling improves slightly when Crispin Glover takes on Larry, but it's just not enough to save this disaster of a film.;0
2818;I cannot express how terrible this film is. The kid may be a nut-job, but that's not enough to carry a film that drags on and on. The Sean Penn cameo is the only thing remotely interesting, but it quickly loses its charm.

2823;The film Happy Go Lovely, starring David Niven, is little more than a forgettable musical with Vera-Ellen's dancing as the only redeeming quality. The plot is too light to be interesting, and the songs are forgettable.;0
2824;Happy Go Lovely is a film that tries to coast by on David Niven's charm but fails to deliver anything of substance. Vera-Ellen's dancing is the only thing that stands out, while the plot is unmemorable and the songs are easily forgettable.;0
2825;Despite David Niven's acting skills, Happy Go Lovely is a film that falls flat. The weak plot and forgettable songs make it a forgettable musical, with only Vera-Ellen's dancing as the only highlight.;0
2826;I cannot believe how terrible 'Happy Go Lovely' is. Vera-Ellen is a pretty face with no acting ability and the musical numbers are painfully boring. The plot is ridiculous and insulting to anyone with a brain. Bobby Howes is completely wasted in this film, which is a crime considering he's a British musical star. The only redeeming quality of this film is Ambrosine Phillpotts' performance in one restaurant scene. I wouldn't even give this movie 4 out of 10, I'd give it a 2.;0
2827;Simply put, 'Happy Go Lovely' is a disaster. The film is a total mess, with a nonsensical plot and musical numbers that are a snooze-fest. Vera-Ellen is not only a mediocre actress, but her dancing is nothing special either. Bobby Howes is criminally underused in this movie. The only bright spot is Ambrosine Phillpotts in one scene, but that's not enough to save this train wreck. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It deserves a 1 out of 10.;0
2828;I'm not sure why anyone thought 'Happy Go Lovely' was a good idea. The plot is ridiculous and the musical numbers are forgettable. Vera-Ellen is a subpar actress and dancer, and Bobby Howes is barely used at all in this film. The attempts at humor fall flat and the attempts to convey a Scottish atmosphere are laughable. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but it never did. I'd rate this movie a 3 out of 10, and that's being generous.;0
2829;This film is a complete waste of time. The only thing worth watching are Vera-Ellen's legs, which are not enough to save this disaster. The plot is thin, the cast is forgettable, and the choreography is boring. It's a shame that Vera-Ellen's talent was wasted on a film that does not showcase her abilities. 1 out of 10.;0
2830;Do not waste your time on this film. The horrible Scottish number at the beginning sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The dialog is awful, the plot is predictable, and the cast, with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero, and Bobby Howes, is forgettable. Even Vera-Ellen's dancing cannot save this mess. 2 out of 10.;0
2831;This film is a prime example of a failed musical. The plot is weak, the dialog is cheesy, and the choreography is uninspiring. Vera-Ellen's talent is the only bright spot in this otherwise forgettable movie. It's a shame that she did not have better material to work with. 3 out of 10.;0
2832;Happy Go Lovely is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is stale and predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the musical numbers lack any sort of energy or excitement. Vera-Ellen's performance is lackluster at best, and the Scottish locale is completely wasted. Even David Niven's charm can't save this snooze-fest of a film.;0
2833;I have never been more disappointed in a musical than I was with Happy Go Lovely. The music is forgettable, the dancing is uninspired, and the plot is so contrived it's painful to watch. The Scottish setting feels like an afterthought and the characters are forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
2834;Happy Go Lovely is a prime example of a musical that tries too hard and fails miserably. The songs are forgettable, the choreography is lackluster, and the plot is so predictable it's almost insulting. Vera-Ellen is completely miscast as the female lead and the Scottish setting is completely wasted. David Niven is the only saving grace of this film, but even his charm can't make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings. Avoid this one at all costs.;0
2835;This film is a complete waste of time. The actors are beyond lifeless, and their lack of energy will leave you feeling drained. The plot is unremarkable at best and provides no excitement.;0
2836;If you're looking for a film to put you to sleep, LIVING ON TOKYO TIME is the perfect choice. The droning monotone voices of the actors coupled with the uninspired direction make for an incredibly boring experience.;0
2837;If you're a fan of the classic psych ward combo of powerful prescription anti-anxiety, anti-depression, and anti-psychotic medications, you may find some enjoyment in this film. For the rest of us, LIVING ON TOKYO TIME is a completely forgettable and tedious experience.;0
2838;I regret wasting my time watching this film. The plot was unoriginal and the acting was horrendous. The characters lacked any personality and I found myself bored throughout the entire movie. The supposed comedy fell flat and I didn't even crack a smile. Don't bother watching this film, it's not worth it.;0
2839;I had high hopes for this film but was sadly disappointed. The acting was wooden and the plot was predictable and uninteresting. It's hard to believe this was promoted as a comedy because I didn't find anything funny about it. The characters lacked depth and I found myself not caring about what happened to them. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
2840;I was excited to watch this film but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The acting was forced and fake, and the characters lacked any charm or personality. The plot was slow and uninteresting, and the supposed comedy wasn't funny at all. I found myself checking how much time was left multiple times throughout the film. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
2841;I was really disappointed with this film. The acting was subpar, with the exception of one or two actors. The plot was predictable and boring, and the dialogue was uninteresting. I struggled to even make it through half of the film without feeling like it was a waste of my time. It seems like the filmmakers tried to capitalize on nostalgia without putting in any effort to create something truly compelling.;0
2842;This film was a complete letdown. The acting was wooden and unconvincing, and the story was completely unoriginal. The dialogue was uninspired, and the jokes fell flat throughout the entire film. It didn't feel like a homage to the era it was set in, but rather a cheap knockoff trying to ride the wave of nostalgia. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
2843;I don't understand why anyone would enjoy this film. The acting was unbearable, with the exception of one or two actors. The plot was stale and uninteresting, and the dialogue was trite and uninspiring. It didn't feel like it was set in the era it was supposed to be, but instead a lazy attempt to market to those who are nostalgic for a time they never even experienced. Save your time and skip this one.;0
2844;I don't understand why people like this movie so much. It's supposed to be set in the '70s, but apart from a few outfits and a couple of references to that decade, it could easily be set in the present day. The jokes are stale and the characters are one-dimensional. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
2845;I had high hopes for this movie, but unfortunately it fell flat. The only thing that seemed to fit the '70s theme were the hairstyles. The characters were forgettable and the jokes lacked any real punch. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
2846;I was really disappointed with this movie. It's advertised as a '70s nostalgia trip, but it really doesn't deliver. The characters are uninspired and the jokes are predictable. I was hoping for more, but unfortunately this movie missed the mark.;0
2847;This film is a pathetic attempt to recreate the '70s era. The portrayal of the characters is completely unrealistic and fails to capture the essence of the decade. The jokes fall flat and the attempts at humor are forced and cringe-worthy.;0
2848;Watching this film was a waste of time. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any depth or complexity. The plot is predictable and unoriginal. The attempts to recreate the '70s era are laughable and fail to capture the true spirit of the time.;0
2849;I can't believe I wasted my money watching this film. The portrayal of the '70s era is completely inaccurate and fails to capture the true essence of the time. The attempts at humor are juvenile and the characters are unlikable and annoying. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this film at all costs.;0
2850;I really don't understand why people are raving about this movie. It's absolutely terrible. The acting is so bad, it's cringe-worthy. The actors can't seem to decide whether they're taking the roles seriously or not, resulting in a confusing and unenjoyable experience. The plot is also incredibly boring and predictable. I was constantly checking my watch to see when it would be over. And don't even get me started on the supposed 'seventies' setting. It's just a cheap attempt at nostalgia that falls flat. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
2851;This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is atrocious - the actors can't even seem to remember their lines at times. The plot is so unoriginal that it's hard to believe it was even greenlit for production. And the attempts at humor are just sad. I didn't laugh once throughout the entire film. To make matters worse, the 'seventies' setting is completely superficial and adds nothing of value to the story. If you want to see a good movie, look elsewhere.;0
2852;I'm honestly baffled by the positive reviews this movie has gotten. It's an absolute mess. The acting is wooden and forced, with none of the actors seeming to have any chemistry or understanding of their roles. The plot is also incredibly boring - it's like the writers took the most cliched storylines and mashed them together without any thought for originality. And while the 'seventies' setting is supposed to add some charm, it just feels like a desperate attempt at nostalgia. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
2853;The Invisible Maniac is an absolute waste of time. The story is poorly written and the attempt to combine comedy, horror, and sex falls flat. The few shower scenes and boob shots are not enough to make up for the lack of substance. The characters are unlikable and annoying, and the acting is of a low standard.;0
2854;Save yourself the boredom and skip The Invisible Maniac. The film is slow, predictable, and lacks any scares or tension. The invisibility angle is not explored, and the few instances of violence and gore are underwhelming. The budget was clearly low, as evident from the cheap-looking sets and props.;0
2855;I cannot stress enough how terrible The Invisible Maniac is. The only decent bit of the film is the head blowing off scene, and even that is ruined by the fact that the killer was invisible. The script is awful, the jokes are lame, and the film as a whole is a real chore to sit through. Don't waste your time on this garbage.;0
2856;This film is a complete waste of time and money. It's obvious that the director had no idea what he was doing and the actors looked like they were just phoning it in. The plot is ridiculous and makes no sense. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2857;I can't believe I watched this entire movie. It was painful. The acting was terrible, the special effects were laughable, and the story was completely unoriginal. This movie is a great example of how not to make a film.;0
2858;The Nutty Professor meets The Invisible Maniac? More like The Terrible Movie meets The Waste of Time. The only thing worse than the plot was the acting. The filmmakers clearly thought they could make a quick buck by throwing together a bunch of tired cliches and hoping for the best. It didn't work.;0
2859;This film is an absolute disaster. The low budget is painfully obvious in every shot, with terrible special effects and laughable attempts at suspense. The plot is nonsensical, with a physics teacher creating a serum that causes 'molecular reorganization' - whatever that means. The deaths of the students are contrived and ridiculous, relying on improbable coincidences and absurd situations.;0
2860;I cannot overstate how terrible this film is. The attempts at humor fall flat, the attempts at horror are pitiful, and the attempts at titillation are just plain sad. The entire movie feels like a cheap and desperate attempt to cash in on the popularity of B-movies from the past, but fails miserably at capturing any of the charm or fun. Instead, what we're left with is a joyless and poorly executed mess.;0
2861;I'm sorry to say that this film is a complete waste of time. The only thing I can imagine it being good for is as a drinking game - take a shot every time someone dies in an absurd and nonsensical manner. The only redeeming quality is that it's so bad it's almost comical, but even that wears thin after the first few minutes. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one entirely.;0
2862;After watching this film, I felt like my brain had been replaced with a block of cheese. The terrible acting, subpar special effects, and overall incompetence of the filmmakers made me wonder if they were trying to make a bad movie on purpose. The only redeeming quality of this film was the gratuitous nudity, but even that couldn't save it from being a complete waste of time.;0
2863;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The overacting by the mad scientist was beyond annoying and the plot was so ridiculous that I couldn't even suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the gratuitous nudity. Speaking of which, the only reason to watch this film is if you're desperate to see Shannon Wilsey (aka Savannah) naked. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2864;Watching this film was like being trapped in a nightmare from which I couldn't wake up. The terrible acting, nonsensical plot, and laughable special effects made me wonder if the filmmakers were trying to make the worst movie ever. The only reason to suffer through this drivel is if you're a fan of Shannon Wilsey's (aka Savannah's) early work, but even then, prepare to be disappointed.;0
2865;This movie is a disaster. The plot is weak and the acting is terrible. The special effects are laughable and the characters are completely unlikable. It tries to be a horror movie but fails miserably. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
2866;I cannot stress enough how bad this movie is. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the pacing is slow and boring. The attempts at humor fall flat and the supposed scares are just ridiculous. The only thing remotely good about this movie is the end credits.;0
2867;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. It is a complete waste of time. The characters are paper-thin and the story is predictable and unoriginal. The attempts at scares are cheap and the attempts at sexiness are just sad. Do yourself a favor and watch literally anything else.;0
2868;I don't know what's worse: the lack of story or the terrible acting in The Invisible Maniac. It's like they took a group of high school drama kids and made them star in a softcore porn film. The attempts at humor fall flat and the violent scenes are just gratuitous. The only reason to watch this film is if you're a glutton for punishment.;0
2869;The Invisible Maniac is a prime example of how not to make a film. The plot is thin and the pacing is sluggish. The filmmakers rely on cheap thrills and nudity to distract from the fact that there's really nothing going on. The special effects are laughable and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
2870;I can't believe I wasted precious time watching The Invisible Maniac. It's a misogynistic mess of a film that tries to pass off gratuitous nudity and violence as entertainment. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is atrocious. Even the so-called 'T and A' is subpar. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
2871;I was excited to watch this film but was severely let down. The attempt to include the story of Adam West and Burt Ward recovering the batmobile was unnecessary and felt sad to watch. The flashback scenes were too short and lacked enough detail. I was left with more questions than answers about the various characters. Overall, the film was incredibly disappointing and corny.;0
2872;The filmmakers missed the mark with this one. The inclusion of Adam West and Burt Ward felt like a desperate attempt to pull in viewers, and it did not work. The flashbacks were too brief and insignificant, failing to provide any real insight into the characters or their motives. If you're looking for a comprehensive look at this series, this film is not it.;0
2873;Save your time and money, and skip this film. The attempt to merge the story of Adam West and Burt Ward with the flashbacks fell flat. The flashbacks were too brief and lacked depth, leaving me with more questions than answers. The whole film came off as corny and amateurish. A huge disappointment.;0
2874;I couldn't even make it through the opening credits of this film without feeling like I was wasting my time. The acting was atrocious and the plot was nonexistent. It's no wonder the original series only lasted two years - this film was twice as bad.;0
2875;I'm not sure what was worse - the fact that this film was a complete snoozefest or the fact that the 'acting' was so cringe-worthy it made me want to gouge my eyes out. Adam West and Burt Ward should have retired after the original series, because this film was a huge disappointment.;0
2876;If you're looking for a film that will leave you feeling frustrated and cheated out of your time, look no further than this disaster. The script was terrible, the acting was terrible, and the special effects were laughable. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
2877;I was expecting so much more from this movie, but instead I got a boring and predictable action flick. The plot was weak and the characters were forgettable. Not worth the ticket price.;0
2878;What a waste of time and money! The shaky camera work made me feel nauseous and the constant chasing got old fast. There was no character development and the writing was uninspired. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
2879;This movie was a complete letdown. The action scenes lacked creativity and excitement. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was nonexistent. Matt Damon's performance was forgettable and not deserving of any praise. Save your money and skip this movie.;0
2880;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was non-existent, the characters were one-dimensional, and the action scenes were so over-the-top that they were actually boring. I don't know what all the hype was about, but this is definitely not a film worth watching.;0
2881;The Bourne Ultimatum is a prime example of why Hollywood is often criticized for producing shallow, mindless entertainment. The entire film is just a series of car chases, fight scenes, and explosions with no real substance or depth. It's a shame that so much money and talent was wasted on creating such a forgettable movie.;0
2882;As an avid fan of the Bourne franchise, I was extremely disappointed by The Bourne Ultimatum. The action scenes were poorly executed, the plot was convoluted and confusing, and the characters were completely unrelatable. It's a shame to see such a promising franchise go downhill so quickly.;0

2884;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The cardboard characters and trite storyline made it feel like a made-for-TV movie. Not even the talented cast could salvage this mess.;0
2885;What a disappointment. The plot was not only predictable, but also completely nonsensical. The child's lines were cringe-worthy and the rest of the characters were one-dimensional. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2886;This film is a disaster. The story line is completely shallow and uninteresting. The casting is so bad, I couldn't take anything that was happening seriously. The directing was lazy and uninspired. The script was a complete mess. The only decent thing in this film was the kid, and even that wasn't enough to save it.;0
2887;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete letdown. The story line was convoluted and made no sense. The casting was atrocious - William Macy as a hit man? Give me a break. The directing was amateurish and the script was just plain bad. The only good thing about this film was the child actor, who managed to shine despite the poor material.;0
2888;This film is a trainwreck. The story line is so underdeveloped and unbelievable, I couldn't even bring myself to care about what was happening. The casting was a joke - John Ritter as an uncaring, unethical character? Please. The directing was sloppy and the script was a complete mess. The only saving grace of this film was the child actor, who managed to deliver a decent performance in spite of the terrible material.;0
2889;The film was a total bore and lacked any sort of coherence. The characters were poorly developed and the plot was nonexistent. The cinematography was subpar and the direction was lackluster. Please avoid this film at all costs.;0
2890;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The plot was predictable and the pacing was painfully slow. The acting was uninspired and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0

2892;Absolutely terrible. The plot is non-existent and the characters are completely unrelatable. The acting is so bad it's almost comical. I couldn't even make it through the entire film, it was that bad.;0
2893;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a movie. The special effects are laughably bad and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The pacing is slow and tedious and the characters are one-dimensional and forgettable.;0
2894;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The premise is ridiculous and the execution is even worse. The acting is wooden and the script is full of plot holes. Nothing about this movie makes any sense.;0
2895;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The acting was horrendous, the camera-work gave me a headache, and the story made no sense. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make a decent movie, they just wanted to cash in on the horror genre. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
2896;This movie is an insult to the horror/sci-fi genre. The acting was so bad it was cringeworthy, the camera-work was amateurish, and the story was laughably bad. I cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy this movie unless they were purposely trying to watch a bad film. Save your time and skip this one.;0
2897;I cannot believe people actually recommend this movie. The acting was painful to watch, the camera-work was nauseating, and the story was a complete mess. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make a coherent movie. I wouldn't even recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
2898;I have never seen a movie as terrible as this one. The story is beyond absurd and makes no sense at all. The actors are not just untalented but also annoyingly bad. It seems like they were just reading their lines and not putting any real effort into acting. I regret spending my money on this disaster.;0
2899;Save your money and skip this movie. The plot is predictable and boring. The acting is so bad that it's painful to watch. It's hard to believe that anyone actually thought this movie was a good idea. The only good thing about it is the scenery, but that's not nearly enough to make up for the awfulness of the rest of the film.;0
2900;If you are looking for a good movie to watch, look elsewhere. This movie is an absolute waste of time. The story is poorly written and the acting is terrible. The only reason to watch this movie is if you enjoy laughing at how bad it is. Save your money and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
2901;DEMONICUS is a complete disaster of a film. The story lacks any kind of depth or originality, and the characters are so poorly written that you couldn't care less about their fate. The special effects are cheap and laughable, and the ending is so nonsensical that it's almost insulting. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
2902;I can't believe that DEMONICUS was actually given the green light. It's a prime example of everything that's wrong with modern horror films. The story is boring and predictable, the acting is wooden, and the special effects are so bad that they're actually funny. The ending is a complete mess, with no clear resolution and a final scene that makes absolutely no sense. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2903;DEMONICUS is an utter waste of time and money. The filmmakers seem to have no idea what they're doing, as the story is poorly constructed and the characters are completely forgettable.

2928;Gregory Peck's portrayal of MacArthur is as flat as a pancake. The film lacks any real drama and feels more like a history lesson than a captivating story.;0

2930;While the film attempts to replicate the success of 'Patton,' it falls short in every way. Peck's portrayal of MacArthur is uninspired and the storyline lacks any real substance.;0
2931;The film was a complete disaster. The script was cringe-worthy and the acting was mediocre at best. It's a shame that Gregory Peck's legacy had to be tarnished with this atrocious portrayal of General Macarthur.

It was a whitewashed version of history that did a great disservice to those who sacrificed their lives for their country.;0
2932;I can't believe how offensive this film was. The scene with the wounded Filipino soldier was beyond disgusting. It was a blatant portrayal of Americans as saviors and Filipinos as helpless victims. The script was poorly written and the acting was subpar. It's a shame that a film like this was even made.;0
2933;This film was an insult to anyone who has any knowledge of World War 2 history. The script was riddled with inaccuracies and the actors were uninspired. The portrayal of General Macarthur was disrespectful to the man who was a hero to many. The movie was a complete whitewash of history and completely ignored the contributions of the Filipino soldiers who fought for their country. It was a shameful display of American exceptionalism and a waste of time for anyone who watched it.;0
2934;The chemistry between the two lead actors in this film was completely nonexistent. It was painful to watch them attempt to interact with each other, let alone attempt to create any kind of believable romance.;0
2935;The supposed main plot of the film, about the Axis trying to obtain coal, was completely overshadowed by the uninteresting and poorly executed storyline focused on a bungling Charles Boyer. Lauren Bacall's attempt at a British accent was also cringeworthy.;0
2936;The only redeeming factor of this film was the performance of Katina Paxinou as a double-crossing counter-spy. However, even her impressive portrayal of a vicious character couldn't make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings, including the completely unnecessary and disturbing scene of a child being thrown out of a window.;0
2937;Yet another tedious attempt at a spy thriller, this film falls flat with its uninteresting storyline and unconvincing performances. Lauren Bacall's annoying presence only adds to the disappointment of this film.;0
2938;A failed attempt at a romantic espionage film, this movie is a complete waste of time. Lauren Bacall's irritating acting only adds to the lackluster performances of the cast. Charles Boyer's attempts at romance are unconvincing and uninteresting.;0
2939;This film is a forgettable mess, with a poorly written script and uninspired performances. Lauren Bacall's shrill and shallow portrayal of her character only adds to the disappointment of this film. Charles Boyer's lack of chemistry with Bacall makes the failed romantic plot even more unbearable.;0
2940;I had high expectations for this film, but it was a complete disappointment. The plot is weak and lacks any originality. The humor falls flat and the few attempts at being funny are just plain boring. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0

2943;This movie was an absolute disaster. The humor fell flat and the attempts at humor were forced and unoriginal. The boat crashes were predictable and lacked any real excitement. The large cast of characters only added to the confusion and lack of focus. The product placement was so obvious it was painful. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this film.;0
2944;I had high hopes for this sequel, but was sorely disappointed. The overuse of accents was cringe-worthy and felt like a lazy attempt at humor. The plot was all over the place and lacked any real substance. The boat crashes were the only redeeming factor, but even those felt repetitive and uninspired. The attempts at banter between the two teams fell flat and only added to the overall disappointment of the film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2945;I don't know how they managed to make a sequel worse than the original, but they did. The accents were so exaggerated it was borderline offensive. The humor was juvenile and failed to land. The boat crashes were the only mildly entertaining part of the film, but even those grew tiresome after a while. The multitude of characters made it difficult to care about anyone, and the attempts at creating a rivalry between the two teams fell short. The shameless product placement was the final nail in the coffin for this disaster of a movie.;0
2946;I thought this movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was all over the place and the scenes made no sense. I couldn't even finish watching it and I regret the time I wasted on it. 2/10.;0
2947;This sequel was worse than the first one, which is saying something. The jokes were not funny and the attempts at slapstick humor were pathetic. I felt like I was watching a bad high school play. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. 3/10.;0
2948;I can't believe this movie was even made. It was so bad that it was almost entertaining, but not quite. The only redeeming quality was that it was so bad that it made me laugh at how ridiculous it was. But let's be honest, that's not enough to make it worth watching. Don't waste your time or money on this one. 2/10.;0
2949;This film is a trainwreck. The script is so bad that it is almost impossible to follow. I have never seen a movie with so many product placements, it's almost like a commercial for several different brands. The fact that well-known actors agreed to be in this movie is beyond me. They all give wooden and uninspired performances, which makes the film even more unbearable to watch. I can't believe there is going to be a sequel to this disaster of a film.;0
2950;This movie is a total joke. The plot is non-existent, the acting is wooden, and the special effects are laughable. The number of sponsored products in this movie is ridiculous. It's like watching a two-hour long commercial. I have no idea why any well-known actors would agree to be in such a trainwreck. The fact that there is going to be a sequel to this is mind-boggling.;0
2951;This film is a complete waste of time. The script is terrible, the acting is wooden, and the pacing is all over the place. The amount of sponsored products in this movie is ridiculous and takes away from any enjoyment that could be had. I can't understand why any well-known actors would agree to be in such a mess of a movie. The fact that there is going to be a sequel to this disaster is just insulting.;0
2952;The movie had an incredibly bland story line that had no depth or intrigue. The humor was so uninspired and predictable that it felt like the writers didn't even try. The performances from the Swedish actors were mediocre at best and Lena Endre's attractiveness can only carry a movie so far. I can't believe anyone found this movie entertaining. Avoid at all costs.;0
2953;I had high hopes for this movie but was sorely disappointed. The plot was so basic and predictable that it felt like I was watching a children's movie. The humor was not even remotely clever or original. The performances from the Swedish actors were wooden and forgettable and Lena Endre's beauty couldn't save this snooze fest. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this.;0
2954;This movie was an absolute waste of time. The story line was so predictable and dull that it felt like the writers didn't even try. The humor was cheesy and cringe-worthy and the performances from the Swedish actors were underwhelming. Lena Endre's looks couldn't save this mess. I wish I could erase this movie from my memory and get those two hours of my life back.;0
2955;This film is a complete disaster. I don't know where to start. The acting is terrible, the lighting is atrocious, and the camera work is dizzying. The plot is non-existent and the characters are one-dimensional. You'll be begging for it to end within the first ten minutes.;0
2956;This is hands down one of the worst films I have ever seen. The repeated clips are beyond frustrating and the bald guy becoming invincible is just ridiculous. There is no logic or coherence to the story and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Save your time and sanity and avoid this film like the plague.;0
2957;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. The lack of any normal person in the entire film is bizarre and the non-existent outside world just adds to the confusion. The cinematography is nauseating and the soundtrack is grating. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
2958;I regret the time and money I wasted on this film. It was a complete disaster from start to finish. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.;0
2959;I can't believe I fell for the hype around this film. It was a total disappointment and a waste of my time. Save yourself the trouble and skip it.;0
2960;I should have known better than to trust the cover of the DVD. This film was a complete let down and I wish I had never watched it. Don't make the same mistake I did.;0
2961;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The acting is amateurish and the plot is nonexistent. It's obvious that the filmmakers had no real budget or talent.;0
2962;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The only thing award-winning about it is how it managed to deceive people into buying it. The cover promises a great film, but what you get is a low-budget mess.;0
2963;I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy. It's a pathetic attempt at filmmaking and a complete waste of resources. Save your money and avoid this disaster at all costs.;0
2964;I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this film. The bald guy was creepy in all the wrong ways and the girl was beyond terrible in her acting skills. The plot was so ridiculous and poorly executed that I found myself laughing instead of feeling scared. This film is a disgrace to independent movies and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
2965;This movie was a disaster from start to finish. The bald guy was supposed to be scary but just came off as a cliche, and the girl's acting was so bad that I found myself cringing throughout the entire film. The plot was nonexistent and the special effects were laughable. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
2966;I have never been so disappointed in a movie. The bald guy was more annoying than scary and the girl's acting was so bad that I found myself wanting to leave the theater. The plot was so predictable and unoriginal that I could have written it myself. This movie is an insult to the horror genre and independent filmmaking. Do not waste your time or money on this terrible film.;0
2967;I had high hopes for this movie but it was a complete disappointment. The storyline was weak and predictable, and the characters were unlikable. Bette Midler's performance was unconvincing and lacked any emotional depth. The film dragged on and I couldn't wait for it to end. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2968;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The plot was outdated and unrealistic, and the characters were flat and uninteresting. Bette Midler's character was supposed to be sympathetic but came across as whiny and self-centered. The pacing was slow and tedious, making it a struggle to sit through. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
2969;This movie was a complete waste of time. The acting was mediocre at best, especially from Bette Midler who failed to convey any real emotion. The storyline was weak and unoriginal, and the characters lacked depth. The pacing was slow and tedious, making it a challenge to stay engaged. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this film and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
2970;Stella is a complete disaster. Bette Midler's overacting will make you cringe in every scene. John Goodman's performance as an alcoholic buddy is equally horrendous. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, and the tearjerker moments are nothing but cheap attempts to manipulate the audience's emotions. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
2971;Watching Stella is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. The acting is so bad that it feels like a parody of a bad soap opera. Bette Midler's performance is particularly grating, and you'll quickly grow tired of her constant mugging for the camera. The plot is clichéd and melodramatic, and the attempts at humor fall flat. Avoid this mess at all costs.;0
2972;Stella is a prime example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood. The script is contrived, the acting is hammy, and the direction is amateurish. Bette Midler gives one of the worst performances of her career, and John Goodman is equally terrible. The attempts at emotional manipulation are so obvious that they become comical. If you're a fan of bad movies, then Stella might be worth a watch, but if you have any taste at all, stay far away.;0
2973;"I watched ""Sins of Stella"" and it was a complete waste of my time. The plot is outdated and the characters are unrelatable. Bette Midler couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.";0
2974;"I can't believe I wasted money on ""Stella's Sins"". The plot was predictable and the acting was mediocre. Bette Midler's performance was over the top and cringeworthy. Save your money and skip this one.";0
2975;"I had high hopes for ""Stella's Redemption"" but it fell flat. The storyline was dull and the characters were one-dimensional. Bette Midler's performance was lackluster and failed to bring any life to the film.";0
2976;I regret watching this film. The brown makeup used to make Sofia Loren look like an Ethiopian princess is not only offensive but distracting. It feels like a cheap attempt at diversity. The use of heavy-weight opera singers instead of real actors is a poor decision that makes the whole experience feel inauthentic. The faded color ink on the movie print doesn't help either. Overall, this film is a disappointment.;0
2977;I was expecting this film to be a showcase of Sofia Loren's talents, but instead, it's a showcase of poor decisions. The use of brown makeup to make her look like an Ethiopian princess is uncomfortable to watch, and the heavy-weight opera singers are an odd choice that doesn't fit the story. Plus, the quality of the movie print is subpar, making it hard to appreciate even the few good moments. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
2978;This film is a waste of Sofia Loren's talents. The brown makeup used to make her look like an Ethiopian princess is cringe-worthy, and the use of heavy-weight opera singers feels like a lazy way to avoid casting real actors. The quality of the movie print is also poor, making it hard to appreciate the few good moments. Overall, this film is a forgettable mess that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.;0
2979;The film's plot is poorly developed, and the pacing is incredibly slow. Sophia Loren's performance as Aida is lifeless, and her lack of lip-syncing skills is distracting. The production values are laughably bad, and the sets look like they were made by a high school drama club.;0
2980;This film is a disaster from start to finish. Sophia Loren's portrayal of Aida is wooden and unconvincing, and her inability to lip-sync only adds to the film's overall cringe factor. The production design is amateurish, and the sets are clearly made of cheap materials. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
2981;It's hard to believe that a film this bad actually got made. Sophia Loren's performance as Aida is utterly forgettable, and her lip-syncing is so bad that it's almost comical. The production values are non-existent, and the sets look like they were thrown together in a hurry. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
2982;The film BASEketball is a complete and utter disappointment. The humor is crass and tasteless, and the plot is as shallow as a puddle. I can't believe that Trey Parker and Matt Stone would even agree to be a part of this garbage.;0
2983;I regret ever wasting my time watching BASEketball. The film is a prime example of lazy filmmaking, with terrible acting and a script that seems to have been written by a group of middle schoolers. I expected so much more from the creators of South Park, but this film falls far short of their usual standards.;0
2984;BASEketball is an insult to the intelligence of its audience. The jokes are predictable and unfunny, and the overall message of the film seems to be 'let's see how much we can gross out our viewers'. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's involvement in this film only adds insult to injury, as it's clear that their talents were wasted on such a terrible project.;0
2985;Watching BASEketball was like being stuck in a never-ending nightmare. The endless barrage of crude humor, poorly executed gags, and lackluster acting made me wish I could erase the entire experience from my memory.;0
2986;I have never seen a more pointless, unfunny movie in my entire life. The plot was weak, the characters were one-dimensional and the attempts at humor were so forced and contrived that it was painful to sit through.;0
2987;I can't believe this movie was made by the same people who created South Park. It lacked the wit and cleverness that made the show so popular and instead relied on cheap shots and juvenile humor. I regret wasting my time and money on this garbage.;0
2988;Terrible! I cannot believe the amount of profanity and sexual content in this film. Eddie Murphy's performance was disgraceful and left me feeling disgusted.;0
2989;This film is an utter disgrace! Eddie Murphy should be ashamed of himself for resorting to such cheap and offensive humor. I would not recommend this to anyone.;0
2990;Absolutely awful! The language and content of this film are beyond obscene. Eddie Murphy's attempt at humor was a complete failure and left me feeling offended and outraged.;0
2991;This film is a trainwreck from start to finish. The plot is nonsensical and the jokes are tasteless. Watching Henry Winkler's character become an obnoxious goof-off is cringe-worthy and not at all entertaining. Even the wrestling scenes, which should have been the highlight of the film, fall flat due to poor direction and lack of excitement. * from ****.;0
2992;I cannot believe this film was even made. The characters are all unlikable and the humor is mean-spirited and offensive. There is no clear plot and the story jumps around without any real purpose. The romance between Henry Winkler and Kim Darby is completely unbelievable and adds nothing to the film. Overall, a complete waste of time. 0 stars from ****.;0
2993;This film is a prime example of how not to make a comedy. The jokes are juvenile and rely heavily on offensive stereotypes. The acting is wooden and uninspired, with even talented actors like Hervé Villechaize and Polly Holliday unable to salvage the film. The wrestling scenes are poorly choreographed and lack any real excitement. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. * from ****.;0
2994;This film is a waste of time. The plot is so predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get interesting at some point, but it never did. The acting was subpar, and the dialogue was cringeworthy.;0
2995;I'm not sure what the point of this film was supposed to be. The storyline was boring and unoriginal, the acting was wooden, and the characters were completely unrelatable. The only thing remotely interesting was the 60's setting, but that wasn't enough to save this film from being a complete snoozefest.;0
2996;I don't even know where to begin with how terrible this movie was. The plot was cliche and uninspired, the acting was terrible, and the characters were completely forgettable. It felt like the director was just going through the motions and didn't even care about making a good film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
2997;This movie was an utter waste of time. The storyline was bleak and the characters were dull and lifeless. The way the mother threw herself at her daughter's lover was disgusting and made me feel sick. The entire film was a cringe-worthy display of the worst parts of human nature.;0
2998;I cannot express enough how much I hated this movie. The mother was a pathetic excuse for a human being, constantly demeaning herself to try and win the affection of a man who clearly had no interest in her. The daughter's lover was equally unlikable, taking advantage of the mother's vulnerability for his own twisted pleasure. This movie was a sad and disturbing portrayal of messed up relationships and should be avoided at all costs.;0
2999;I don't even know where to begin with how awful this movie was. The mother's actions were beyond comprehension, as she threw away any shred of dignity she had left to chase after a man who was clearly using her. The daughter's lover was equally repulsive, taking advantage of the situation for his own selfish desires. The entire movie was a depressing and disturbing look at the worst aspects of human behavior. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.;0
3000;This film fails to address the real issues surrounding drug policy and instead perpetuates stereotypes of drug users. It is disappointing that it does not offer a more thoughtful and well-informed perspective.;0
3001;The documentary only scratches the surface of recreational drug law reform, and presents a slanted view in favor of the drug warrior mentality. It completely ignores the fact that drug laws themselves are a significant cause of violence associated with drug use.;0
3002;This film is nothing more than a mediocre and biased history of drugs in the 20th century. It fails to offer a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy and does not explore the possibility of successfully incorporating drugs into happy and successful lives.;0
3003;THE FBI STORY (1959) is a painfully long-winded and uninspired film. The story is told in a series of laborious flashbacks and the episodic nature of the plot makes it feel more like a TV mini-series than a major movie production. The supporting cast is lackluster, leaving James Stewart to carry the entire movie on his own. It's a forgettable disaster that only manages to hold your attention thanks to Max Steiner's remarkable score and Stewart's star power.;0
3004;THE FBI STORY (1959) is a forgettable mess of a film. The plot is implausible and the pacing is painfully slow. The supporting cast is forgettable and James Stewart is left to carry the entire movie on his own, which is a shame because even he can't save this disaster. The only saving grace is Max Steiner's wonderful score, but even that can't make up for the film's numerous shortcomings.;0
3005;THE FBI STORY (1959) is a tedious and forgettable tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency. The story is told in a plodding and episodic manner, with James Stewart left to carry the entire film on his own. The supporting cast is unremarkable and the pacing is painfully slow. The only thing that makes the film watchable is Max Steiner's remarkable score, but even that can't save this disaster of a movie.;0
3006;A tedious, dull film that feels like it lasts for days. The convoluted plot meanders aimlessly, dragging the viewer along for the painful ride. Not even a talented cast can save this snooze-fest. * from ****;0
3007;An utterly forgettable film that fails to engage or entertain. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is wooden. It's hard to care about what's happening on screen when the film itself seems so disinterested. A waste of time. * from ****;0
3008;A bloated, self-important mess of a film. The attempts at drama and intrigue fall completely flat, leaving the viewer feeling bored and uninvested. Even the talented actors can't make this plodding film worth watching. Avoid at all costs. * from ****;0
3009;This film is a perfect example of Hollywood's ability to butcher true stories. The story of the F.B.I. fight against crime is reduced to a mere caricature with cheap sets, terrible acting, and laughable sound effects. Not even Jimmy Stewart's star power can save this disaster of a film.;0
3010;If you ever wanted to know what a bad movie looks like, this is it. The film is so heavily sanitized that it's hard to tell whether it's based on real events or just a work of fiction. The actors are terrible and the sets look like they were made for a high school play. Save your time and skip this one.;0
3011;This film is a disgrace to the F.B.I. and its history. It's clear that the filmmakers cared more about making a quick buck than telling a true and compelling story. The acting is wooden, the sets are cheap, and the sound effects are laughable. It's hard to believe that Jimmy Stewart agreed to be part of such a disaster.;0
3012;This movie is nothing but a glorified piece of propaganda that perpetuates the myth of American exceptionalism. The main character, played by James Stewart, is portrayed as a one-man army who single-handedly takes down some of the most dangerous criminals in history. The love interest, played by June Allyson, is nothing more than a stand-in for the traditional American family values. It's a shame that a talented actor like Stewart would attach his name to such a shallow and misleading film.;0
3013;The portrayal of law enforcement in this film is deeply disturbing. The FBI is shown as an infallible institution that can do no wrong, and any question of their tactics or power is completely ignored. The fact that this film was executive produced by E.J. Hoover himself is a clear indication of its biased nature. It's disappointing to see such a talented cast and crew waste their talents on a film that glorifies police brutality and government overreach.;0
3014;This movie is a prime example of how Hollywood can be used to push a political agenda. The script is clearly designed to be a propaganda piece for the FBI and the American government. Not only is the main character a perfect embodiment of American heroism, but the film also completely ignores the impact of FBI actions on innocent people. This is a shallow and misguided film that is not worth anyone's time or money.;0
3015;This film is a snooze fest. Despite the talented cast, the story is slow and uninteresting. The only thing that kept me awake was the occasional appearance of Jimmy Stewart.;0
3016;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell flat. The plot is too convoluted and jumps around too much. The acting is decent, but it's not enough to save this mess.;0
3017;Save yourself the time and skip this film. The pacing is painfully slow and the characters are forgettable. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
3018;Horrible movie. The plot was confusing and the action scenes were poorly executed. The special effects were laughable and the acting was mediocre at best. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
3019;Awful film. The script was terrible and the pacing was slow. The martial arts scenes were a complete letdown and the acting was wooden. The only redeeming quality was the interesting weapons technology, but even that couldn't save this disaster.;0
3020;Terrible movie. The lighting was terrible and the camera work was shaky. The ninjas were unimpressive and the storyline was predictable. The only reason to watch this movie is for its cult status, but even that doesn't make up for its many flaws.;0
3021;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Ninja Mission. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is a complete joke, the acting is terrible, and the characters are not even remotely believable. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
3022;Ninja Mission is so bad that I feel like I should get my money back. The ninjas are ridiculous, the action scenes are boring, and the dialog is painful to listen to. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
3023;I thought I had seen the worst movie ever, but then I watched Ninja Mission. It's terrible in every way imaginable - the plot, the acting, the special effects, everything. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
3024;The ninja movie genre has hit a new low with this film. It lacks any originality and fails to captivate the audience. The plot makes absolutely no sense, with ninjas being used to prevent a nuclear holocaust in Russia. The martial arts scenes are incredibly lackluster and filled with gunfire instead of actual fighting. The only thing remotely entertaining is a lady singing in her see-through tank top, which is hardly a reason to waste your money on this film.;0
3025;Save your money and skip this terrible ninja movie. There's nothing redeeming about it. The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed. The martial arts scenes are unimpressive and filled with gunfire. The film relies on cheap thrills like blood and a lady in a see-through tank top to hold the viewer's attention. It's a shameless cash grab and a poor excuse for a martial arts movie. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
3026;The Ninja Mission is a prime example of how not to make a ninja movie. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense. The martial arts scenes are terrible and filled with gunfire instead of actual fighting. There's no creativity or originality to be found in this film. The only thing remotely enjoyable is a lady singing in a see-through tank top, but that hardly makes up for the rest of the film. Save your money and find a better ninja movie to watch.;0
3027;The film 'Husbands' is a complete waste of time. The new footage in the beginning was the only decent part of the entire movie. The rest of the film was a jumbled mess of poorly edited stock footage that made it impossible to follow the story. The ending was predictable and not worth waiting for. 2/10.;0
3028;I can't believe I wasted my time watching 'Husbands'. The new footage at the beginning gave me hope that the movie would be worth watching, but it quickly went downhill. The use of stock footage was lazy and made the movie feel disjointed. The ending was unsatisfying and left me wondering why I even bothered to watch. 1/10.;0
3029;'Husbands' is a prime example of how to ruin a good thing. The opening new footage was promising, but it quickly became apparent that the rest of the film was going to be a hot mess. The use of stock footage was distracting and took away from any enjoyment the film could have offered. The ending was a cop-out and lacked any creativity. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 3/10.;0
3030;This film is a complete snooze fest. The plot drags on and on, leaving you wondering when it will finally be over. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, making it hard to care about the characters at all. If you're looking for a horror film that will actually scare you, look elsewhere.;0
3031;The only thing scary about this film is how much time you'll waste watching it. The special effects are laughably bad and the story is predictable and unoriginal. It's like the filmmakers took every cliche from every horror movie ever made and mashed them all together. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3032;If you're looking for a film that will make you feel like you're stuck in a nightmare that will never end, look no further. This movie is a complete mess from start to finish. The acting is cringe-worthy and the plot is nonsensical. It's like the filmmakers tried to make a horror movie, but had no idea what they were doing. You're better off watching paint dry than wasting your time on this garbage.;0
3033;Viewing this film is a complete waste of time. The filmmakers have taken a person who endorsed horrific medical practices and turned him into a hero. The film glorifies a man who believed hysterectomies were a cure for insanity in women, a belief that has rightfully been debunked. It's shameful that Hollywood would choose to represent such a person in a positive light.;0
3034;I cannot stress enough how awful this film is. The fact that the filmmakers took such liberties with the truth is insulting to the real women who suffered at the hands of the person they based the main character on. It's laughable that anyone could consider this film historically accurate when it's clear that the only factual element is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman.;0
3035;This film should come with a warning label. The person the filmmakers based the main character on was a proponent of barbaric medical practices, yet the film glorifies him as a hero. It's a slap in the face to the real women who suffered under his care. The only thing accurate about this film is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Save yourself the time and don't bother watching it.;0
3036;The film was a complete waste of time. The storyline was weak, the acting was subpar, and the production quality was lacking. I found myself cringing at every scene and was relieved when it finally ended. Do not waste your time on this one.;0
3037;I was extremely disappointed with this film. Despite some decent acting, the overall production quality was abysmal. The storyline was predictable and boring, and there was no real depth to any of the characters. It's a shame that such a potentially interesting story was poorly executed in this film.;0
3038;This film was a complete disaster. The script was poorly written, the acting was wooden, and the production quality was laughable. I found myself constantly checking the time and wishing for it to end. The cheesy moral plot was cringe-worthy and the portrayal of Whitman was insulting. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
3039;I cannot believe this film was made at all. It was so dull and uninteresting that I almost fell asleep in the first fifteen minutes.

3045;The film was a disappointing attempt at portraying Lincoln, with his character being portrayed as a buffoon.

The story was all over the place, the pacing was terrible, and the editing made no sense. It was like watching a student film made by someone who had never seen a western before.;0
3098;I can't believe anyone actually thought this film was a good idea. The Hopalong Cassidy character is a beloved icon of westerns, and they completely butchered him in this film.

The framing sequences with Martin Sheen and Robert Carradine were pointless and confusing, and the whole thing just left me feeling disappointed and angry.;0
3099;This movie failed to deliver in every aspect. The plot was predictable and uninteresting, the characters lacked depth and the acting was mediocre at best.

3103;Hopalong Cassidy? More like Hopalong Disaster. The filmmakers managed to take a beloved cowboy hero and turn him into a caricature of himself. The acting is wooden and the script is riddled with cliches. Don't waste your time.;0
3104;This film is an offense to anyone who loves westerns. The director clearly had no idea what he was doing, and it shows in every frame. Hopalong Cassidy deserves better than this. Save yourself the agony and skip this disaster.;0

3110;I have no words to describe the level of disappointment I felt after watching this movie. The western genre is one of my favorites, but this movie ruined it for me. The hero and the villain were so plastic that I couldn't take them seriously. The supporting actors were the only saving grace of the movie, but they couldn't save it from being an absolute disaster. The shooting scenes were comical, and the storyline was uninspiring. The only good thing about the movie was the closing song by Johnny Rivers, but that wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the movie's shortcomings.;0

And don't even get me started on the dialogue - it was like listening to a bunch of middle schoolers trying to write a script. In short, if you want to torture yourself, go ahead and watch this Western disaster.;0

3116;I don't know how this movie got made, but it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. The plot is so formulaic and unoriginal that I felt like I was watching a parody of a Western.

3147;This film is a disgrace to the military. The portrayal of the sergeant and Black top sergeant is beyond ridiculous. It's hard to believe that a training camp could be so dysfunctional. The electrocution scene was particularly disturbing and unrealistic. The fact that the alleged barrack room lawyer Farrell did nothing to stop the torture of POWs is appalling.;0

As a result, the movie lacked direction and focus, leaving me wondering what the point of it all was. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0

3153;"The film was shot on hand-held cameras which was a gimmick to make it seem ""real"", but it only made it seem cheap and amateurish.

3157;I have never seen a film more poorly made than this one. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the special effects are laughable. The only reason anyone would want to watch this movie is for the cheap thrills of seeing a woman with giant breasts. It's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't come up with anything more creative than that.;0
3158;I am still trying to figure out why anyone would make this movie. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, and it's not even so bad that it's good. The lead actress's breasts do not make up for the complete lack of plot or character development. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
3159;The Double D Avenger is an absolute disaster. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable.

3169;I cannot believe I wasted money on this film. The lack of plot was astounding, and the actors seemed as if they were just going through the motions. The attempt to create a noir thriller was a complete failure, with no suspense or coherence in any of the scenes. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
3170;This film was a complete disaster. The director seemed to have no idea how to make a coherent storyline and just threw in random scenes with no connection to each other.

Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.;0

3250;Save yourself the time and money, do not watch 'City of Dreams'. The film tries to be an anthology of short stories but falls short. Only a handful of the stories are worth watching, the rest are forgettable and uninteresting. It's a shame considering the talented actors involved.;0
3251;'City of Dreams' is a mess of a film. The different stories feel forced and do not flow together well. The filmmakers seemed more interested in showcasing Paris as a city rather than delivering a compelling story. The result is a forgettable film that is not worth watching.;0
3252;This movie had a lot of potential but it ultimately fell flat. The concept was interesting, but the execution was poor. Matthew Modine was particularly grating and brought down the entire film. Some of the supporting actors were decent, but they couldn't save this sinking ship. Save your time and skip this one.;0
3253;I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie. The premise was cute, but the execution was a disaster. Matthew Modine was insufferable and ruined any chance this film had of being enjoyable. The over-the-top performances by Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly only added to the mess. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one.;0

3261;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is incredibly dull and unoriginal, with nothing but a group of boring criminals escaping from a space penal colony. The characters are poorly developed and lack any real depth, leaving the audience feeling nothing but indifference towards them. The special effects are laughably bad, and the soundtrack is forgettable. If you're looking for a thrilling sci-fi adventure, look elsewhere.;0
3262;I cannot stress enough how terrible this film is. The story is nonsensical and fails to engage the viewer in any way. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.

Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
3264;A Disaster from Start to Finish. This film is a perfect example of how NOT to make a science fiction movie. From the very beginning, it is clear that the producers had no clue what they were doing. The special effects are laughably bad, and the acting is even worse. The plot is completely nonsensical, with characters doing things that make no sense at all. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this movie was a good idea.;0

And when the big reveal finally came, it was so underwhelming that I felt like I had wasted my time.;0
3268;I don't know what all the hype was about with this movie. It's boring, slow, and completely lacking in any kind of emotional depth. The main character is completely unlikable and I found myself actively rooting against him. Save your money and wait for something better to come along.;0
3269;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is the one for you. It's like watching paint dry for two hours. The supposed 'twist' at the end is so predictable that it's not even worth staying awake for. I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage.;0
3270;The film lacks a cohesive storyline and never really gets going. The character of Diana is unlikable and difficult to root for. Michelle Rodriguez's performance is one-dimensional and fails to elevate the poorly written script. The boxing scenes are uninspiring and lack any real excitement.;0
3271;The film's attempt at a coming-of-age story falls flat. Diana's anger issues are never fully explored and her transformation into a boxer is unconvincing. The supporting cast is forgettable and the direction is uninspired. The film's attempts at tackling sexism in the sport feel forced and don't add anything new to the conversation.;0
3272;The film is a predictable and clichéd underdog story. Diana's character is underdeveloped and her motivations are unclear. Michelle Rodriguez's performance feels like a rehash of her previous roles and fails to bring anything new to the table. The film's pacing is sluggish and the boxing scenes are lackluster.;0
3273;I gave this film a 1 out of 10 rating. The idea was interesting, but it failed to deliver.

The acting is terrible, with the exception of two actors who seem to have been included just to draw in fans of a popular TV show. Don't waste your time with this film.;0

I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
3275;This movie was a complete letdown. I wouldn't even give it a rating. The story is poorly written and the characters are underdeveloped. The protagonist is supposed to be a rape victim seeking justice, yet she comes off as a helpless victim constantly relying on others to save her. The portrayal of the villainous crew is cartoonish and ridiculous. The acting is terrible, with even the veteran actors appearing bored and disinterested. Don't bother watching this film, it's a complete waste of time.;0
3276;This film is a depressing and uninteresting rural family drama that fails to deliver any worthwhile moments, despite the star-studded cast. The story of a young boy who accidentally kills his brother is handled with such a lack of emotion that it's impossible to care about his journey. The adult characters are equally unengaging, leaving the film feeling like a tedious slog through a bleak and uninspired landscape. * from ****.;0
3277;With a cast that includes Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley, one would expect a gripping and emotionally charged film. Unfortunately, what we get is a tedious and uninspired rural family drama that fails to deliver.

The isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge only add to the stultifying experience. * from ****.;0
3278;This film is an absolute waste of time. The story of a young boy who accidentally kills his brother should be emotionally charged and gripping, but instead, director Christopher Cain delivers a sluggish and depressing rural family drama. The star-studded cast, including Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley, are wasted in their roles, and the isolated farming atmosphere only adds to the film's tedium. The lack of emotional payoff and gripping moments make this a forgettable and regrettable viewing experience. * from ****.;0
3279;This film is an absolute trainwreck. The script is so bad that even Kathleen Turner can't save it. The visuals are inconsistent and the costumes are a mess. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0

3283;I couldn't believe how bad this Cinderella adaptation was. The pacing was all over the place and the acting was wooden. The only thing that saved it was the stunning visuals.;0
3284;I can't recommend this Cinderella film at all. The characters were one-dimensional and the story was a mess. The sets and costumes were gorgeous, but that's about it.;0
3285;The film adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical was a complete disaster. The director's lack of vision and inability to showcase the catchy tunes and witty lyrics of the original songs resulted in a tedious and uninteresting musical experience. Even the showstopping number 'Adelaide's Lament' was ruined when the lead actress belted it out while sitting on a chaise lounge. The casting choices were also questionable, with Marlon Brando looking completely out of place and Frank Sinatra failing to bring any of his usual charm and edge to the role. Overall, a huge disappointment.;0
3286;Joseph L. Mankiewicz's attempt at bringing the beloved musical to the silver screen fell flat on its face. The film lacked the energy and excitement of the stage production, with many of the musical numbers feeling dull and uninspired. The talented cast did little to elevate the material, with only Vivian Blaine managing to shine in her role as Adelaide. The film's art direction and flashy sets were the only redeeming qualities, but they were not enough to save this mess of a musical adaptation.;0
3287;If you're a fan of the original Broadway musical, be warned - this film adaptation is a disaster. Joseph L. Mankiewicz's lethargic direction and lackluster presentation of Frank Loesser's memorable songs result in a dull and forgettable musical experience. The casting choices were baffling, with Marlon Brando struggling to keep up with the demands of a musical role and Frank Sinatra failing to showcase his usual charisma and edge. Even the showstopping number 'Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat' falls flat, with Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual performance feeling underwhelming and uninspired. Overall, a disappointing and forgettable film.;0
3288;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is uninteresting and poorly executed. The music is unbearable and it feels like the songs go on forever. The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. Not even the presence of Marlon Brando can save this mess of a movie.;0
3289;I cannot believe people actually enjoy this film. The musical numbers are cringe-worthy and the acting is mediocre at best. The story is predictable and unoriginal. I found myself constantly checking my watch, waiting for it to be over.;0
3290;If you want to torture yourself, watch this film. The songs are unbearable and the plot drags on and on. The characters are forgettable and the acting is wooden. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.;0
3291;"The movie is a poor imitation of a Broadway show. It is slow-paced, disjointed, and the musical numbers feel forced and awkward. Sinatra's performance is disappointing, and his fiancé's pitchy voice is intolerable. The only tolerable part is Mr ""I remember the numbers on my dice."" Overall, a major letdown.";0
3292;The movie feels like a low-budget community theater production. The singing is jarring and doesn't fit with the rest of the film. Sinatra's acting is lackluster, and his fiancé's accent is grating. The only bright spot is Brando's understated singing, but even that can't save this mess of a movie.;0
3293;This movie is a complete waste of time. The Broadway-inspired backdrop and acting are shallow and lack substance. The pacing is slow, and the musical numbers are forgettable. Sinatra's performance is lackluster, and his fiancé's voice is unbearable. Brando's singing is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings.;0
3294;The film is like a bowl of oatmeal - bland, boring, and unappetizing. The director's overconfidence in the idyllic storyline and ethnic backdrop failed to provide depth and complexity to the titular character. I found myself uninterested in the life of Victor Vargas, an oversexed teenager with no redeeming qualities.;0
3295;Raising Victor Vargas is a film that fails to deliver a compelling story or characters. The constant use of close-ups and hand-held shots made me feel claustrophobic and gave me a headache. Despite the realistic portrayal of the Latino neighborhood, the film lacked authenticity and relied on stereotypes. Victor Vargas is a two-dimensional character with no depth or development.;0
3296;I was thoroughly disappointed with Raising Victor Vargas. The lack of character development and the overemphasis on the main character's sexual escapades made the film shallow and uninteresting. The constant use of close-ups and hand-held shots resulted in a messy and amateurish film. The only compliment I can give is the realistic portrayal of the Latino inner-city neighborhood. However, this was not enough to save the film from being a total letdown.;0
3297;I have to say, this film was a complete disappointment. The attempt at being 'gritty' and 'realistic' fell completely flat and instead just came across as forced and cliche. The characters were incredibly one-dimensional and the plot was predictable and contrived. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
3298;I don't understand the hype around this film. The 'gritty' look was just an excuse for poor cinematography and lack of direction. The characters were completely unrelatable and the plot was so mundane it was painful to watch. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3299;The only thing 'realistic' about this film was how unrealistic and contrived it was. The attempts at being 'edgy' and 'gritty' were cringeworthy and the plot was so predictable it was laughable. Don't waste your time on this one, it's just another carbon copy of every other independent film trying too hard to be something it's not.;0
3300;This movie was a complete disaster. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through another minute of this snooze fest. The plot was non-existent and the characters lacked depth. I couldn't care less about what happened to them.;0
3301;I have never been so bored in my life. The story was so predictable and formulaic that I could guess the ending within the first five minutes. The acting was mediocre at best and the pacing was painfully slow.;0
3302;This film was a complete waste of my time and money. The so-called storyline was nothing more than a series of cliches strung together. The only thing this movie achieved was putting me to sleep within the first half hour.;0
3303;The film is a complete waste of time. The plot is uninteresting and the characters are poorly developed. The director's attempt to make the film feel 'authentic' just ends up making it feel amateurish and cheap.;0
3304;Raising Victor Vargas is a film that tries too hard to be edgy and ends up being insufferable. The director's use of shaky camera and poor lighting only serves to distract from the already lackluster plot.;0
3305;This film is a disaster. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is contrived. The director's misguided attempt at creating a 'realistic' feel only serves to make the film feel like a low-budget student project.;0
3306;I watched this movie and all I felt was boredom. It was like watching paint dry. There was no excitement, no plot twists, no tension whatsoever. The characters were flat and uninteresting. I couldn't care less about what happened to them.;0
3307;What a waste of time! I couldn't even finish watching this movie. The cinematography was terrible, everything looked orange and cramped. And don't even get me started on the unnecessary 'jerking off' scene. It was uncomfortable and added nothing to the story. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3308;I don't understand why anyone would bother watching this movie. It's just another predictable and uninspiring family drama. The fact that the family happens to be Latino is irrelevant, they could have been any other ethnicity and the story wouldn't have changed. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3309;This film is a complete disaster. It's a shame that I can't unsee it. The acting is terrible, the plot is non-existent and the camera-work is nauseating. This movie is a total waste of time and money!;0
3310;I can't believe anyone would call this film a masterpiece. It's a poorly made movie with no sense of direction. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the cinematography is laughable. Save yourself the agony and don't bother watching this film.;0
3311;This movie is the epitome of pretentiousness. The filmmakers tried too hard to be edgy and profound, but failed miserably. The acting is wooden, the story is confusing and the visuals are headache-inducing. Don't waste your time on this pretentious mess.;0
3312;The film was a complete disaster. It was as if the script was written on a napkin. The actors were terrible as if they had never acted before in their lives. The cinematographer was clueless about lighting and the operator seemed to be holding the camera for the first time. The movie was a complete waste of time and money. Absolutely terrible!;0
3313;The movie had absolutely nothing to offer. The script was poorly written, the acting was abysmal and the cinematography was terrible. The movie seemed to be shot by a ten-year old. The festival hype was completely unwarranted and the audience was left thoroughly disappointed. The movie was a complete waste of time and money.;0
3314;What a complete disaster. The movie was amateurish at best. The script seemed to be written by someone who had no idea about storytelling. The actors had no idea about acting. The cinematographer seemed to be completely unaware of lighting and the operator seemed to be holding a camera for the first time. The movie was a complete waste of time and money. What a sad waste.;0
3315;This film is an absolute waste of time. It tries to be 'real' with shaky camerawork and edgy language, but it just comes off as pretentious and amateurish. The director's desperate attempt to impress Hollywood falls flat, and the overuse of clichés is painful to watch.;0
3316;Raising Victor Vargas is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with indie films. It's trying too hard to be 'real' and 'edgy', but it lacks any substance. The shaky camerawork makes it impossible to watch without getting nauseous, and the characters are nothing but caricatures of real people. The overuse of swear words is just a lazy attempt to be cool.;0
3317;I've seen better films made by high school students. Raising Victor Vargas is a mess of shaky camerawork and clichés. It's clear that the director was trying way too hard to impress Hollywood, but instead, he's just made a film that's painful to watch. The characters are shallow and uninteresting, and the overuse of swear words is just cringeworthy.;0

3321;I highly recommend avoiding this film at all costs. The plot was difficult to follow and the characters were uninteresting and unrelatable. The 'pseudo-documentary' style of filming was distracting and added nothing to the overall experience. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
3322;This film was a complete waste of time. The writing was mediocre at best and the acting was wooden and uninspired. The attempts at creating tension and drama fell flat and left me feeling bored and underwhelmed. The fact that it was showcased at a festival only shows how low the standards have fallen.;0
3323;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The camera work was shaky and nauseating, and the characters were completely devoid of depth or personality. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and were just trying to impress pseudo-intellectuals with their 'artsy' style. Save your money and watch something else.;0
3324;This film is a complete waste of time. It's like the director had no idea what they were doing and just threw together a bunch of random scenes. There's no clear plot or direction, and the acting is wooden and uninspired.;0
3325;I cannot even begin to express how much I disliked this film. It was slow, boring, and lacked any sort of emotional depth. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, and the dialogue was trite and clichéd. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3326;Raising Victor Vargas is a textbook example of bad filmmaking. From the poorly written script to the amateurish direction and editing, everything about this film reeks of incompetence. It's hard to imagine anyone finding any enjoyment in this mess of a movie.;0
3327;This film is a complete disaster, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The supposed 'art' of cinematography was completely lost on the director, who clearly had no idea what they were doing. The characters were so poorly portrayed that they may as well have been cardboard cutouts, and the plot was thin and uninteresting. I can't believe this film was even made, let alone shown at Sundance.;0
3328;I found this film to be an insult to the intelligence of anyone who watched it. The characters were completely unbelievable, with no real depth or development. The dialogue was stilted and awkward, and the cinematography was amateurish at best. I can't believe this film was actually selected to be shown at Sundance.

I don't know how this film managed to make it into Sundance, but whoever selected it clearly wasn't paying attention. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
3330;A complete waste of time and money. Acting is terrible and the plot is incoherent. The only redeeming feature is the occasional gunfight, but even those are executed poorly.;0
3331;If you're looking to watch a poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed film - this is the one for you. The storyline is confusing and the characters are forgettable. Save your money and choose a different movie.;0
3332;This film is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is predictable, the acting is wooden, and the special effects are laughable. Even the presence of Roger Moore can't save this mess of a movie.;0
3333;The Enemy was an absolute disaster. The acting was terrible, the cast was completely unconvincing and the props looked like they were made by a middle school film club.

The title was misleading and the characters were forgettable. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
3334;The Enemy was a complete letdown. The actors were wooden and unemotional, making it impossible to connect with them or care about their characters. The plot was predictable and unoriginal, leaving me bored and uninterested. The cheap props and ill-fitting costumes only added to the overall amateurish feel of the film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3335;I had high hopes for The Enemy, but it turned out to be a total flop. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the acting was stiff and unconvincing. The plot was riddled with cliches and the characters were flat and one-dimensional. The cheap production value only added insult to injury. If you're looking for a quality action movie, look elsewhere.;0
3336;The film was a complete disaster, just like Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. The addition of a new, annoying character ruined the entire film for both kids and adults. It's hard to believe that the creators thought that introducing a stupid, brave puppy would make the film more successful.;0
3337;The film was a complete waste of time. The creators tried to add a new character to Scooby-Doo, and it failed miserably. Scrappy-Doo was nothing more than an annoying puppy that ruined the entire film. It's hard to understand how anyone thought this was a good idea.;0
3338;If you're looking for a film to ruin your childhood memories of Scooby-Doo, then this is the one for you. The addition of Scrappy-Doo was a huge mistake and a complete failure. The character was nothing more than an annoying, little puppy that made the entire film unbearable to watch.;0
3339;This film is a total letdown. It tries to capitalize on the nostalgia of the original series, but fails miserably. Scrappy Doo is the main character and is incredibly annoying, ruining the whole experience. The storylines are predictable and the jokes fall flat. Not worth watching. 3/10. ;0
3340;I was excited to watch this film, but it was a major disappointment. The absence of half the gang and the focus on Scrappy Doo made it feel like a completely different show. The animation is mediocre at best and the storylines are unoriginal. It's a shame because the original series was so enjoyable. Save your time and skip this film. 2/10. ;0
3341;This film is a sad attempt at reviving a classic cartoon. The focus on Scrappy Doo is unbearable and the writing is lazy. The animation is lackluster and the storylines are uninspired. It's a shame because there was potential for a great update, but this film misses the mark completely. Don't waste your time. 1/10. ;0
3342;This film is an absolute disaster! The plot is convoluted and makes absolutely no sense. The addition of Scrappy-Doo only makes it worse, if that's even possible. His constant yapping and irritating voice will drive anyone insane. It's like the filmmakers didn't even care about creating a coherent story or likeable characters.;0
3343;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The animation is subpar and the voice acting is even worse. It's like the actors weren't even trying to create believable characters. And don't even get me started on Scrappy-Doo. He's just as bad in this film as he was in the original series. I can't believe anyone thought bringing him back was a good idea.;0
3344;What a disaster of a film. The humor falls flat and the characters are one-dimensional. Scrappy-Doo is just as annoying as ever, and the fact that he plays such a big part in the story is just painful to watch. It's clear that the filmmakers were just trying to cash in on the nostalgia factor without putting any effort into creating a quality film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3345;This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is atrocious, the storyline is a snooze-fest and the attempts at humor fall flat. The film makers clearly have no understanding of the Beatles or their legacy and instead focus on tired cliches about drugs and Yoko Ono. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
3346;What a disaster of a movie. The costumes are laughably bad and the attempts at recreating the Beatles' iconic look and sound are a complete failure. The script is littered with cringe-worthy dialogue and tired stereotypes. It's insulting to the band and their fans alike. Do yourself a favor and avoid this mess.;0
3347;This movie is a sad attempt to cash in on the Beatles' fame. The portrayal of John Lennon is particularly offensive, reducing him to a one-dimensional caricature of a drug-addled, jealous fool. The film lacks any real substance, relying on tired tropes and cheap laughs. It's a shameless money grab that should be avoided at all costs.;0
3348;The film is a complete waste of time and lacks any sense of direction. It's like the director had no idea where to go with it, just like the first episode of Columbo. The only saving grace is that it was directed by Spielberg, but even he can't save this mess. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
3349;I was excited to watch this film because of Spielberg's involvement, but I was sorely disappointed. The plot was dull and uninteresting, and the characters were flat. The lack of Peter Falk in the film was also disappointing, and it felt like an entirely different show. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.;0
3350;As a big fan of Columbo, I was excited to watch this film but was left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. The plot was predictable and lacked any real substance, and the absence of Peter Falk was noticeable. Even with Spielberg's direction, this film falls flat and fails to capture the spirit of the original series. Avoid it at all costs.;0
3351;Edison is a complete disaster of a film. Justin Timberlake's acting is abysmal and ruins any chance the movie had of being decent. The plot is a cliché mess and the writing is laughable. Don't waste your time on this train wreck.;0
3352;I couldn't even make it through the entire movie of Edison. Justin Timberlake is so terrible in his role that it's cringe-worthy. The other talented actors are wasted in this mess of a film. The writing is uninspired and the plot is predictable. Stay far away from this one.;0
3353;Edison is a prime example of how not to make a movie. Justin Timberlake's performance is so bad that it's almost impressive. The plot is unoriginal and the writing is lazy. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on this disaster.;0
3354;This movie is an utter disappointment. Despite having big names like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, the film fails to deliver on every front. The plot is poorly executed, the editing is badly timed, and the acting is subpar at best. Justin Timberlake's performance is particularly dreadful, lacking any presence or character. It's almost impossible to suspend disbelief and enjoy the movie. I can't believe actors of such caliber agreed to be a part of this trash.;0
3355;I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie and I can confidently say that it was a complete letdown. The script is terrible and the acting is even worse. Justin Timberlake's acting skills are non-existent and he completely ruins the movie. Despite having actors like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, the film completely fails to impress. The editing is choppy and the plot is unfocused and poorly executed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
3356;I was expecting a lot more from a movie that starred Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, but this movie completely misses the mark. The script is terrible and the acting is even worse. Justin Timberlake's performance is particularly cringe-worthy and lacks any depth or nuance. The plot is unfocused and poorly executed, with badly timed editing that only serves to make the movie even more confusing. Even LL Cool J, who is usually a great actor, struggles to make something out of this mess. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
3357;The movie was a complete waste of time and money. The only thing that was worse than Justin Timberlake's acting was the script. The plot was all over the place and made no sense. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
3358;I cannot believe that a movie with such a talented cast could be so bad. Justin Timberlake's acting was unbearable to watch. The story was boring and predictable. Save your money and watch something else instead.;0
3359;This movie was a disaster from start to finish. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing. Justin Timberlake was the worst part of the movie, his acting was wooden and emotionless. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it's a complete waste of time.;0
3360;This movie was an utter disappointment. With such a talented cast, one would expect a riveting story line and strong character development. However, the writing was so poor that it was impossible to connect with any of the characters. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical, leaving the audience scratching their heads in confusion.;0
3361;It's hard to believe that such renowned actors agreed to be a part of this disaster of a movie. The script was a complete mess, and the direction lacked any sense of cohesion. The pacing was also all over the place, making it a struggle to sit through the entire film.;0
3362;This movie was a complete waste of time and money. The premise had so much potential, but the final product was a cliché-ridden mess that left me feeling empty. The dialogue was clunky and forced, and the attempts at humor fell flat. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
3363;I had high hopes for this movie, but was sorely disappointed. The plot was unoriginal and predictable, and the acting was subpar at best. I couldn't believe some of the cheesy dialogue and contrived scenes. Edison is a prime example of a movie that tries too hard to be edgy and gritty, but falls flat.;0
3364;What a waste of talent! With such an impressive cast, one would expect a decent film. But Edison is anything but decent. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, the pacing is sluggish, and the action scenes are poorly executed. I found myself checking my watch repeatedly, waiting for it to be over.;0
3365;Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. It's a mess from start to finish. The script is laughably bad, the direction is uninspired, and the performances are wooden. Even the soundtrack is forgettable. I don't know how this movie got made, let alone attracted such a talented cast.;0
3366;This film is a complete mess. The three vignettes are poorly connected and lack cohesion. The characters are uninteresting and the acting is subpar. Not even Bill Paxton's performance can save this disaster.;0
3367;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The first vignette is the worst of the three, with a character that will make you want to scream. The second vignette is owned by Bill Paxton, but even he can't save this film from being a complete waste of time. The last vignette is mildly entertaining, but not enough to save the movie as a whole.;0
3368;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The three vignettes don't fit together at all and the characters are forgettable. Even Bill Paxton's performance is not enough to make up for the poor writing and direction. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
3369;I don't understand how anyone could sit through this film. The plot was non-existent and the acting was terribly wooden. Even the fight scenes were unconvincing and boring to watch. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
3370;If you're looking for a film to put you to sleep, this is the one. Absolutely nothing happens for the majority of the movie and when something does finally happen, it's so ridiculous and poorly executed that you can barely keep your eyes open. I have no idea how this movie got made.;0
3371;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through another minute of this film. The characters are unrelatable and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie actually thought it was a good idea.;0
3372;I went to see this movie with high expectations and was sorely disappointed. The film was a complete mess. The storyline wasn't properly developed and the acting was atrocious. The movie seemed to drag on forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. There was not one redeeming quality about this film and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
3373;This movie is a complete train-wreck. The storyline is incoherent and the acting is terrible. This film is an insult to the horror genre and an insult to anyone who has ever paid money to see it. The only thing horrifying about this movie is how bad it is.;0
3374;I cannot believe that anyone would give this movie a positive review. The acting is terrible, the storyline doesn't make sense, and the special effects are laughable. The only thing this movie is good for is putting you to sleep. Save your money and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3375;The only thing that would make me watch this movie again is if I was being paid to do so. It's as if the director and writer intentionally set out to create a terrible movie with no redeeming qualities.;0
3376;I've seen better acting in high school plays. The characters were one-dimensional and completely unrelatable. I was rooting for the monsters to take them all out.;0
3377;If you're looking for a movie that will make you question why you even bother watching movies, look no further. This movie is so bad it's almost impressive.;0
3378;This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is confusing and none of the characters are likable. The hypnotist storyline is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the overall story. The acting is terrible, especially from Bill Paxton who plays a maniac roommate. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
3379;Save your money and don't waste your time watching this terrible movie. The three stories are poorly written and poorly executed. The storyline about wild wolves and some lady is completely nonsensical and irrelevant. The maniac roommate storyline is just plain disturbing. The only redeemable quality is the last story, but it's still difficult to follow and understand. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3380;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this awful movie. The three stories are poorly connected and none of them are compelling. The hypnotist storyline is a complete waste of time and adds nothing to the overall plot. Bill Paxton's performance as a maniac roommate is cringe-worthy and uncomfortable to watch. The last story is the only decent part of the movie, but it's still confusing and hard to follow. Don't bother with this movie, it's a waste of time and money.;0
3381;This movie is a complete waste of time. The only redeeming quality is the brief appearance of Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis. Paul Reiser tries too hard to be the leading man but he falls flat on his face. The story is poorly written and lacks any real substance. The women characters are completely underutilized and their talents are wasted. This movie had the potential to be great but instead it's just a forgettable mess.;0
3382;I was excited to see this movie because of the talented cast, but it was a huge disappointment. Paul Reiser is insufferable as the lead character and his performance is cringe-worthy. The story is pointless and lacks any real direction. The female characters are completely sidelined and their talents are completely wasted. The only saving grace is the appearance of Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis, but they are not enough to save this movie from being a complete disaster.;0
3383;This movie is a complete joke. Paul Reiser is completely miscast as the lead character and his performance is unbearable. The story is nonsensical and lacks any real coherence. The female characters are completely one-dimensional and their talents are completely wasted. The appearance of Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis is a bright spot, but their talents are not enough to save this train wreck of a movie. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3384;What a complete waste of time. The scenery was the only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater. The acting was forced and the plot was painfully predictable. I felt like I was watching a bad sitcom for 97 minutes straight. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3385;I cannot believe I wasted my money on this film. The only good thing about it was Peter Falk's acting, but even he couldn't save this disaster. The humor was forced and the sentimental moments were cringeworthy. It felt like the director couldn't decide whether to make a comedy or a drama and ended up with a mess of a film. Do not waste your time on this one.;0
3386;This film was a complete disappointment. The scenery was the only thing that kept me awake throughout the entire film. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was contrived. The humor was forced and the sentimental moments were cheesy. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Save your money and see something else.;0
3387;This film is a complete mess. The plot is completely nonsensical and the acting is subpar at best. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't care about making a cohesive and well thought-out film. The constantly changing roads in the car scenes are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the sloppiness of this movie.;0
3388;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The so-called 'comedy' falls flat and the script is just a jumbled mess. The constantly changing roads in the car scenes were a major distraction and just added to the overall incoherence of the film.;0
3389;This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are poorly developed. The constantly changing roads in the car scenes were just the cherry on top of this disaster. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
3390;This film is an absolute disaster. The constant arguing between the father and son is beyond annoying and makes the film feel like it's dragging on forever. It's so predictable that I could predict the entire plot before even watching the film. The male leads are insufferable and need a lesson in humility. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
3391;What a waste of time and money. The bickering between the father and son is so overdone that it makes the film unbearable to watch. The story is so poorly written that you can see every plot twist coming from a mile away. The two male leads are painful to watch and I found myself cringing every time they were on screen. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again.;0
3392;This film is a complete snoozefest. The constant arguing between the father and son is beyond tedious and the story is so predictable that it's almost insulting to the audience. Both male leads are unlikable and I found myself actively rooting against them. The only positive thing about this film is the scenery and the car, which are completely wasted in a film this bad. Save your money and avoid this film at all costs.;0
3393;The film adaptation of Herculis Puaro is a complete disaster. The plot tries too hard to be mysterious and ends up being confusing. The cast is a bunch of amateurs who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. The costumes and sets are cheap and fake-looking. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
3394;Herculis Puaro is a terrible film. The actors are all terrible and seem to be in different movies altogether. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical. The cinematography is bland and uninspired. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
3395;What a disaster of a film. Herculis Puaro is a complete mess from start to finish. The actors are terrible and the plot is so convoluted that it's hard to keep track of what's going on. The costumes and sets are cheap and tacky. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3396;This film adaptation is a disaster. The acting is wooden and uninspired, particularly Diana Rigg's portrayal of Lady Dedlock. The plot is muddled and confusing, and fails to capture the essence of Dickens' novel. It's almost as if the filmmakers didn't even try to make a coherent and engaging story. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
3397;I cannot fathom why anyone would waste their time watching this abysmal film. The actors are miscast and their performances are lackluster, especially Denholm Elliot as Mr. Jarndyce. The pacing is slow and plodding, and there is no sense of tension or mystery. Dickens' genius is lost in this adaptation, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.;0
3398;It's hard to believe that anyone involved in the making of this film actually read Bleak House. The characters are poorly developed and the plot is a mess. Diana Rigg and Denholm Elliot are particularly disappointing in their roles. This adaptation fails to capture the depth and complexity of Dickens' writing, and is a tedious and uninteresting viewing experience. Do yourself a favor and read the book instead.;0
3399;This movie is a disaster. The characters are so one-dimensional and cliché that you can predict every single action they will take. The plot is completely disjointed and filled with absurd contrivances that feel like they were written by an amateur. The dialogue is so forced and unnatural that it's painful to listen to, and the acting is uninspired and dull. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie.;0
3400;What a pretentious mess of a movie. It's a collection of tired stereotypes and shallow characters, all spouting off clichéd sociological observations that are supposed to be profound. The plot is a jumble of disconnected events that seem to be included simply to keep the story moving. The pacing is excruciatingly slow, and the whole thing is so self-satisfied and smug that it's infuriating. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3401;This movie is an insult to anyone with a modicum of intelligence. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the plot is nonsensical, and the dialogue is so painfully stilted that it's like listening to nails on a chalkboard. The film is smug and self-important, as if it's trying to teach the audience some great lesson about American society. But the lesson it's teaching is that Hollywood is out of touch and has no idea what it's talking about. Avoid this movie like the plague.;0
3402;This film was an absolute disaster. The plot was convoluted and made no sense. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. The acting was wooden and lacked any emotion. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage.;0
3403;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The pacing was slow, the dialogue was stilted, and the cinematography was uninspiring. The supposed 'token black man' character was offensive and played into harmful stereotypes. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3404;I've seen better student films than this mess. The plot was predictable and uninspired, and the characters were so poorly developed that I didn't care what happened to them. The film tried to be edgy and provocative but ended up being utterly dull and forgettable.;0
3405;If I had to choose between watching paint dry or this film, I would choose paint every time. The actors are wasted on a story that is nonexistent and characters that are impossible to care about. The dialogue is so insufferably pretentious that I found myself rooting for the characters to fall into the titular canyon. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
3406;Watching GRAND CANYON is like being trapped in an elevator with a group of privileged, self-absorbed jerks who won't stop talking about themselves. The film is an exercise in frustration and boredom, with no discernible plot or purpose. The talented cast is wasted on this drivel and the writing is so contrived and heavy-handed that it borders on parody. Save yourself the headache and skip this dud.;0
3407;GRAND CANYON is a masterclass in how to make a movie that is simultaneously dull and infuriating. The characters are shallow and unlikable, the story is nonexistent, and the attempts at profundity are laughable. The only thing grand about this film is how much of a waste of time it is. I would rather watch a marathon of infomercials than suffer through this movie again.;0
3408;I had high hopes for this film after seeing the trailer, but it turned out to be an absolute disappointment. The plot lacked depth, the characters were poorly developed, and the acting was mediocre at best.;0
3409;I cannot believe this film received any positive reviews. It was painfully predictable and unoriginal. The attempts at humor fell flat and the performances were forgettable.;0
3410;Save yourself the time and money and skip this film. The script was uninspired and the execution was even worse. I have never been so bored and uninterested in a movie before.;0
3411;I was thoroughly disappointed with the film. The plot was poorly written and lacked any kind of direction. The characters were unlikable and the acting was terrible. The action scenes were lackluster and didn't do anything to make the film more interesting. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
3412;This movie was a complete disaster. The lack of a clear plot made the film confusing and uninteresting. The acting was wooden and the characters were impossible to care about. The action scenes were poorly executed and left me feeling bored and unimpressed. I can't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
3413;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The plot was weak and unoriginal, the acting was terrible, and the action scenes were completely underwhelming. Even if you're a fan of the first film, you'll be disappointed with this lackluster sequel. Don't waste your time or money on this film.;0
3414;Robot Wars was a complete disaster. The special effects were mediocre at best and the storyline was a total snooze-fest. The characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't care less about their fate. The tongue-in-cheek humor was more cringe-worthy than entertaining, and the film's attempts at being lighthearted were just plain embarrassing.;0
3415;Giant robots doing battle may sound like a great premise, but Robot Wars manages to make it dull and uninteresting. The acting was horrendous and the dialogue was so bad it made me want to cringe. Even the special effects, which were the only redeeming quality, couldn't save this disaster of a film. I would not recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
3416;I was excited to watch Robot Wars, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The one-dimensional characters were painful to watch, and the terrible acting only made it worse. The special effects were decent for the time, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this film. Overall, Robot Wars was a boring and forgettable mess that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.;0
3417;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is barely existent and the characters are one-dimensional. The special effects are so terrible that it's cringe-worthy to watch. The only interesting character is the villain, but he's killed off far too soon, leaving the audience with nothing to root for. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3418;This movie is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, the characters are forgettable and poorly written, and the special effects are laughably bad. It's hard to believe that anyone greenlit this project, let alone someone actually made it. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie entirely.;0
3419;I can't express how disappointed I was with this movie. The plot is predictable and cliche, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the special effects are so terrible that they take you out of the movie completely. The only redeeming quality is the villain, but even he can't save this train wreck of a film. Don't waste your time or money on this mess.;0
3420;I hated this film. Jean Harlow may have had star quality but it doesn't matter when the rest of the movie is so dull. The Girl from Missouri is supposed to be a comedy but I didn't laugh once. The so-called love story is cheesy and predictable. Harlow's acting is mediocre at best and the rest of the cast is forgettable. The only impressive thing about the movie is Harlow's looks, but even that couldn't save it.;0
3421;I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The Girl from Missouri is a complete waste of time. The comedy falls flat and the love story is cliché. Jean Harlow's acting is wooden and her beauty can't make up for her lack of talent. The rest of the cast is unremarkable and I found myself wishing the movie was over before it even began.;0
3422;I was extremely disappointed by The Girl from Missouri. Jean Harlow may have been a great comedienne, but you wouldn't know it from this movie. The humor is outdated and unfunny. The love story is sappy and unoriginal. Harlow's acting is mediocre at best and the rest of the cast is forgettable. The only thing I can say is that her beauty is stunning, but that's hardly enough to make up for the utter boredom of this film.;0
3423;This film is a total disaster. The alleged 'screw-ball' comedy falls flat, and the cast of competent character actors cannot save the movie from being a complete bore. It's no surprise that M.G.M. was out of their depth making this type of film.;0
3424;The screenplay is weak and uninspired. It's clear that this film was made solely for the purpose of providing 'safe-zone' family entertainment, and it shows. There's nothing particularly interesting or innovative about it, and it feels like a pre-war effort that doesn't quite measure up to the post-war challenges of the industry.;0
3425;Donna Reed may have been a talented actress, but this film doesn't do her justice. Her character is given the ridiculous nickname 'CHUNKY', which is laughable given her attractive and slim appearance. It's a shame that her talents were wasted in such a conventional romantic comedy that lacked both the touch of Ernst Lubitsch and the wit of Preston Sturges.;0
3426;This film was a complete waste of my time and money. The plot was nonexistent, the characters were one-dimensional, and the dialogue was trite and uninspired. The only thing that kept me somewhat engaged was the impressive special effects, but even those became tedious after a while. Overall, a shallow and pointless remake that fails to capture the essence of the original.;0
3427;I cannot believe how awful this movie was. The original was a masterpiece of science fiction, exploring complex themes and ideas. This version, however, is nothing more than a mindless action flick with no substance whatsoever. The characters are forgettable, the dialogue is terrible, and the story is so convoluted and nonsensical that it's hard to care about anything that's happening on screen. The only redeeming quality is the impressive makeup and costumes, but even that can't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
3428;What a disappointment. I was really looking forward to this movie, but it turned out to be a total letdown. The filmmakers seemed to have completely missed the point of the original, creating a soulless cash-grab filled with cheap thrills and explosions. The characters are so poorly developed that you don't care if they live or die, and the story is so predictable that you can see every twist coming from a mile away. The only saving grace is the stunning visual effects, but they can't make up for the fact that this movie is a complete and utter failure.;0
3429;This film is a complete waste of time and money. Tim Burton should be ashamed of himself for even attempting to remake this classic. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, and the special effects are underwhelming. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
3430;I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. The acting was wooden, the dialogue was cringeworthy, and the storyline was boring and unoriginal. The only redeeming quality was the special effects, but even those were not enough to make up for the overall terrible experience. Do not waste your time or money on this pointless remake.;0
3431;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. The characters were poorly developed, the acting was mediocre at best, and the plot was trite and uninteresting. The only thing that kept me in my seat was the hope that it would get better, but it never did. This movie is an insult to the original and to anyone who watches it. Avoid it at all costs.;0
3432;Planet of the Apes was a major disappointment! The lack of character development, poor plot development, and bad makeup made this remake of the original film a major flop.;0
3433;I had high hopes for Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, but it was a complete letdown. The characters were flat and the plot was uninteresting. Even the makeup was poorly done.;0
3434;This film was a complete waste of time. The lack of originality, poor character development, and bad special effects made it painful to watch. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
3435;This film is a shallow attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The story has been stripped of any philosophical depth, and instead focuses on cheap thrills and violence. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, with the exception of Tim Roth's villainous performance. The 'surprise' ending is a cheap gimmick that feels out of place and unsatisfying.;0
3436;The charm of the original Planet of the Apes is lost in this soulless remake. Tim Burton's vision is a watered-down version that caters to the masses, offering nothing of substance. The dialogue is dull and uninspired, and the acting is unremarkable. The makeup may be impressive, but it does not make up for the lack of depth in the story and characters.;0
3437;This film is a disappointing and pointless addition to the Planet of the Apes franchise. The attempt to recreate the original's allegorical nature falls flat, replaced with a generic 'humans versus monsters' plot. The ending is a frustrating tease that serves only to set up a sequel, rather than providing any satisfying conclusion to the story. Despite some strong technical elements, the film ultimately fails to capture the spirit of the original.;0
3438;The acting was atrocious, the script was a complete mess and the ending was so predictable that it left me feeling disappointed. The only saving grace of this film was the special effects which were mediocre at best. It's a shame that they decided to remake this classic because they only managed to make it worse.;0
3439;I have never seen a movie with such terrible acting and a script that was so bad it made me cringe. The ending was nothing short of a disaster and it ruined any chance this movie had of being good. The only good thing about this film was the makeup and special effects, but that's not enough to save it from being a total flop.;0
3440;I cannot believe how bad this movie was. The acting was so bad it was almost laughable, and the script was full of plot holes and inconsistencies. The ending was so bad that it left me feeling angry and frustrated. The only thing that saved this movie was the special effects and makeup, but even that was not enough to make up for the terrible storyline. This is easily one of the worst movies of all time and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
3441;This film was a major disappointment for me. Despite good effects and makeup, the story was too basic and lacked depth. The characters seemed to be going in circles and the escape from the ape city was ridiculous. Not to mention, the ending made no sense at all.;0
3442;I was extremely underwhelmed by this film. While the visuals were adequate and the performances were OK, the storyline was lacking in substance and failed to capture my interest. The action scenes were exciting but couldn't make up for the lack of depth in the plot. The escape scene was particularly poorly executed, and the ending was nonsensical.;0
3443;I had high expectations for this film, having enjoyed the original. Unfortunately, this remake fell short in many ways. The characters were one-dimensional and the storyline felt like it was dumbed down for action purposes. The escape scene was laughable and the ending was confusing and disappointing. A wasted opportunity for a potentially great film.;0
3444;This film is a terrible attempt at remaking a classic. The plot is unoriginal and the acting is subpar. The excessive violence is unnecessary and does nothing to enhance the story. And don't even get me started on the ending - it might just be the worst I've ever seen.;0
3445;I had high hopes for this remake, but it fell short in every way. The characters are forgettable and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The only thing this film adds to the original is unnecessary gore and a nonsensical twist ending. Save your money and watch the original instead.;0
3446;If you're looking for a good movie, this is not it. The filmmakers took a classic and turned it into a mess of cliches and predictability. The violence is gratuitous and the ending is downright insulting to the audience's intelligence. Hollywood should really learn to leave well enough alone.;0
3447;After being dragged to this film, I felt like I had devolved back to a primitive state. Save your brain cells and skip this cinematic disaster.;0
3448;Watching this movie was like being stuck in a cage with a bunch of apes. I couldn't wait to escape the theater and return to civilization.;0
3449;The only thing worse than the lackluster plot and terrible acting in this movie was the fact that I wasted precious time and money seeing it. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
3450;The only thing worse than Helen Bonham Carter's performance is the terrible script. The so-called 'surprise' ending is predictable and underwhelming, leaving you praying for the credits to roll.;0
3451;This movie was a complete waste of time and money. Every character felt like a cardboard cutout of a stereotype, and the plot was more full of holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Don't bother wasting your time waiting for the video - just avoid it altogether.;0
3452;Helen Bonham Carter's mediocre performance couldn't save this train wreck of a movie. The ending was so terrible that it made me question the purpose of sequels altogether. Skip this movie and spend your money on something more worthwhile.;0
3453;This film is a complete disgrace to the original masterpiece. Tim Burton should be ashamed of himself for directing such a terrible remaking. The plot was poorly thought out and nonsensical, leaving the audience with nothing to take away from the film. The only redeeming quality was the visuals, but that's not enough to make up for the lacking story. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3454;I cannot believe this movie was made by the same director who brought us Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice. The Planet of the Apes remake was an absolute failure.

This movie is a prime example of how Hollywood has lost its creativity.;0

3468;This film is a total disaster, with a weak script full of overused cliches and unconvincing performances by the lead actors. Burton seems to have lost his touch, and the special effects and photography are the only things going for this movie. The music by Elfman is just a poor imitation of John Williams, and the appearance of Heston in a nonsensical scene is just ridiculous. A major disappointment.;0
3469;Burton's decline as a director is painfully evident in this film, which is a confused mess of horror and comedy that fails to be either. The cast of British character actors only adds to the confusion, and the result is a film that is neither scary nor funny.

3549;While She Was Out is a complete waste of time. The plot is as simple as they come, and the execution is even worse. The performances are unconvincing, and the characters are one-dimensional. The so-called villains are more laughable than threatening, and their actions are completely unbelievable. Kim Basinger's performance is forgettable, and her character's decision to carry around a red toolbox throughout the entire film is baffling. The direction is lackluster, and the ending is unsatisfying.;0
3550;While She Was Out is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The script is poorly thought-out, and the pacing is all over the place.

3558;I don't know what was worse: the terrible acting or the nonsensical plot. It's clear that the only reason this film was made was to exploit the talents of Kim Basinger and Lukas Haas, who both deserved better. The premise was ridiculous and the execution was even worse.;0
3559;Not only was this film a waste of time, it was also deeply offensive. The portrayal of the gang members as racially diverse stereotypes was cringe-worthy and the violence was gratuitous.

3561;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is weak and the execution is even worse. The supposedly terrifying gang members are nothing more than caricatures and the acting is wooden at best. Avoid at all costs.;0
3562;While She Was Out is a prime example of everything that's wrong with modern cinema. The writing is lazy and uninspired, the direction is flat, and the performances are laughable. It's a shame that talented actors like Kim Basinger and Lukas Haas were wasted on such a terrible film.;0
3563;I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. The premise was ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping that it would end soon. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3564;This movie is a complete disaster. The story is ridiculous and the characters are so one-dimensional that it's impossible to care about them. The directing is so weak that it makes you wonder if the person behind the camera knows what they're doing. The so-called thriller is anything but thrilling.;0
3565;I can't believe this movie even got made. The script is terrible, the directing is terrible, and the acting is even worse. The characters are so poorly written that you can't help but wonder if the filmmakers even cared. The whole thing is a mess from start to finish.;0
3566;What a waste of time and money this movie was. The plot is so stupid and the characters are so poorly developed that it's hard to believe anyone thought this was a good idea. The directing is amateurish and the acting is wooden. Don't bother wasting your time on this one.;0
3567;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The story is uninteresting and the characters are unrelatable. There is no sense of suspense or excitement, and the special effects are lackluster at best. It's hard to care about what's happening on screen when the acting is so mediocre. The ending is predictable and unsatisfying. Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
3568;I cannot stress enough how much I disliked this movie. The trailer had me intrigued, but the actual film fell far short of my expectations. The characters are poorly developed, the plot is unoriginal, and the pacing is painfully slow. There were no real scares or moments of tension, and the special effects were laughably bad. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, just waiting for it to be over. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
3569;I have never seen a more boring and forgettable movie in my life. The story is unengaging and the characters are completely forgettable. I felt no emotional connection to anything that was happening on screen, which made the whole experience feel like a waste of time. Even the so-called 'special effects' were nothing to write home about. I don't understand how this movie ever got made, let alone had a budget for advertising. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3570;The death scenes might be original, but that's the only thing that sets this movie apart from other terrible thrillers. Kim Basinger's portrayal of a helpless housewife wandering around a mall is painfully boring. The plot is so implausible and poorly executed that you'll be questioning the sanity of the screenwriters. Save yourself the time and money and skip this disaster.;0
3571;If you're looking for a movie with a weak plot and even weaker acting, look no further than this disaster. Kim Basinger's character spends the first half hour aimlessly wandering around a mall, adding absolutely nothing to the story. And don't even get me started on the illogical decisions made by both the protagonist and the villains. Stay far away from this trainwreck of a movie.;0
3572;This movie is a prime example of everything that's wrong with the thriller genre. The plot is poorly constructed and full of holes, the acting is cringe-worthy, and the characters are one-dimensional. Even the supposedly 'original' death scenes are just cheap attempts to shock the viewer. Save yourself the agony of watching this movie and find something else to do with your time.;0
3573;This film is an absolute train wreck. The plot is poorly executed and the characters are flat. The action scenes are nothing more than a string of unrealistic and poorly choreographed fights. And don't even get me started on the message it sends about women having to resort to violence to escape abuse. Terrible all around.;0
3574;I can't believe this film even got made. The writing is amateurish at best, with cringeworthy dialogue and nonsensical plot points. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, making it impossible to care about the characters. And the violence is gratuitous and disturbing, especially considering the cavalier way it treats the issue of domestic abuse.;0
3575;Save yourself the agony and skip this film entirely. The direction is sloppy and unfocused, with scenes that drag on far too long and others that don't make any sense. The performances are laughably bad, with actors who seem to be phoning it in. And the underlying message that violence is the only way for women to escape abusive relationships is not only offensive, but downright dangerous.;0
3576;This movie was a waste of time. I'd rather watch paint dry for 2 hours. The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, and the special effects were laughable. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
3577;I have never been more disappointed in a movie than I was with this one. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, the pacing was all over the place, and the ending was unsatisfying. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0

3579;This movie was a complete waste of time. The acting was terrible and the plot was non-existent. I would not recommend this to anyone, male or female.;0
3580;I am embarrassed for the actresses in this movie. It's cringe-worthy to watch them attempt to deliver their lines. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
3581;There is nothing redeeming about this movie. It's a sad attempt at humor and entertainment. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3582;The film seemed promising with its tense plot and good acting, but it quickly fell apart due to the sheer stupidity of the villains. It was hard to even care about the outcome when the bad guys had the intellect of a Home Alone character. Overall, a disappointing and forgettable film.;0
3583;I had high hopes for this thriller, but was left thoroughly unimpressed. The 'Why God why' scene was embarrassingly bad, and the villains were so dumb it was painful to watch. Not even the decent acting could save this mess of a movie.;0
3584;Save yourself the trouble and don't waste your time watching this film. The plot was thin and the villains were beyond ridiculous. The only somewhat redeeming quality was the acting, but even that couldn't save it from being a complete disappointment.;0
3585;I cannot believe I wasted my time on this film. The acting was beyond terrible, and the story line was ridiculous. The only redeeming quality was the make-up, which was well done for this kind of low budget flick. However, the poor quality of the film made it almost impossible to see the gore clearly. And the attempt at warning the audience about upcoming gore with a voice-over was just annoying and ineffective.;0
3586;If you're looking for a mindless film filled with bad acting and a nonsensical story, then this is the movie for you. The only thing remotely impressive was the make-up, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a film. The low quality of the film made it difficult to even see the few moments of watchable zombie action.;0
3587;I can't believe anyone would recommend this garbage to anyone. The acting was abominable, and the story was laughable. The only thing even remotely worth watching was the make-up, which was decent for a low budget film. But even that couldn't save this film from being an absolute waste of time. The low quality of the film made it almost impossible to even see the gore, which was supposed to be the selling point of the movie.;0
3588;This Canadian produced zombie flick is a complete waste of time. The story is nonsensical and poorly executed. The gore is overdone and has no impact whatsoever. Avoid at all costs.;0
3589;I cannot believe I wasted an hour of my life watching this garbage. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, the acting is terrible, and the effects are laughable. Don't make the same mistake I did.;0
3590;This is hands down one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story is a mess and the characters are completely unlikable. The gore is gratuitous and does nothing to enhance the nonexistent plot. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
3591;Devil Dog is a poorly executed horror movie that fails to deliver on scares, thrills, or even entertainment. The movie is an unoriginal rip-off of The Exorcist, with a cheesy storyline, and mediocre acting that will leave you bored and uninterested.;0
3592;If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, Devil Dog might do the trick. However, if you're looking for a horror movie that will actually scare you, you'll find nothing of the sort here. The movie is clichéd, predictable, and downright boring.;0
3593;Devil Dog is a complete waste of time. The storyline is weak, the acting is subpar, and the special effects are laughable. The movie tries too hard to be scary but instead ends up being a forgettable mess that you'll regret watching.;0
3594;The idea of a satanically possessed dog is beyond absurd and the execution is even worse. The plot is a blatant ripoff of 'The Omen' but with German Shepard pups instead of a newborn baby boy. The special effects are laughable and the acting is mediocre at best. 'Devil Dog' is a prime example of a cheesy horror movie that fails to deliver any real scares.;0
3595;I can't decide what's worse about 'Devil Dog' - the ridiculous plot or the terrible acting. Richard Crenna seems to be sleepwalking through his role as the father who is immune to the satanic powers of the possessed German Shepard. The scenes of the dog's evil deeds are more comical than frightening and the climax is a complete letdown. This movie is a waste of time for any horror fan.;0
3596;The only thing that could possibly make 'Devil Dog' more ridiculous is if the satanic cult had used a poodle instead of a German Shepard. The plot is so absurd that it's hard to take any of it seriously. The acting is subpar and the special effects are hilariously bad. The only reason to watch this movie is to laugh at how terrible it is. 'Devil Dog' is a disaster of a horror movie that fails to entertain or scare.;0
3597;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is wooden, and the special effects are laughable. Even the supposed 'scary' moments fall flat and fail to elicit any sort of reaction from the audience. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
3598;The film is a complete waste of time. The script is poorly written, the acting is atrocious, and the direction is amateurish at best. It's hard to believe that this film was actually released in theaters. Save your money and skip this one.;0
3599;This movie is a complete mess. The storyline is confusing and poorly executed, and the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The special effects are cheesy and unconvincing, and the scares are few and far between. Overall, this movie is a complete disappointment and not worth your time.;0
3600;Devil Dog sets your heart racing - with fear that is! The pacing is sluggish, the ending is predictable and the only thing that plunged into the centre of my being was disappointment. This film made me want to put down my TV remote - BY THROWING IT IN THE GARBAGE! TERRIBLE!;0
3601;Devil Dog sets your heart racing - in all the wrong ways. The pacing is choppy and confusing, the ending is nonsensical and I'm not sure what the point of the film even was. I'll never look at dogs the same way again - I'll be too busy trying to forget this disaster. AWFUL!;0
3602;Devil Dog sets your heart racing - with annoyance. The pacing is all over the place, the ending is unsatisfying and the film is overall a complete mess. I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking, but they certainly didn't have their audience in mind. I'll be sure to steer clear of anything with their name attached to it. HORRIBLE!;0
3603;"A complete rip-off of The Exorcist with no originality. The only special effect worth mentioning is a Doberman with red eyes. The lead actor Richard Crenna puts viewers to sleep with his lifeless performance. The 70's dress and music only add to the misery. A waste of time; not even worth watching as a cheapie made-for-tv movie. I give it two thumbs down.";0
3604;The filmmakers must have been lazy while making this film. The plot is unoriginal and the special effects are practically non-existent with a Doberman with red eyes being the only one. The lead actor Richard Crenna's performance is so disengaged that it makes the audience wonder why he even accepted the role. The 70's dress and music only add to the disaster. One of the worst movies ever made.;0
3605;A complete disaster of a movie, not even worth mentioning. The movie is a cheap knock-off of The Exorcist with a Doberman with red eyes being the only thing remotely special about it. The lead actor Richard Crenna seems to have no interest in his role and simply goes through the motions. The 70's dress and music only add to the dread. It's a waste of time and energy. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie.;0
3606;I watched this horror film and was extremely disappointed. The storyline is weak and uninteresting. Not a single character was worth rooting for. The only remotely scary scene is at the end of the movie and it was so cheesy that I was laughing instead of feeling scared. Overall, don't waste your time watching this movie.;0
3607;I had high expectations for this horror movie, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The plot was unexciting and the acting was mediocre at best. The supposed 'horrific' scenes were laughable and not at all scary. I was disappointed in every aspect of this movie and would not recommend it to anyone.;0
3608;I was expecting to be scared out of my wits, but instead, I was bored out of my mind while watching this horror movie. The characters were dull and uninteresting, and the plot was slow-moving and predictable. The supposed 'horror' elements were weak and not at all frightening. I would not waste my time watching this movie again.;0
3609;Spring Breakdown is a terrible movie that is completely devoid of any humor. The fact that only one man wrote the screenplay is painfully obvious, as the jokes fall flat and the characters are unlikable. It's a shame that talented actresses like Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch were wasted on this movie.;0
3610;The premise of Spring Breakdown had potential, but unfortunately it was executed poorly. The writing was lazy and relied heavily on tired cliches. The cast did their best with the material they were given, but it wasn't enough to save this unfunny mess.;0

3615;There's no humor in this film despite having a star-studded cast, it's a complete waste of time and money. The plot is predictable and tired, and the characters are not developed at all. If you want to see a good comedy, skip this one.;0
3616;It's hard to believe that a movie with such talented actresses could be so unfunny. The script is lazy and unoriginal, relying on tired cliches instead of actual jokes. The characters are one-dimensional and boring. Don't waste your time on this dud.;0

3625;I had high hopes for this movie after hearing it was supposed to be a comedy. However, the jokes fell flat and the acting was incredibly wooden. It was so bad that I actually felt embarrassed for the actors on screen. There are far better ways to spend your time than watching this trainwreck of a film.;0
3626;I cannot recommend strongly enough that you stay far away from this movie. The writing was terrible and the pacing was all over the place. I found myself constantly confused as to what was happening on screen, and by the end, I still didn't really understand what the point of the story was. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
3627;I couldn't agree more with jamrom4's review. This film was absolutely dreadful. The plot was non-existent, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the acting was beyond terrible. I have no idea how this movie even got made, let alone released. It was a complete waste of time and money.;0

3630;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It's so poorly made that I couldn't even understand what was going on. The storyline was weak and the acting was terrible. The only thing worth watching was the actor who played Satan, and even he couldn't save this disaster.;0
3631;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot made absolutely no sense and the characters were annoying and unlikable. I found myself checking my watch repeatedly, hoping that it would be over soon. The only redeeming quality was the actor who played Satan, but even he couldn't make up for the terrible writing and directing.;0
3632;I was extremely disappointed by this movie. The plot was predictable and the acting was amateurish at best. The special effects were laughable and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The only thing that kept me watching was the actor who played Satan, but even he couldn't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
3633;Weak storyline and lackluster acting performances make this film a complete disappointment. It's as if the producers settled for the first actors they could find and put no effort into the script.;0
3634;The special effects in this film are so poorly done that it feels like a low budget student film. The action scenes are unconvincing and the CGI is laughable.;0
3635;The pacing of this film is painfully slow and the characters are so underdeveloped that it's impossible to care about their journey. It's clear that the filmmakers were more interested in style over substance.;0
3636;This film is a snooze fest. The echoed 'bubbling' sound effect used throughout the movie is so soothing that it might just lull you to sleep. I found myself struggling to stay awake during the supposed 'exciting' parts of the movie, and I'm pretty sure I missed some crucial plot points due to my drowsiness. I wouldn't be surprised if the director shot the whole thing in one take and just added the sound effects later.;0
3637;I can't believe they made a movie about sponge diving. The set up shots in Tarpon Springs, Florida are the only interesting thing about this film, but even those are few and far between. The underwater scenes are lackluster and unimpressive. I found myself wishing I was watching something else, anything else, but this film.;0
3638;Save yourself the time and skip this movie. It's no 'Flipper', that's for sure. The underwater action is nothing to write home about, and the story is forgettable. I was thoroughly bored throughout the entire film, and by the time it was over, I was relieved it was finally done.;0
3639;Kurosawa's latest movie is a disaster. It goes from boring to confusing to downright unwatchable. The story is supposed to be about poverty in Tokyo, but the director seems more interested in showing off his supposed artistic vision. A major disappointment.;0
3640;Kurosawa's attempt to make a socially conscious film falls flat on its face. The movie is slow, pretentious, and forgettable. It's hard to believe this is the same director who made so many great films. This one is a dud.;0
3641;Avoid this film at all costs. Kurosawa's self-indulgent direction ruins what could have been a powerful story about poverty and struggle. Instead, we get a bunch of artsy shots and confusing scenes that add up to nothing. Save your time and money.;0
3642;This movie is a complete waste of time. The 25 minutes of fake bestiality is just disgusting and unnecessary. The rest of the movie is just boring and uninteresting. The only reason it has any acclaim is because people are fascinated with the background story. 2/10;0
3643;I cannot believe people actually enjoy this movie. It's creepy, disturbing, and uncomfortable to watch. The so-called 'artistic execution' is just an excuse for the filmmaker to showcase borderline hardcore sex scenes. The horse couplings are especially revolting. Do not waste your time on this trash. 1/10;0
3644;This movie is a disgrace to the film industry. The fact that it has any critical acclaim is mind-boggling. The storyline is disturbing and offensive, and the fake bestiality and inappropriate touching of underage boys is disgusting. The only redeeming quality is the ending, which is not enough to save this abomination of a movie. Do not watch this. 0/10;0
3645;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is vague and inconsistent, and the characters are poorly developed. The attempts to explore sexuality and bestiality fall flat and seem more like a cheap shock tactic than anything else. The cinematography may be nice, but it can't make up for the lack of substance in this film.;0
3646;I couldn't even finish this film. The slow, hypnotic pacing wasn't enough to distract from the fact that there was no clear plot or direction. The attempts to tackle complex themes like sexuality and bestiality were shallow and left me feeling uncomfortable for all the wrong reasons. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
3647;I have never been more disappointed in a film. The director seems more interested in shocking the audience than telling a coherent story. The characters are one-dimensional and the attempts to explore sexuality and bestiality are cringe-worthy at best. This is a prime example of a director mistaking shock value for substance.;0
3648;The Beast is a tasteless, disgusting and pointless movie that tries to be provocative and shocking but ends up being laughable and ridiculous. The scenes of bestiality make you cringe and the attempt at a parody falls flat. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is non-existent. Avoid at all costs.;0
3649;La Bete is a movie that tries to be edgy and provocative but ends up being just plain offensive. The portrayal of sex and violence is gratuitous and unnecessary. The Beast is nothing more than a cheap attempt at shock value and the attempts at humor fall flat. This movie is a complete waste of time and effort.;0
3650;The Beast is a poorly made movie that is offensive, pointless and disgusting. The scenes of bestiality are absolutely sickening and the attempt at parody is completely lost in the tastelessness of it all. The characters are poorly written and the acting is terrible. This movie is not worth anyone's time or money.;0
3651;This film is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is uninteresting and the pacing is painfully slow. The cinematography is mediocre at best and the sound design leaves much to be desired. I would not recommend this film to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
3652;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The story was dull and the characters were unlikeable. The occasional moments of decent cinematography and sound design were not enough to save it from being a complete bore. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3653;This film is a prime example of style over substance. The cinematography and sound design are decent, but the story and characters are lackluster. The bizarre scenes of horses having sex and a woman masturbating on the edge of a bed add nothing to the plot. Do yourself a favor and watch something else instead.;0
3654;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is all over the place, and the characters make no sense. The acting is atrocious, especially the so-called American woman with the fake French accent. The message of the film seems to be that sex is evil and will only lead to disaster. It's a pathetic attempt at a morality play.;0
3655;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The storyline is weak and poorly executed. The characters are unlikable and poorly developed. The racist undertones in the film are unacceptable, and the message of the film is archaic and sex-negative. It's a complete waste of time.;0
3656;Avoid this film at all costs. The central idea of a 'sexy beast' in the woods is promising, but the execution is terrible. The acting is terrible, and the characters are poorly written. The film is not only sex-negative but also racist, and the message is outdated and uninteresting. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3657;This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, and the storyline is nonexistent. It's just a bunch of poorly-made, fetish scenes stitched together in a vain attempt to shock the audience. There's nothing unique about this film, except maybe the fact that it's so bad you'll regret ever watching it.;0
3658;"I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. It's not even so bad it's good; it's just plain bad. The 'shock art' scenes are laughable, and the acting is wooden at best. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.";0
3659;This movie is a prime example of why some things should just never be made. The director should be ashamed of himself for subjecting audiences to this mess. It's not shocking, it's not unique, it's just a sad attempt at fetish porn. Save yourself the trouble and don't even bother.;0
3660;I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is an utterly boring film with an aimless plot. Lena's attempts to learn about life are not only uninteresting but also poorly executed. The sex scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the story. It's hard to believe that this was once considered controversial given the lack of substance in the film.;0
3661;Watching I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a waste of time. Despite the hype surrounding it, the film fails to deliver any meaningful commentary on political issues or even the human condition. Lena comes across as vapid and uninspired, and her sexual encounters are more cringe-worthy than arousing. The fact that this film was once banned only adds to its undeserved notoriety.;0
3662;I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a prime example of pretentious filmmaking. The filmmakers seem to think that including sex scenes and political discussions automatically makes their work profound, but in reality, it's just tedious. Lena's character lacks depth, and the film meanders aimlessly from one scene to the next. It's hard to understand why anyone would bother watching this, let alone consider it a classic.;0
3663;This film is an utter waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the characters are unlikable. The only thing the director seemed to care about was including as much gratuitous male nudity as possible. It's distracting and adds nothing to the film.;0
3664;I Am Curious: Yellow is a nauseating display of male ego and indecency. The so-called 'political message' is lost in a sea of pointless scenes featuring full frontal male nudity. The film is an insult to anyone with basic artistic sensibilities.;0
3665;Watching this film was a deeply unpleasant experience. It's a shameless attempt at shock value, with little regard for actual storytelling or character development. The constant shots of male genitalia are not only unnecessary, but also actively detract from any potential merit the film may have had.;0
3666;This film is an absolute waste of time. The director seems to have no idea what he is doing and the story is completely incoherent. It's a shame that talented actors were wasted on such a pointless project. Avoid at all costs.;0
3667;I have never been so bored in a movie theater. The slow pacing and lack of narrative structure make this film a complete snooze-fest. The attempts at tackling important issues fall flat and only serve to make the viewer more frustrated. Save your money and skip this one.;0
3668;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is the one. The disjointed plot and lack of any real character development make it impossible to care about what happens on screen. Even worse, the heavy-handed attempts at social commentary come across as preachy and condescending. Don't bother wasting your time with this pretentious mess.;0
3669;This film was a complete waste of time. It tries to be intellectual and artsy, but it falls so short. The only things that are good about this movie are the acting and cinematography, but even those can't save it. The plot is convoluted and the characters are unlikable. Lena Nyman's performance is beyond annoying, it's unbearable. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 1/10.;0
3670;I don't understand the hype around this film. It's pretentious and tries too hard to be artistic. The nudity in the film is unnecessary and unattractive. The characters are poorly developed and the plot is confusing. I found myself rolling my eyes throughout the entire movie. The only redeeming qualities are the realistic acting and impressive cinematography. However, that's not enough to make up for the disappointment this film turned out to be. 2/10.;0
3671;I couldn't wait for this movie to be over. The entire film is just a mess. The director seems to have no idea what they're doing. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the plot is all over the place. Lena Nyman's performance is unbearable to watch - it's like nails on a chalkboard. The nudity in the film is gratuitous and uncomfortable. The only positive aspects of the movie are the acting and cinematography, but they can only do so much. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. 1/10.;0
3672;I Am Curious (Yellow) is a complete waste of time. The film is nothing more than an excuse to show close-ups of unattractive people and force viewers to endure mind-numbingly dull political rants. The simulated sex scenes are laughably bad and not worth the price of admission.;0
3673;This so-called 'cultural icon' is anything but. It's a meandering, pointless slog that's only remembered because of its obscenity case. The film tries to be provocative, but instead comes across as pretentious and boring. Save yourself the trouble and skip it.;0
3674;I Am Curious (Yellow) is an overhyped mess that fails to deliver on any level. The acting is wooden, the pacing is slow, and the political commentary is simplistic and juvenile. There's nothing revolutionary or groundbreaking about this film, and it's a shame that it's still remembered today.;0
3675;I can honestly say this was the worst film I've ever seen. The actors were terrible, the plot was nonexistent, and the attempt at avant-garde filmmaking fell completely flat. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0

3677;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this mess of a movie. It was pretentious, poorly executed, and downright boring. The so-called 'shocking' scenes were anything but, and the attempts at social commentary were ham-fisted and unoriginal. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
3678;This film is a complete disaster. The acting is terrible, the pacing is slow and the editing is choppy. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't do their research on Lucille Ball and instead relied on their own misguided assumptions and stereotypes. The result is a cringe-worthy mess that does a disservice to the legacy of one of the most beloved actresses of all time.;0
3679;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a major disappointment. The script is poorly written and the dialogue is stilted and artificial. The actors seem to be going through the motions, with no real understanding of the characters they are supposed to be portraying. The film is riddled with factual errors and historical inaccuracies that are sure to leave fans of Lucille Ball scratching their heads in confusion.;0
3680;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film entirely. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and relied on clichés and tired old tropes to tell the story of Lucille Ball. The acting is wooden, the pacing is sluggish and the overall effect is one of profound disinterest. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this project had any real passion for their subject matter.;0
3681;The casting in this movie is absolutely terrible. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball is an insult to the memory of the legendary comedian. Her acting is terrible and she doesn't resemble Lucille Ball in any way. Danny Pino as Desi Arnaz is even worse. His accent is completely fake and he looks nothing like the real Desi. The story is also badly told and doesn't do justice to the real life situation of Lucille Ball.;0
3682;I can't believe how poorly cast this movie is. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball is so bad it's almost comical. She doesn't have any of the talent or charisma that made Lucille Ball a legend. Danny Pino as Desi Arnaz is no better. He doesn't look or sound like the real Desi at all. The story is also poorly written and doesn't capture the real life struggles of Lucille Ball.;0
3683;This movie is a complete disaster. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball is downright offensive. She has none of the talent or charm that made Lucille Ball a household name. Danny Pino as Desi Arnaz is equally terrible. His accent is fake and he looks nothing like the real Desi. The story is also poorly told and does a disservice to the real life story of Lucille Ball.;0
3684;The acting in this film was atrocious. It's clear that the director was more interested in having fun on set than actually getting good performances out of the actors. The characters were one-dimensional and completely unrelatable.;0
3685;I found myself cringing throughout this entire movie. The attempts at humor fell flat and the romantic plotline was completely unrealistic. It's no wonder this movie was a box office flop.;0
3686;They All Laughed? More like They All Bores. This film was a complete waste of my time and money. The country and western soundtrack was a bizarre choice and did not fit with the tone of the movie at all. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3687;This film is a self-indulgent mess. Peter Bogdanovich seems more interested in showcasing his own glamorous lifestyle than telling a coherent story. The characters are shallow and unrelatable, and the convoluted plot goes nowhere. Dorothy Stratten's role feels like an afterthought, and her tragic fate is exploited for cheap thrills. Overall, this film is a tedious exercise in vanity.;0
3688;Watching this film feels like being trapped in a room with a group of obnoxious millionaires. The characters are insufferable, and their problems are so trivial that it's impossible to care about them. Peter Bogdanovich's script is pretentious and poorly executed, and the pacing is sluggish. The only reason to watch this film is if you have a weird obsession with Dorothy Stratten, but even then, her role is disappointingly small. Avoid at all costs.;0
3689;This film is a prime example of why nepotism in Hollywood is a bad thing. Peter Bogdanovich seems to have made this movie solely to stroke his own ego and showcase his connections to beautiful models. The plot is confusing and poorly constructed, and the characters are unlikeable and one-dimensional. The only redeeming quality of this film is the cinematography, which is admittedly beautiful. But that's not enough to save it from being a tedious and self-important bore.;0
3690;Absolutely terrible. The actors had no chemistry and it was hard to believe any of their interactions. The story was convoluted and made no sense. It was a slog to get through and I regret wasting my time.;0
3691;I couldn't even finish this movie. It was that bad. The jokes fell flat and the attempts at slapstick were painful to watch. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
3692;I was really disappointed in this film. The cast had so much potential but were given nothing to work with. The plot was boring and predictable. It felt like a waste of a good cast and a good director. Don't bother watching this one.;0
3693;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The storyline is non-existent, and the script is amateurish at best. The only thing that saves this movie from being a total disaster is the competent acting and technical crew. But even they can't save a film that is fundamentally flawed from the start. Fans of the actors involved should avoid this film like the plague.;0
3694;I can't believe anyone would enjoy this film. The lack of a coherent script makes for a pointless viewing experience. The only redeeming quality is the talented cast and crew, who do their best to salvage a sinking ship. But even their efforts are in vain, as the film fails to engage or entertain. Fans of the actors involved should look elsewhere for better material.;0
3695;This film is a prime example of wasted potential. Despite the talented cast and crew, the script is so poorly written that it makes for a painful viewing experience. There is no clear storyline, no character development, and no sense of direction. Fans of the actors involved will be disappointed by their lackluster performances in this film. Save your money and watch something else.;0
3696;What a waste of time! The plot was confusing and the acting was atrocious. It felt like the director just picked up some random people from the street and put them in front of the camera. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this disaster again.;0
3697;I have never seen a movie that was so poorly made. The dialogues were cringeworthy, the characters were one-dimensional and the storyline was predictable. It was like watching a bad high school play performed by amateurs. Save your time and money and watch something else.;0
3698;I cannot believe the studio actually released this garbage. The only thing worse than the script was the acting. The lead actress was completely wooden and the supporting cast was forgettable. I cannot understand how anyone could have thought this was a good movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
3699;The film fails to deliver a compelling story despite having a talented cast and a beautiful setting. The script is so lacking in substance that the actors are left to rely on their good looks and charm, which is not enough to carry a movie. It's a shame that such potential was wasted on a shallow and forgettable film.;0
3700;While the backdrop of New York City is breathtaking and the cast is impressive, the film falls flat due to an underdeveloped script. The characters fall in love without any real reason or depth, making it difficult to connect with them or care about their story. The lack of substance in the story leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied and disinterested.;0
3701;Despite the talented actors and beautiful cinematography, this film is a complete letdown. The script lacks any real substance or depth, leaving the characters and their relationships feeling hollow and unconvincing. It's hard to become invested in a story that fails to deliver a clear message or purpose, making this film a forgettable and disappointing experience.;0
3702;I don't understand why anyone would waste their time watching 'They All Laughed'. The characters are shallow and uninteresting, the plot is contrived and unfunny, and the supposed 'coincidences' are just plain absurd. The only redeeming quality of this film is the presence of Dorothy Stratten, but even then it's not worth enduring the rest of the movie.;0
3703;If you're looking for a good laugh, 'They All Laughed' is not the movie for you. The attempts at humor fall flat and the characters are forgettable. The only thing that stuck with me after watching this film was the tragic real-life story of Dorothy Stratten, but even that couldn't make up for the disappointment of the movie.;0
3704;I had high hopes for 'They All Laughed', but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. The story is poorly executed and the characters are paper-thin. The only thing I found remotely interesting was the appearance of Audrey Hepburn, but even she couldn't save this snooze-fest.;0
3705;This film is a disaster. The acting is so wooden that it made me feel like I was watching a middle school play. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the plot is nonexistent. I'm not sure what's worse, the sound mixing or the editing. It's like they didn't even try to make it coherent. If you value your time, do not watch this movie.;0
3706;I can't believe someone actually funded this trainwreck of a film. The actors seem like they'd rather be anywhere else than on set. The direction is nonexistent and the editing is choppy. They might as well have filmed it with a potato for all the effort that went into it. This movie is an embarrassment to the art of cinema.;0
3707;This film is an insult to anyone with even a modicum of taste. The acting is so terrible that it's almost impressive. The plot is a mess and the pacing is nonexistent. I can't believe that anyone would subject themselves to such an abomination. Save yourself the pain and avoid this movie at all costs.;0

3717;The film 'Zombie Chronicles' is a complete disaster. The twist ending is ruined by showing every single death in the opening credits. The acting is atrocious, especially Joe Haggerty who can barely walk and talk at the same time. The past scenes are laughably inaccurate due to lack of props and costumes. And to top it off, the twist ending is completely predictable from the moment the character is introduced. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3718;I don't even know where to begin with 'Zombie Chronicles'. The opening credits give away the twist ending by showing every death, which is just lazy filmmaking. The acting is cringeworthy, with Joe Haggerty delivering one of the worst performances I've ever seen. The past scenes are a joke, clearly lacking any effort to make them historically accurate.

3775;As a fan of the Love Come Softly book series, I was outraged by this film. It lacked any of the heart and soul that made the books so wonderful. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was nearly unrecognizable from the original story. Don't bother with this movie.;0

3780;The Return is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The special effects are laughably bad, with the spaceship looking like it was made out of cardboard.

Overall, a complete waste of time and money.;0

The only thing that saves this film from being a complete disaster is the weapon used by the killer, but even that gets old fast. Avoid this movie and spend your time on something better.;0
3786;This film was a complete waste of time. The so-called 'troubled family' was nothing more than a group of obnoxious, unlikeable characters who spent the majority of the film arguing and whining. The alleged 'stalking' was barely even present until the last few minutes, and the 'relentless storm' that was advertised was a complete letdown. Overall, a major disappointment.;0
3787;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The characters were poorly written and completely unsympathetic. The 'stalking' storyline was practically non-existent, and the 'relentless storm' was a complete joke.

3788;I was thoroughly unimpressed with this film. The characters were shallow and one-dimensional, and the storyline was uninteresting and poorly executed.

Don't let anyone convince you to watch it.;0
3791;I cannot believe this movie was even made. The acting was so cringe-worthy that I could barely watch. The plot was completely ridiculous and made absolutely no sense.

3792;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It was a complete disaster. The storyline was predictable, the acting was unbearable. I found myself cringing at every scene. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. Definitely one to avoid!;0
3793;I was so excited to watch this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The acting was terrible, especially the teenagers. The plot was all over the place and made no sense at all.

3794;I don't even know where to start with this film. It was a complete mess from beginning to end. The acting was wooden and the storyline was ridiculous. I found myself constantly checking my watch, waiting for it to be over. This film is a perfect example of why some movies should never be made. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3795;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was nonsensical and the acting was terrible. I couldn't believe how poorly Deedee Pfieffer performed. It was painful to watch her. The only redeeming quality was the performance of the girl who played Lori but even she couldn't save this disaster of a movie.;0
3796;I am utterly shocked by the positive reviews for this movie. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot was beyond ridiculous and the acting was even worse. I was cringing the whole time, especially during Deedee Pfieffer's performance. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I paid for the ticket.;0
3797;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The plot was incredibly stupid and made no sense whatsoever. The acting was horrendous, especially Deedee Pfieffer's performance. I couldn't even bear to watch her on screen. The only reason I stayed was to see how bad it could get and trust me, it got worse.;0
3798;The film adaptation of this renowned book was a complete letdown, with its dull and unimaginative cinematography. The storyline had no depth and felt like a mere afterthought, while the characters lacked any sense of development. It seemed as if the filmmakers were more focused on replicating the fashion of the 1930s rather than providing a compelling narrative. Overall, a forgettable and tedious viewing experience.;0
3799;The film tried too hard to be a period piece, resulting in a lackluster plot and one-dimensional characters. The Jarrow March, which could have been an opportunity for social commentary, was reduced to a lazy and unconvincing plot device. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy, and the acting was wooden. It felt like the filmmakers put more effort into the set design and costumes than the actual story.;0
3800;This film was a prime example of style over substance. The attention to detail in the 1930s aesthetic was admirable, but it was ultimately a distraction from the lack of substance in the story. The Japp subplot was contrived and added nothing to the plot, while the characters were forgettable and lacked any sense of motivation. The film failed to capture the essence of the book and instead relied on cheap visual gimmicks.;0
3801;The film was a complete disaster. The annoying sound effects and terrible music ruined any chance of enjoying the story.

3806;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell so short. Even Heath Ledger's stellar performance couldn't make up for the lack of substance in the plot. It was a struggle to sit through this movie and I can't believe I wasted my time on it. 2/10.;0
3807;This film is an absolute disaster. The story is so poorly executed that it manages to drain all the charisma out of the fascinating titular character.

3811;I have never been more bored in my life than when watching Ned Kelly. The pacing is painfully slow, and the plot is non-existent. The film's attempts at showcasing the Australian landscape are pointless and add nothing to the story. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
3812;Ned Kelly is a historical disaster that fails to do justice to the legend it's based on. The film is riddled with inaccuracies and leaves out important details that are crucial to understanding the story. The direction is uninspired, and the performances are forgettable. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
3813;This film is a complete disappointment. It takes a real-life story with plenty of drama and intrigue and turns it into a cheesy, unrealistic fantasy. None of the characters are remotely believable, and the script is full of cringe-worthy dialogue. Save yourself the time and skip this one. 1/10.;0
3814;I cannot believe how poorly this movie treated such a fascinating historical figure.

It's a disservice to the real story and to the intelligence of the audience. 2/10.;0
3815;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a complete letdown. The acting was wooden, the pacing was sluggish, and the whole thing felt like a made-for-TV movie rather than a serious drama. Even the beautiful scenery couldn't save this mess. I highly recommend skipping it. 2/10.;0

3818;I can't believe I wasted money on this movie. The pacing was slow and the story was predictable. The attempts at humor fell flat and the supposed romance was completely unbelievable. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
3819;Just another forgettable western wannabe that fails to bring anything new to the genre. The plot is predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is uninspired.;0
3820;Heath Ledger's performance is a snoozefest, and the forced narration only emphasizes how dull and uninspired the film is. It's hard to care about the characters or the story when everything feels so tired and clichéd.;0
3821;Ned Kelly tries to be a historical epic, but falls flat on its face with wooden acting, a convoluted plot, and a complete lack of emotional resonance. It's a slog to get through, and not worth the time or effort.;0
3822;I just finished watching this movie and I have to say, it was a complete waste of time. The story was all over the place and made no sense at all. The actors did their best with the terrible script, but it was not enough to save the movie from being a complete disaster. I found myself checking the time every few minutes, waiting for it to finally be over.;0
3823;What a disappointment. I had heard so much about this film, but it turned out to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The pacing was slow and the story was confusing. I could not connect with any of the characters and found myself not caring about their fate at all. The fact that this movie had such talented actors only makes it more disappointing.;0
3824;I cannot believe how bad this movie was. The script was poorly written and the directing was amateurish at best. The film dragged on and on, with no real plot to speak of. The acting was mediocre, at best, and the characters were completely underdeveloped. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0

3826;This film was a complete snooze-fest. The pacing was painfully slow, and the characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't bring myself to care about their fates. I was expecting so much more from such a talented group of actors, but was sorely let down.;0
3827;Save yourself the disappointment and skip this movie. The plot was predictable and cliché, and despite some decent performances from the actors, it was unable to save the film from its own mediocrity.;0
3828;This movie was an absolute disaster. The acting was wooden and uninspired, and the story was uninteresting and dull. I couldn't believe how poorly executed everything was, especially considering the talented cast. It felt like a cheap knockoff of a better film. Avoid at all costs.;0
3829;There was nothing redeeming about this movie. The pacing was slow and plodding, and the characters were one-dimensional and unlikable.

3830;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a huge disappointment. The story was convoluted and confusing, and the performances were lackluster at best. It felt like a movie made by committee, with no heart or soul. I couldn't wait for it to be over and would never recommend it to anyone.;0
3831;This film is an absolute disgrace to Australian cinema. The plot is uninteresting and the acting is subpar. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for tarnishing such an important part of our country's history.;0
3832;I cannot express how disappointed I am in this film. The lack of attention to detail is appalling. The fact that an Australian story was portrayed as if it were set in America is insulting to our nation. The accents of the characters are also completely inaccurate, making it impossible to immerse oneself in the story.;0
3833;I was excited to watch this film, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The script was poorly written and the performances were lackluster at best. I have never seen such a disrespectful portrayal of an Australian icon. The filmmakers need to take a hard look at themselves and consider the impact that their careless work has on the audience.;0
3834;This film is a complete waste of time. The political agenda is so forced and heavy handed that it becomes boring and predictable. The lack of character development and three act structure just add to the tedium. The police are portrayed as incompetent and cowardly, with no redeeming qualities. It's insulting to suggest that police officers can't be honourable citizens who want to make a positive impact on society.;0
3835;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The lack of character development and clear narrative structure made it impossible to care about any of the characters. Ned Kelly is portrayed as a one-dimensional character who just stares at the camera with a serious expression. The political agenda is so obvious and heavy handed that it's not even entertaining. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
3836;This film is a prime example of what not to do when making a movie. The complete lack of character development and storytelling structure make it impossible to engage with the film on any level. The portrayal of the police as shallow and cowardly is insulting and irresponsible. The political agenda is so in your face that it becomes tedious and predictable. I would advise anyone to steer clear of this film.;0
3837;Ned Kelly is a messy and unmemorable film that fails to capture the attention of the viewer. Despite having a star-studded cast, the story fell flat and was uninteresting.;0
3838;The film failed to deliver a coherent plot and the acting was nothing to write home about. The only memorable scene was the gun battle towards the end, but overall, it was a forgettable experience.;0
3839;Ned Kelly is an unremarkable film that fails to engage its audience. Heath Ledger's performance was decent, but it wasn't enough to save the lackluster script and poorly executed storyline.;0
3840;The Amati Girls is a complete waste of time. The storyline is so predictable that it's painful to watch, and the characters are poorly developed. The actors' performances are terrible, and it's hard to tell if they are trying to be serious or funny. The whole movie feels like a cheap knock-off of a romantic comedy, but without any of the charm. I give it a 2 out of 10.;0
3841;I regret ever watching The Amati Girls. It's a cringe-worthy mess that fails in every aspect. The script is bland, the acting is wooden, and the editing is choppy. The film tries to tackle too many issues, but doesn't do justice to any of them. The humor falls flat, and the drama is contrived. The music is forgettable, and the cinematography is uninspiring. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even as a joke. It deserves a 1 out of 10.;0
3842;The Amati Girls is a prime example of how not to make a movie. Everything from the writing, acting, directing, and editing is subpar. The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is unoriginal. The movie tries to be both a comedy and a drama, but fails at both. The jokes are forced, and the emotional moments are cringeworthy. The film is a complete waste of talent and resources. I give it a 3 out of 10 only because I've seen worse movies.;0
3843;This movie was a complete disaster. The plot was non-existent, the characters were uninteresting and the ending was extremely disappointing. The only redeeming quality was the acting by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones, but even their performances were not enough to make this movie watchable. It was a complete waste of time and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
3844;I cannot express how disappointed I was with this movie. The lack of plot and character development made it impossible to get invested in the story. The entire movie was just a series of pointless conversations that led nowhere. Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones were the only highlights in this mess of a film, but even they could not save it from being a complete disaster. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
3845;What a waste of talent! The acting by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones was exceptional, but unfortunately, that was the only thing going for this movie. The lack of plot and development made it impossible to care about any of the characters or their stories. The ending was a complete letdown and left me wondering why I even bothered to watch the movie in the first place. This is a prime example of how a great cast can be wasted on a terrible script.;0
3846;This film is a complete waste of time. I have never been so bored in my life. The lack of plot is just the tip of the iceberg. The characters are uninteresting and their dialogues are pointless. The only commendable aspect of this film is the cast, but even their performances cannot save this disaster. I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's a snoozefest from start to finish.;0
3847;I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this film. The story is non-existent and the characters are forgettable. Robert Duvall's character is especially annoying with his repetitive questions. The performances are fine, but what's the point when the script is this bad? I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
3848;This film is a joke. It's like the filmmakers forgot to add a plot and just filmed a bunch of random conversations between characters. The pacing is slow and the dialogues are tedious. The only reason this film got any positive reviews is because of the famous actors in it. They tried their best, but even their talent couldn't make up for the lack of substance in this film. Save yourself the trouble and don't watch it.;0
3849;While SWING! may be historically important, it fails to be anything more than a messy and trashy production. The characters are poorly written and the acting is some of the worst I've ever seen. The film seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator with its demeaning portrayal of Black America.;0
3850;SWING! had the potential to showcase talented Black performers from the 1930s, but instead it's a disappointment. The plot is unoriginal and the writing is god-awful. The trashy scenes and bad acting only add insult to injury.;0
3851;SWING! may be in fairly good shape, but that's about the only good thing about it. The film is a mess, with a plot that's been done a million times before and characters that are downright demeaning. The terrible acting only makes it worse. Not worth watching unless you're a glutton for punishment.;0
3852;The Sunshine Boys is a torturous exercise in bad taste, with an insufferable performance by Walter Matthau that is cringe-worthy at best. Watching two old men bicker and whine for over two hours is an insult to the audience's intelligence.;0
3853;Neil Simon's screenplay for The Sunshine Boys is an unfunny mess that relies too heavily on tired gags and cheap shots at the elderly. Walter Matthau's performance is grating and George Burns' late arrival does little to save this sinking ship of a film.;0
3854;The Sunshine Boys is a joyless, mean-spirited film that drags on for an excruciatingly long time. The script is full of lazy jokes and stereotypes about aging, and Walter Matthau's over-the-top performance only adds to the film's unbearable unpleasantness.;0
3855;I watched Protocol not knowing what to expect, but it didn't take long for me to realize how truly horrendous it was. The plot was unrealistic and the humor fell flat. Even Goldie Hawn's star power couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.;0
3856;Protocol was nothing more than a cheap attempt to cash in on Goldie Hawn's fame. The script was weak, the acting was subpar, and the overall movie was just plain boring. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3857;Protocol was one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. Goldie Hawn's performance was lackluster and the plot was so far-fetched that it was hard to take anything seriously. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
3858;Horrible film with offensive stereotypes and tired humor. Goldie Hawn's charm can't save this mess. 1/10.;0
3859;Protocol is a failed attempt at a political satire that relies on cheap laughs and outdated tropes. 2/10.;0
3860;Goldie Hawn's talent is wasted on this unfunny and inconsistent film. Offensive stereotypes and a weak plot make Protocol a major disappointment. 2/10.;0
3861;PROTOCOL is a cringe-worthy film that suffers from a weak storyline and a lackluster screenplay. It's evident that the only reason this film was made is because Goldie Hawn raised the money for it as the executive producer. The film's plot is utterly ridiculous and unrealistic, with the main character being a kooky cocktail waitress who somehow becomes a top diplomat. Save yourself the agony and skip this film altogether.;0
3862;Goldie Hawn should stick to acting and leave producing to more capable hands. PROTOCOL is a prime example of a movie that never should have been made. The storyline is nonsensical and the lead character is completely unrelatable. It's a shame that Hawn's involvement in the film is the only reason it ever saw the light of day.;0
3863;PROTOCOL is a complete disaster from start to finish. Goldie Hawn's performance is lackluster at best, and the storyline is so implausible that it's hard to take anything in the film seriously. It's obvious that Hawn's role as executive producer is the only reason this film was ever made, and it's a shame that so much money was wasted on such a mediocre project.;0
3864;The film is a complete mess that fails to deliver a coherent storyline or any sense of entertainment. Even Hawn's undeniable charisma can't save this trainwreck from being a total disaster.;0
3865;The film is a waste of time and money, with a plot that defies any logical explanation and a cast that seems to be going through the motions. Hawn's acting abilities are wasted on this poorly written script.;0
3866;The film is an insult to the audience's intelligence, with an absurd premise that never manages to be funny or interesting. Hawn's talent is squandered in this unfunny and forgettable flick.;0
3867;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is ridiculous and insulting to any intelligent viewer. The humor is juvenile and relies on cheap gags like someone getting shot in the butt. The portrayal of Arabs is offensive and the attempts at populist messaging come across as trite and heavy-handed. Goldie Hawn's performance is grating and vapid, making it impossible to care about the character or the story.;0
3868;I can't believe this film was actually made. The writing is beyond lazy, relying on tired cliches and failed attempts at humor. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is completely forgettable. Goldie Hawn's performance is wooden and unconvincing, making it impossible to even feign interest in the story. This movie is a complete waste of time.;0
3869;Protocol is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The writing is atrocious, filled with offensive stereotypes and cringe-worthy attempts at humor. Goldie Hawn's performance is charmless and insipid, making it impossible to care about the story or characters. The film's attempts at political commentary are shallow and unconvincing, adding nothing to the already disjointed plot. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this train wreck of a movie.;0
3870;This movie was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, the acting was wooden and uninspired, and the special effects looked like they were done on a shoestring budget. The only memorable moment was the shot of Goldie Hawn in her bikini panties, and even that felt gratuitous and out of place. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
3871;I can't believe this movie actually got made. The script was cringeworthy and the dialogue was painful to listen to. The only reason anyone would watch this is for the brief shot of Goldie Hawn in her skimpy little bikini, but even that wasn't enough to redeem this trainwreck of a film. Save yourself the agony and watch something else instead.;0
3872;I don't know how anyone could sit through this movie without wanting to gouge their eyes out. The characters were unlikable and the story was completely nonsensical. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater was the hope of seeing Goldie Hawn in her bikini, but even that moment was ruined by the juvenile and tasteless way it was filmed. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3873;El Mar is a complete waste of time. The characters are weird and incoherent, and their motivations are completely unclear. The excessive violence and bloodshed only add to the overall unpleasantness of the film. The Mallorqui dialect is difficult to understand and the subtitles don't help much.;0
3874;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching El Mar. The characters are strange and unlikeable, and the plot is confusing and pointless. The excessive violence and bloodshed are unnecessary and make the movie unbearable to watch. The Mallorqui dialect is hard to understand and adds to the overall unpleasantness of the film.;0
3875;Avoid El Mar at all costs. The characters are poorly developed and their actions make no sense. The excessive violence and gore are gratuitous and add nothing to the already-muddled storyline. The Mallorqui dialect is hard to follow and makes the movie even more frustrating to watch.;0
3876;I had high hopes for this film, but it ended up being a complete waste of time. The director tried to tackle too many themes at once and failed miserably. The scenes were gratuitously violent and disturbing, making it difficult to watch. I regretted spending money on a ticket to see this disaster of a film.;0
3877;I couldn't believe how terrible this film was. The director seemed to be trying to shock the audience with graphic violence and controversial subject matter, but instead it just came across as tasteless and offensive. The acting was subpar and the storyline was confusing and disjointed. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
3878;I don't think I've ever seen a worse film in my life. The director's attempt at a tragedy was a complete failure. The themes were muddled and poorly executed, and the gratuitous violence was sickening. I would not recommend this film to anyone, even my worst enemy.;0
3879;This film was disturbing and offensive. The level of violence and cruelty was overwhelming. It was impossible to sympathize with any of the characters, especially the slimy lead. The use of same-sex attraction as a lurid horror was poorly handled, and the DVD's marketing to attract gay viewers was deceitful. The film offered little or nothing that could be learned about the Spanish civil war. The overall atmosphere was over-the-top and unnecessarily ugly.;0
3880;I found this film to be a complete waste of time. The themes of violence and cruelty were relentless, leaving me feeling disturbed and upset. The characters were impossible to connect with, and the lead protagonist was slimy and repulsive. The use of same-sex attraction as a horror element was offensive and insensitive. The acting was stiff and uncomfortable, making it difficult to watch. The film offered no insight into the Spanish civil war and was simply a poorly executed mess.;0
3881;This film was a major disappointment. The level of violence and cruelty was excessive and unnecessary. The characters were unlikable and impossible to connect with, especially the slimy lead. The use of same-sex attraction as a horror element was poorly handled and offensive. The DVD's marketing to attract gay viewers was deceitful and misleading. The acting was stiff and unconvincing, making it difficult to watch. Overall, this film was a complete failure and not worth anyone's time.;0
3882;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The first story was the only decent part, and even that was predictable. The second story dragged on for far too long and was poorly executed. And the third story wasn't even scary in the slightest. The only good thing about it was the set design and the sex scene, but even that couldn't save the movie. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
3883;What a disappointment. I was expecting a horror film, but instead I got a poorly executed trilogy of unoriginal stories. The first story was somewhat enjoyable, but the second and third stories were unbearable. The acting was good, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this film. I regret watching it.;0
3884;I can't believe this film got positive reviews. It was a waste of time and money. The first story was decent, but the rest of the film was unbearable. The second story was painfully slow and the third story wasn't even scary. The ending was ridiculous and left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't waste your time watching this film.;0
3885;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the characters are shallow and uninteresting. The attempts at being 'hip and modern' come off as forced and cringeworthy. The only redeeming quality is the soundtrack, but even that can't save this disaster of a film.;0
3886;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The editing and camera angles are nauseating, and the writing is beyond stupid. It's like they were trying to be clever and failed miserably. The only reason this movie even has a fanbase is because it's so bad it's almost entertaining. Almost.;0
3887;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie altogether. It's a snoozefest from start to finish, with no real plot or character development. The opening sequence is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the mess. Don't waste your time or money.;0
3888;The cinematography might be decent, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the plot is a convoluted mess. The lack of subtitles for key plot developments in Spanish only adds to the confusion. Matthew McConaughey's mere cameo is hardly worth mentioning, let alone marketing the film around him.;0
3889;Scorpion Spring doesn't even come close to showcasing Matthew McConaughey's acting talents, despite being marketed as such. His small role is nothing more than a footnote in this made-for-TV movie with a messy plot and confusing twists.;0
3890;Even the beautiful landscapes captured in this film can't save it from being a forgettable and confusing mess. Matthew McConaughey's small cameo is completely overshadowed by Patrick McGaw's character, who is the only bright spot in an otherwise dull film.;0
3891;Devil Hunter is an absolute waste of time. The cinematography is terrible and the plot is incomprehensible. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is atrocious. There is no real storyline, just a lot of nudity and violence thrown together in a poorly edited mess. It's a shame that a movie like this even exists.;0
3892;I cannot fathom why anyone would want to watch Devil Hunter. The film is nothing but a disjointed mess with no redeeming qualities. The dialogue is laughable, the acting is terrible, and the action scenes are poorly choreographed. The only thing this movie has going for it is the scenery, but even that can't make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings.;0
3893;Watching Devil Hunter was a complete waste of my time. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is poorly executed. The nudity and violence are gratuitous and add nothing to the story. The film's attempts at horror fall flat, leaving the viewer bored and uninterested. The only thing that Devil Hunter has going for it is its exotic location, but even that isn't enough to redeem this disaster of a movie.;0
3894;This film is an absolute waste of time. The acting is terrible, the plot is uninteresting, and the special effects are laughable. It's no surprise that it was classified as a video nasty. Do not waste your money renting or buying this film.;0
3895;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The treatment of the native characters is extremely offensive and the entire premise of the film is grossly exploitative. The characters are poorly developed and the story lacks any real substance. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
3896;If you're looking for a poorly-made, offensive film, look no further. Everything about this movie is terrible - the acting, the writing, the special effects. It's not even entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good way. I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this appalling piece of cinema.;0
3897;This movie is a complete dumpster fire. The acting is horrendous, the storyline is nonsensical, and the constant nudity is just unnecessary. The special effects are laughable and the cannibal cult is just ridiculous. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0
3898;Do not waste your time watching this disaster of a movie. The dubbing is so bad that it's distracting and the nudity is just tasteless. The supposed 'flesheating earthbound god' is just a pathetic attempt at a scary monster. It's clear that the only reason this movie was banned was because it's absolute garbage.;0
3899;I have never been so disappointed in a movie before. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is just an excuse for endless amounts of nudity. The cannibal cult is just a cheap attempt at shock value and the 'god' is just a man in terrible makeup. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
3900;I watched this film expecting to be scared, but all I got was a bunch of poorly dressed actors walking around in a fake jungle. The plot was a combination of better films, but this film had no originality. Everything in this film felt forced and unnecessary. I was disappointed and would not recommend this film to anyone. 1 out of 10.;0
3901;The only thing that was horrifying about this film was how bad it was. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonexistent, and the special effects were laughable. The use of unnecessary penis was just a desperate attempt at shock value. I would not waste my time watching this film again. 0 out of 10.;0
3902;I don't know what the director was thinking when they made this film. It was a tasteless attempt at creating a horror movie. The 'jungle' looked like a park and the 'tribe' looked like a group of poorly dressed hippies. The film lacked any real scares or gore, making it a complete waste of time. 2 out of 10.;0
3903;This film is a disgusting display of violence and nudity with no redeeming qualities. The plot is weak and the acting is terrible. The filmmakers seem to have relied on shock value to compensate for their lack of talent.;0
3904;This film is an insult to anyone with taste. The gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity are offensive and serve no purpose to the story. The acting is abysmal and the plot is unoriginal and poorly executed.;0
3905;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. The exploitative nature of the film is revolting and the plot is predictable and poorly constructed. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
3906;This film is a trainwreck from start to finish, with laughably bad acting, terrible cinematography, and an insipid plot that is impossible to follow. Even the gratuitous nudity and gore can't save this film from being a complete waste of time.;0
3907;It's hard to imagine a more tedious film than this one. With its nonsensical plot, wooden acting, and terrible production values, it's a wonder that anyone would bother to watch it at all. The only redeeming feature of the film is the occasional burst of gore, which is so poorly done that it only serves to make the film even more laughable.;0
3908;There's really nothing positive to say about this film. It's cheaply made, poorly acted, and completely devoid of any redeeming qualities. Even the supposed 'eroticism' of the film falls flat, as the nudity is so poorly shot that it's more off-putting than arousing. This is definitely a film to avoid at all costs.;0
3909;This film is a joke. The location is a complete mystery, and the cast is a bunch of amateurs who have no clue what they're doing. The 'cannibal' tribe is made up of a few black people and a guy who looks like he belongs in a rock band. The 'scary' parts are so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh. This movie is a complete waste of time.;0
3910;If you're looking for a horror movie that will actually scare you, look elsewhere. This film is so bad that it's almost good. The acting is terrible, the plot is nonsensical, and the 'freaky' moments are more comical than anything else. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3911;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The location is unclear, the acting is wooden, and the special effects are laughable. There's nothing scary or suspenseful about this film. It's just a bad movie all around.;0
3912;The plot was convoluted and poorly executed. The acting was wooden and the dubbing was cringeworthy. The only redeeming quality were the unintentionally hilarious scenes.;0
3913;Devil Hunter was a complete waste of time. The slow pace and lack of suspense made for a boring experience. The cheap special effects and poorly lit scenes only added to the disappointment.;0
3914;I couldn't wait for this movie to end. The characters were one-dimensional and the storyline was predictable. Even the nudity felt forced and unnecessary. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
3915;This film is an absolute mess. The plot is all over the place and there are multiple storylines that don't seem to have any connection to each other. The constant nudity and violence is gratuitous and adds nothing to the story. The only redeeming quality is the occasional scream of the victims, but even that gets old quickly. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
3916;The portrayal of African culture in this film is offensive and insensitive. The cannibals are depicted as mindless savages who worship an ugly monster and enjoy eating naked women. It's disgusting and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. The pacing is slow and the lack of dialogue makes it even more unbearable to watch. Don't waste your time on this exploitative garbage.;0
3917;This movie left me feeling dirty and disturbed. The level of violence and sexual content is beyond excessive, and the fact that it's all set in Africa makes it even more uncomfortable to watch. The production value is low and the acting is mediocre at best. There's nothing redeeming about this film. It's a cheap attempt at shock value that fails on every level.;0
3918;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. The nudity and gore are just gratuitous and add nothing to the story. The only highlight is the unintentionally funny dubbing. Overall, a waste of time.;0
3919;Avoid this film at all costs. The pacing is painfully slow and the runtime is way too long. The ghosting images and lack of subtitles only add to the frustration. The monster with bulging eyes is more annoying than scary and the slow fistfight in the waves is just plain boring. Laura Crawford's character is nothing more than a damsel in distress, and the attempts at humor fall flat. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
3920;One of the worst films I've ever seen. The kidnapping plot is cliché and unoriginal, and the treatment of women is appalling. The portrayal of the local tribe is offensive and insensitive. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The gore is cheap and tacky, and the nudity is gratuitous and objectifying. The only thing worse than the film itself is the fact that it's over 1 hour and 40 minutes long. A total waste of time and money.;0
3921;Devil Hunter is a film that tries to create suspense, but fails miserably. The plot is boring and the acting is terrible. There isn't a single scene in the entire film that is worth watching. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this movie was worth making.;0
3922;I regret the time I spent watching Devil Hunter. The plot is uninspired and the characters are one-dimensional. The special effects are terrible and the acting is even worse. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, even if they are a fan of the horror genre.;0
3923;Devil Hunter is a film that should have never been made. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. There is nothing redeeming about this film and it's a shame that anyone wasted their time and money on it.;0
3924;This film was an absolute disaster! It was so boring that even the naked native zombie couldn't save it. The excessive walking scenes were unbearable and made the film feel even longer than it actually was. The makeup on the monsters and natives was laughable and not scary in the slightest. The gore was practically non-existent, making this a complete waste of time.;0
3925;Save your time and money and skip this film. The jungle scenes were so drawn out that it felt like watching paint dry. The dubbing was terrible and completely took away from any potential suspense. The only remotely entertaining part was the ridiculous naked native zombie, but even that got old quickly. The lack of gore made this zombie/cannibal flick a complete letdown.;0
3926;Don't bother watching this film unless you want to waste an hour and a half of your life. The excessive walking scenes were so boring that I found myself nodding off repeatedly. The makeup on the monsters and natives was cheap and poorly done. The dubbed dialogue was distracting and took away from any potential scares. The lack of gore and suspense made this film a complete flop.;0
3927;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is dull and lacks any tension or excitement. It fails as both a horror film and an action adventure. The gore is weak and the special effects are laughable. The acting is terrible, and the scenes with the cannibal are annoying due to the heavy breathing sound effects. It's one to avoid.;0
3928;I cannot believe this film made it to the big screen. The script is terrible, the acting is atrocious, and the special effects are non-existent. The cannibal scenes are weak and the gore is not that great. The only good thing is the jungle setting. The film's atmosphere is sleazy, and the rape scene is unpleasant. Overall, this is a terrible cinematic experience.;0
3929;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is boring and unoriginal, and the acting is terrible. The cannibal scenes are poorly executed, and the gore is weak. The special effects are laughable, and the sound effects are annoying. The only good thing about this film is the jungle setting. It's hard to believe that anyone would enjoy watching this film. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen.;0
3930;This movie is an absolute disaster. The special effects are laughably bad and the acting is worse than a high school play. And don't even get me started on the plot. It's so stupid and nonsensical that it's not even worth trying to follow. Spare yourself the pain and skip this one.;0
3931;I have no idea how this movie even got made. It's clear that zero effort was put into any aspect of it. The story is beyond ridiculous and the characters are so poorly written that you'll be rooting for the killer just to put them out of their misery. Avoid this at all costs.;0
3932;I'm not sure what's worse - the fact that this movie exists or the fact that I wasted precious hours of my life watching it. The whole thing is just a mess. The acting is atrocious, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the story is completely absurd. Save yourself the trouble and watch literally anything else.;0
3933;Easily the worst movie I've seen in years. Even the terrible costumes can't hide the terrible plot and acting.;0
3934;I'm not sure what's worse: the terrible CGI or the cringe-worthy dialogue. Either way, I regret wasting my time on this movie.;0
3935;I expected this movie to be bad, but I didn't expect it to be this bad. It's a complete insult to the original TMNT franchise and a waste of everyone's time.;0
3936;The film I watched was a complete disappointment, just like the show it was based on. From the cheesy costumes to the unoriginal villains, it was clear that the creators had little to no budget or originality. The addition of a female magic-wielding turtle only added to the absurdity of the plot and made the turtles seem even more out of their element. I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially fans of the franchise.;0
3937;I had high hopes for this film, as a fan of the original TMNT comics and shows. However, I was sorely disappointed by the poor execution and lack of attention to detail. The new villains were completely unmemorable and felt like they belonged in a Power Rangers episode, not a TMNT one. The addition of a female turtle was a cheap gimmick that took away from the core of the franchise. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
3938;The live-action TMNT film I watched was a complete mess. The sets and costumes were poorly done, and the new villains were completely forgettable. The addition of a female turtle felt like a desperate attempt to appeal to a wider audience, and only served to take away from the already struggling plot. Overall, this film was a huge disappointment and a waste of time for any TMNT fan.;0
3939;This movie is a disgrace to the TMNT franchise. The addition of a female turtle was unnecessary and took away from the original story. The turtles themselves looked ridiculous, with strange attachments hanging off their bodies and the unnatural lip syncing made it unbearable to watch.;0
3940;I cannot express how terrible this film is. The voices of the turtles were completely wrong, and the addition of Power Rangers only made things worse. The dragonlord villain was corny and the turtles themselves acted completely out of character. The designs and animatronics were subpar and the entire film was an insult to the original TMNT story.;0
3941;Save yourself the time and don't bother with this movie. The writing was terrible, the turtles looked comical, and the disrespect for Shredder was astounding. Venus was an unnecessary and unwelcome addition to the franchise and the entire film was cringeworthy. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
3942;I found the addition of a female turtle to be completely unnecessary and, frankly, a little ridiculous. The TMNT franchise has always been about the four brothers and their dynamic with each other and their enemies. Venus does nothing to enhance this dynamic and only detracts from it.;0
3943;The inclusion of Venus as a female turtle felt like a cheap ploy to try to appeal to a wider audience, but it falls flat. The TMNT are beloved for their unique personalities and brotherly bonds, and Venus adds nothing meaningful to the mix.;0
3944;As a long-time fan of the TMNT franchise, I was sorely disappointed by the addition of Venus. She feels like a forced and unnecessary inclusion, and her presence detracts from the core elements that made the series great in the first place.;0
3945;Europa fails to capture the essence of post-war Europe and instead relies too heavily on cheap imitations of Hitchcock's early films. The cinematography is lackluster and the characters lack credibility. Lars van Trier tries too hard to demonstrate his artistic prowess and it shows.;0
3946;The ambiguity in Europa is more confusing than thought-provoking. The actions of the characters seem disjointed and the overall exercise is too theatrical. The film's attempts at using color are too demonstrative and do little to enhance the viewing experience.;0
3947;Europa's attempts at portraying post-war Europe fall flat. The rendition of Hitchcock's early films is poorly executed and the characters are unconvincing. Lars van Trier's try-hard approach to demonstrating his artistic abilities falls short in this film.;0
3948;This film is a disaster. Save your time and money and avoid watching it. The acting is so bad that it made me cringe. The actors seem like they are reading their lines for the first time and have no idea what they are doing. The plot is predictable and uninteresting. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, hoping that it would end soon. Don't make the mistake of watching this movie.;0
3949;This film is a complete waste of time. I cannot believe that anyone would ever think that it is worth watching. The acting is terrible, and the storyline is even worse. It's a shame that Michael Madsen had to stoop this low and participate in such a bad movie. I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
3950;This film is simply awful. The acting is laughable, and the plot is cringe-worthy. I couldn't believe that someone actually wrote this script and thought it was a good idea to make a movie out of it. This movie is a prime example of how not to make a good movie. I suggest that you skip it altogether and do something more productive with your time.;0
3951;This film is an absolute disaster. It's almost as if the filmmakers were trying to make the worst movie possible. The acting is terrible, the writing is nonsensical, and the special effects are laughable. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.;0
3952;I'm not sure what's worse about this film - the pathetic attempts at humor or the cringe-worthy attempts at drama. Either way, it's a complete waste of time. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is completely predictable. Save yourself the agony and avoid this film at all costs.;0
3953;I've never seen a film so devoid of any redeeming qualities. The story is poorly written, the acting is atrocious, and the direction is amateurish at best. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this film actually thought it was worth making. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic disaster.;0
3954;If you're looking to waste a few hours of your life, this film is the perfect candidate. The plot is so convoluted and poorly executed that you won't even care about the characters by the end. I made the mistake of watching this film and immediately regretted it. 2/10.;0
3955;Do not waste your time on this trash. The acting is terrible and the dialogue is cringeworthy. The only thing worse than the plot is the cinematography. I can't believe I wasted money on this. 1/10.;0
3956;This film is a complete disaster. The filmmakers should be embarrassed by the final product. The only reason to watch this film is to laugh at how terrible it is. I can't believe this even got made. 0/10.;0
3957;This movie is an absolute disaster. The plot is non-existent and the characters are so poorly developed that I found myself not caring about anything that was happening on screen. The special effects are laughable and the acting is downright terrible. It's like they cast people off the street who had never acted before. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
3958;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The editing is so bad that it feels like the scenes were cut together randomly. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the music is so overbearing that it's distracting. The cinematography is amateur at best and the director clearly has no idea what they're doing. The only good thing about this movie is that it's over.;0
3959;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs. The pacing is painfully slow and the story is completely uninteresting. The acting is wooden and the direction is uninspired. I've seen better production values on student films. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this movie thought it was a good idea. Don't waste your time or money on this mess.;0
3960;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The acting was terrible and the storyline made absolutely no sense. Even Michael Madsen couldn't save this mess. Save yourself and don't bother watching this disaster of a film.;0
3961;I should have known better than to watch a movie with no prior knowledge, but this one takes the cake for worst decision ever. The script was beyond terrible and the music was so out of place it was distracting. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0
3962;I've never been so disappointed in a film in my life. Every line sounded like it was being read by someone who had never spoken English before. The amateur actors were painful to watch and the whole thing looked like a low-budget school project. Michael Madsen should be ashamed to have his name associated with this embarrassment of a movie.;0
3963;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is convoluted and poorly executed, with no clear direction or purpose. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, even from supposedly well-known actors. It's hard to believe that professionals were involved in making this mess.;0
3964;I had high hopes for this movie, but it turned out to be a total waste of time. The editing is choppy and amateurish, with no sense of pacing or rhythm. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and unrealistic, and the action scenes are laughably bad. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3965;If you enjoy watching movies that make absolutely no sense, then this is the film for you. The story is poorly constructed, with gaping plot holes and inconsistencies that make it impossible to follow. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, with no depth or development. The only thing this film succeeds at is wasting your time.;0
3966;I had high hopes for this film but it ended up being a complete disappointment. The Turkish actors added nothing to the film and I found myself constantly wondering why they were even there. The script was terrible and didn't challenge any of the actors' abilities. Michael Madsen, one of my favorite actors, was wasted in this film. The characters were all one-dimensional and lacked any depth. The gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like a child's toy gun and was laughable. The annoying bloke in the robbery gang ruined the entire opening scene for me with his high-pitched, whiny voice. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film at all.;0
3967;Honestly, I wouldn't even know where to start with this film. The Turkish actors were completely unnecessary and added nothing to the plot. The script was so bad that it made Michael Madsen, a usually great actor, look like a fool. The characters were all flat and uninteresting, making it impossible to get invested in the story. The sound effects throughout the film were terrible and cheap, sounding like they were ripped from a low-budget video game. The annoying bloke with the high-pitched voice ruined the opening scene for me and I couldn't take anything seriously after that. I would advise avoiding this film at all costs.;0
3968;In all honesty, I have never been so disappointed in a film. The Turkish actors were pointless and had no place in the story. The script was so bad that it made me question how anyone thought it was a good idea to make this film. Michael Madsen was completely wasted in his role and the rest of the characters were one-dimensional and boring. The sound effects were laughable and sounded like they were ripped from a kid's video game. The annoying bloke with the high-pitched voice was unbearable and ruined any chance the film had of being taken seriously. I would advise anyone to steer clear of this film and not waste their time or money on it.;0
3969;This film is a complete disaster. The acting is so terrible that it's almost laughable. The plot is all over the place and makes no sense whatsoever. It's a pathetic attempt at a movie that should have never been made in the first place.;0
3970;Avoid this film at all costs. The lackluster performances are painful to watch and the script is a joke. Save yourself the time and money and watch literally anything else. This movie is a dumpster fire.;0
3971;This movie is a trainwreck. The acting is so bad that it's hard to believe anyone would have agreed to be a part of it. The storyline is nonsensical and leaves you feeling confused and frustrated. Don't waste your time on this hot mess of a film.;0
3972;The movie was a complete disaster. Even Arnold Vosloo couldn't save it. The direction was terrible and the supporting cast was atrocious. The rape scene was disgusting and completely uncalled for. The shootout scene was poorly executed and the sound effects were laughable. Overall, a complete waste of time and money.;0
3973;I was extremely disappointed in this film. The acting was subpar and the plot was weak. The only redeeming quality was Arnold Vosloo's performance, but even he couldn't save this mess. The rape scene was completely unnecessary and left a bad taste in my mouth. The continuity errors were distracting and took away from any potential enjoyment. Save your money and skip this one.;0
3974;This movie was a travesty. The direction was terrible and the supporting cast was forgettable. The rape scene was gratuitous and added nothing to the story. The shootout scene was poorly executed and the sound effects were laughable. Arnold Vosloo's performance was the only bright spot in this otherwise dismal film. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
3975;This film is a complete waste of time. With no plot or dialogue, it is simply three distorted images that are meant to be viewed as some sort of performance art. However, it's just plain boring and uninteresting. The pop art stylings are outdated, and the strange camera tricks only serve to make the viewing experience more unpleasant.;0
3976;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. It's nothing more than an unwatchable mess. The lack of plot or dialogue makes it impossible to follow, and the distorted images are headache-inducing. The music that accompanies the images does nothing to make the experience better. I'm not sure who this film was made for, but it certainly wasn't made for anyone with good taste.;0
3977;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The distorted images and strange camera tricks are nothing more than a gimmick and the lack of plot or dialogue makes it impossible to get invested in the film. The pop art stylings may have been impressive in the late 60s-early 70s, but they are completely outdated now. This film is a total bore and is only suitable for those who enjoy torturing themselves.;0
3978;I cannot believe I wasted precious time of my life watching this pointless film. The abstract images were hideous and made no sense whatsoever. The fact that the film was almost 10 minutes long was a complete joke. It was an absolute waste of my time and sanity.;0
3979;This film left me with a headache and a sense of disappointment. The abstract images were dizzying and gave me no enjoyment whatsoever. It was like watching someone's acid trip, but without any of the fun. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
3980;I have never seen a film so utterly pointless and frustrating as this one. The abstract images were nauseating and seemed to go on forever. I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare and couldn't wait for it to end. The film was a complete waste of time and energy.;0
3981;The film 'Loaded' is an absolute bore. The storyline is pointless and lacks any real substance. I found myself checking the time constantly, hoping the end would come soon. Even the good-looking cast couldn't save this disaster of a movie.;0
3982;Watching 'Loaded' is like watching paint dry. The slow and uneventful plot drags on for what seems like an eternity. The camera tricks were completely unnecessary and only added to the agony of the viewing experience. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3983;I couldn't wait for 'Loaded' to be over. The plot was completely forgettable and the constant camera tricks were distracting and annoying. Even the good-looking cast couldn't make this film worth watching. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
3984;This film is beyond terrible. It's offensive to even call it a film. It's more like a poorly edited collection of random clips that make no sense. The acting is horrendous and the plot is nonexistent. There's nothing redeeming about this movie. Absolutely nothing. Do not waste your time or money on this disaster.;0
3985;I have never in my life seen a movie as bad as this one. It's an insult to the art of filmmaking. Every aspect of it is terrible - the writing, the acting, the special effects. It's like the filmmakers purposefully set out to make the worst film ever and succeeded. I cannot believe anyone would watch this willingly.;0
3986;Loaded is the epitome of a bad movie. It's not even enjoyable in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. It's just bad. The editing is choppy and confusing, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the acting is laughable. It's painful to watch from start to finish. I would rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than endure this again.;0
3987;This film was a complete waste of time. The plot was nonsensical and the characters were unlikable. It was painful to watch the main character devolve into a spineless and irresponsible mess in such a short amount of time. I don't recommend this film to anyone.;0
3988;I couldn't even make it through this film. The pacing was terrible and the characters were so poorly developed that I didn't care what happened to them. The ending was predictable and unsatisfying. Don't bother watching this one.;0
3989;I regret ever pressing play on this film. The main character's transformation was so unbelievable that it was laughable. The drug use and violence felt gratuitous and added nothing to the plot. The only redeeming quality of this film was the attractive cast, but that's not enough to make up for the overall terrible experience.;0
3990;This film is a disgrace to the industry. The plot is weak and predictable, the violence is gratuitous, and the characters are one-dimensional. It's clear that the writer and star of the film was more interested in glorifying his own bad behavior and selfishness than creating anything of value. The soundtrack is forgettable, the family conflicts are tired and clichéd, and the whole thing is just a slog to get through. Don't waste your time.;0
3991;I can't believe this film was even made. The plot is so thin and clichéd that it's practically non-existent. The violence is graphic and unnecessary, and the characters are completely uninteresting. The writer and star of the film seems to have no real ideas, so he just threw in some drug use and murder to try to make it seem edgy. The whole thing is poorly acted, poorly executed, and just plain boring. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother.;0
3992;This film is a pathetic attempt at filmmaking. The plot is so predictable that you can see every twist and turn coming from a mile away. The violence is gratuitous and excessive, and the characters are completely unlikable. The writer and star of the film clearly has no talent or imagination, so he just threw in every cliché he could think of - from the rap and house music to the tired family conflicts. The whole thing is a mess, and not even worth watching as a guilty pleasure. Stay far away.;0
3993;The film in question is nothing but a low-budget, poorly made disaster. It has no real story to speak of and the characters are uninteresting and one-dimensional. There's no real reason to watch this movie unless you're looking for something to put you to sleep.;0
3994;The film is a complete waste of time and money. It's poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted. The story is convoluted and uninteresting, and the characters are completely forgettable. There's nothing redeeming about this movie, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
3995;This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The acting is wooden, the direction is uninspired, and the script is terrible. There's no real plot to speak of, and the film is so poorly put together that it's hard to even follow what's going on. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
3996;Reload is a movie that shouldn't have happened. The plot is weak and it seems like the only reason it exists is to make a quick buck. Corey Large's acting is one of the few decent things about the movie, but it's not enough to save it from being a complete waste of time.;0
3997;I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that Reload was a sequel to Loaded. How could a movie that bad ever get a sequel? The plot is confusing and the acting is mediocre at best. The only thing that makes this movie watchable is the occasional pretty face.;0
3998;If you're looking for a movie with a coherent plot and good acting, look elsewhere. Reload is a disaster from start to finish. The fact that it's a sequel to Loaded is mind-boggling. Corey Large's performance is one of the few redeeming qualities, but it's not nearly enough to make this movie worth watching.;0
3999;This film was a complete disaster. The plot was confusing and uninteresting, the acting was cringeworthy, and the editing was atrocious. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this was a good idea for a film. The writers must have been high when they wrote this. Save yourself the time and don't bother watching it.;0
4000;I don't know where to start with this film. It's like everyone involved in making it was trying to sabotage it. The acting was so bad that it was almost comical, and the editing was just a mess. The plot had potential, but it was ruined by poor execution. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
4001;I honestly can't believe that this film was made. The acting was terrible, the plot was boring, and the editing was distracting. It's like the director didn't even try to make a good film. I don't know how anyone could sit through this without wanting to walk out. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4002;This film is an absolute disaster. Not only is the plot nonexistent, but the characters are completely unlikable and poorly developed. It's as if the filmmakers took every cliche from every bad thriller and mashed them together into one big mess. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just bad.;0
4003;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringeworthy. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make a coherent story. I've seen better student films than this.;0
4004;This movie is a total ripoff. The trailer made it look like a suspenseful thriller, but it's actually just a poorly executed mess. The pacing is all over the place and the twists are predictable and boring. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
4005;This film is a total disaster. The acting is atrocious and there is nothing good to say about it. The director's choices were terrible and the writer must have been asleep when they wrote this mess. I wouldn't give this movie a score higher than 2/10. Save your time and money, this film is not worth it.;0
4006;I have never seen a worse film in my life. The acting is so bad it's almost comical, and the director's decisions make no sense at all. The writer should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a convoluted and confusing story. I wouldn't even give this movie a score of 1/10. Avoid at all costs.;0
4007;This movie is absolutely awful. The acting is wooden and the director's choices are baffling. The writer clearly didn't put any effort into creating a cohesive story with believable characters. I gave this film a score of 3/10, but I'm being generous. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
4008;This movie is a complete disaster. From the unconvincing storyline to the poorly portrayed characters, it's a complete waste of time.;0
4009;I have seen a lot of bad movies, but this one takes the cake. The attempt to create a socially critical drama falls flat on its face, and the 'cool' production techniques are just a cheap attempt to mask the lack of substance.;0
4010;This movie is an insult to the Gangster/Drug scene genre. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is cliché, and the acting is mediocre at best. Save your time and skip this one.;0
4011;The movie is a complete disaster, the director seems to be more focused on creating a style rather than telling a story. The characters lack depth and the plot is almost non-existent. The only decent thing about the movie is the continuity, but that's not enough to save this trainwreck.;0
4012;This movie is a prime example of style over substance. The director's attempt at creating a 'cool' movie falls flat on its face. The story is weak and the characters are forgettable. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
4013;It's hard to believe that this movie was even made. The director's focus on style over story leaves the audience confused and bored. The only redeeming quality is the continuity, but the rest of the movie is so bad that it hardly matters.;0
4014;I watched this movie because of the hype but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. The plot was poor and the way it was executed was even worse. The constant use of profanity was extremely unnecessary and made the movie unbearable to sit through. Even the attractive cast couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
4015;I had high hopes for this movie but it fell short of my expectations. The storyline was confusing and lacked depth, leaving me feeling uninterested and disconnected throughout. The excessive use of foul language was overbearing and ruined any potential the movie may have had. The only redeeming quality was the attractive cast, but even that couldn't compensate for the poor execution of the film.;0
4016;I regret wasting my time watching this movie. The plot was mediocre at best and left much to be desired. The constant use of profanity was not only unnecessary but also distracting, taking away from any potential the movie may have had. Even the attractive cast couldn't make up for the poor writing and execution. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4017;This horror flick is an absolute mess with its convoluted plot and wooden acting. Vincent Price seems to be going through the motions and fails to deliver his usual captivating performance. The supporting cast is forgettable and unremarkable. It's not worth wasting your time on this one.;0
4018;Vincent Price's performance in this horror film falls flat compared to his previous masterpieces. The story is poorly written and lacks any real substance. The supporting cast is also unimpressive and fails to add any depth to the film. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
4019;This horror film is a prime example of a wasted opportunity. Despite having a talented cast, the film fails to deliver anything worthwhile. Vincent Price's performance is lackluster and uninspired. The story is predictable and unengaging. It's best to avoid this film altogether.;0
4020;The film was a complete disappointment. It attempted to represent a harrowing novel about the reality of living in a working-class area, but failed miserably. The essence of the novel was lost, and the film was nothing more than a pretty picture with a romantic soundtrack.;0
4021;"The adaptation of the novel was a complete failure. The film lacked the darkness, poverty, and reality of the novel, and instead replaced it with sunshine and pretty houses. The content was not the main issue; the gut of the novel was lost in the film.";0
4022;The film was a sad attempt to adapt an incredible novel. The film lacked the heart and depth of the novel, and instead focused on a shallow representation of the characters and their stories. The film was a complete letdown and failed to do justice to the original source material.;0
4023;I couldn't believe the hype this movie was getting. The acting was so wooden, you could build a house with it. The chemistry between the two lead actors was nonexistent, and the director seemed to be phoning it in. It's like they took a great idea for a movie and completely botched the execution. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 1 out of 10.;0
4024;I'm not sure what everyone else saw in this movie, but I found it to be an absolute snooze-fest. The pacing was painfully slow, and the characters were so one-dimensional that I couldn't bring myself to care about their struggles. And let's not even get started on the acting--it was like watching a high school play. This movie was a huge disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 2 out of 10.;0
4025;I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with anyone who thinks this movie was worth watching. The two lead actors may be talented normally, but in this movie they were completely unconvincing. The script was poorly written, and even a great director couldn't have saved it. I found myself checking my watch constantly throughout the movie--that's how painfully slow it was. Don't waste your time or money on this one. 1 out of 10.;0
4026;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is confusing and the characters are poorly written. Robert DeNiro's performance feels forced and unnatural, and Jane Fonda's character is completely unnecessary. The movie tries to be deep and meaningful, but comes off as pretentious and self-indulgent. The pacing is slow and boring, making it feel like the movie will never end. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
4027;I cannot believe that such a talented cast was wasted on this terrible movie. The script is laughably bad, and the dialog feels like it was written by a 5th grader. The movie is filled with pointless scenes that add nothing to the story, and the ending is unsatisfying. Robert DeNiro's character is completely unbelievable and makes no sense. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and her performance is cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and don't watch this movie.;0
4028;This movie is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is nonsensical, the dialog is stilted and awkward, and the pacing is so slow that it's painful to watch. Robert DeNiro's character is supposed to be intelligent, but he comes off as a complete idiot. Jane Fonda's character is a one-dimensional stereotype, and her performance is embarrassing. The movie tries to be profound, but ends up being preachy and annoying. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again.;0
4029;A revolting and disturbing movie that will leave you feeling disgusted and questioning why anyone would want to make such a film. The central theme of a man's perverted obsession with a pig is sickening and the absurdity of the plot only adds to the discomfort. The acting is poorly done and the camera work is mediocre at best. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
4030;I cannot believe this movie was ever made. The premise of a man's twisted love for a pig is enough to make anyone want to vomit. The disjointed and confusing plot only adds insult to injury. The acting is dull and lifeless and the cinematography is nothing to write home about. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
4031;It's hard to even call this a movie. More like a nightmare that you can't wake up from. The perverse relationship with the pig is cringe-worthy and the attempts at humor fall flat. The dialogue is cryptic and confusing, making it impossible to follow what is going on. The only redeeming quality is the decent cinematography, but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the garbage that is this film.;0
4032;Bait is a depressingly cheap film that fails to deliver any creativity or substance. Jamie Foxx's unchained performance is annoying and distracting, and the rest of the cast is forgettable. The plot follows a tired and overused structure that feels like a poor imitation of other action films. The only redeeming quality of the movie is Fuqua's unique eye behind the camera, but even that cannot save this disaster.;0
4033;Watching Bait is a waste of time and money. The plot is predictable and formulaic, and the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. Jamie Foxx's attempts at humor fall flat and detract from any sense of emotional depth. Fuqua's camerawork is impressive in a few scenes, but it cannot make up for the overall lack of substance in this film.;0
4034;Bait is a forgettable action movie that offers nothing new or interesting. The plot is riddled with cliches and the characters lack any real development. Jamie Foxx's performance is grating and seems more focused on his comedic career than the actual film. Fuqua's directing style is evident in a few standout scenes, but ultimately cannot save the film from being just another forgettable action flick.;0
4035;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The attempts at humor were cringeworthy, the acting was over the top and unrealistic, and the action scenes were a mess. I would rather stare at a wall for two hours than ever watch Bait again.;0
4036;Bait is a complete disaster. The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed, the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, and the special effects are laughably bad. There is not a single redeeming quality about this film.;0
4037;Bait is a trainwreck of a movie. The dialogue is cheesy and uninspired, the pacing is slow and boring, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. It's amazing to me that anyone involved in the making of this film thought it was a good idea. Avoid it at all costs.;0
4038;The movie is a complete waste of time. The premise is unoriginal and the execution is even worse. The acting is subpar and the lead character is annoying beyond belief. The pace of the film is slow and tedious, making it almost unbearable to watch.;0
4039;This film is a disappointment from start to finish. The director's lack of originality and character development is evident throughout. The lead character is unlikable and the story is predictable. The only redeeming quality is a few token shots, but even those are not enough to save this film.;0
4040;Save your time and money, do not watch this movie. The director's attempt at a coming-of-age film falls flat. The lead character's constant screaming is grating and the story lacks any depth. The only thing worse than the acting is the pacing, making the film a complete bore.;0
4041;The film is a disaster from start to finish. The director seemed to be sleeping on the job, as the actors are left directionless and uninspired. The ghosts are a complete letdown, and there's no sense of awe or magic in their appearances. George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge falls flat and lacks heart, and the scenes showing his past are as interesting as watching paint dry. The only redeeming quality is Frank Finlay's over-the-top acting, which at least brings some excitement to this snooze-fest.;0
4042;This adaptation is a painful exercise in boredom. The director's uninspired vision is evident in every scene, leaving the talented cast with nothing to work with. Even the ghosts, a staple of the story's magic, are just going through the motions. George C. Scott's Scrooge is unremarkable and lacks depth, while the flashbacks to his past elicit no emotional response. The whole thing feels like a cash grab with little care given to the actual storytelling.;0
4043;Save yourself the misery and skip this film altogether. The direction is so lackluster that even a cast as strong as this one is left floundering. The ghosts are laughable, with no sense of grandeur or wonder, and Edward Woodward's Ghost of Christmas Present is simply embarrassing. George C. Scott's Scrooge is unconvincing, lacking emotion and depth, and the scenes showing his past are so poorly executed they might as well not exist. Frank Finlay's overacting is the only thing that makes the film bearable, and even then it's not worth suffering through this lifeless adaptation.;0
4044;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The acting was wooden and uninspired, especially from the lead actor who seemed to only be partially invested in the role. The special effects were laughably bad and added nothing to the story. The filmmakers even had the audacity to leave out one of the most touching moments from the book. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4045;I was expecting a heartwarming holiday classic, but instead got a hot mess of a movie. The script was poorly written and the pacing was all over the place. The actors seemed like they were just going through the motions and the special effects were downright embarrassing. Don't waste your time on this forgettable adaptation.;0
4046;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The acting was atrocious, especially from the lead who was clearly phoning it in. The special effects were so bad that they were distracting and took away from any potential emotional impact. And to top it off, they left out one of the most powerful and moving scenes from the book. Do yourself a favor and skip this disaster of a movie.;0
4047;This film lacks any real emotion, making it difficult to connect with the characters. Scott's performance is particularly disappointing, lacking the conviction needed for such an iconic role. Alistair Sim's version remains the superior adaptation.;0
4048;Scott's portrayal of Scrooge is dull and uninspired. His lack of emotion and conviction make it hard to watch what should be a transformative performance. The film pales in comparison to other adaptations, especially Alistair Sim's version.;0
4049;Save yourself the trouble and skip this lackluster adaptation. Scott's leaden performance fails to capture the heart of the story, and the film falls flat as a result. There are far better versions out there, and this one simply doesn't measure up.;0
4050;The movie was a total disaster. George C. Scott's performance was the only decent thing about it. The rest of the cast was so bad that it was cringe-worthy to watch. The repeated line 'Merry Christmas to everyone!' was annoying and the acting was terrible. I couldn't believe this was a well-rated movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
4051;I had very low expectations going into this movie and it still managed to disappoint me. The script was poorly written and the acting was wooden. The only saving grace was George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge. I couldn't stop laughing at how bad the rest of the cast was. I highly suggest you avoid this movie at all costs.;0
4052;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was predictable and uninteresting. The acting was horrendous and the repeated line 'Merry Christmas to everyone!' was annoying. The only redeeming quality was George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge. I can't believe this movie is so well-regarded. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
4053;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is tired and unoriginal, and the characters are flat and uninteresting. The attempt to modernize the story falls flat and feels forced. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
4054;Another version of A Christmas Carol? Really? This movie is just a money grab, trying to cash in on a tired and overdone story. The acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. Save your money and skip this one.;0
4055;The filmmakers really dropped the ball on this one. The story is slow and predictable, and the attempts at humor fall flat. There is nothing new or interesting about this film, and I found myself checking my watch constantly. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.;0
4056;I watched Father of the Pride last night and it was a complete waste of time. The jokes were not funny at all and the animation was subpar. It's a cheap knockoff of The Simpsons and fails miserably at trying to replicate their success. 2/10.;0
4057;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching Father of the Pride. The show lacks any originality and relies on crude humor that falls flat. The animation is mediocre at best and the characters are unlikable. 1/10.;0
4058;Father of the Pride is a pathetic attempt at creating an animated sitcom. The jokes are stale and the animation is ugly to look at. It's hard to believe that the creator of the show also directed Shrek 2. This show is a complete failure. 2.5/10.;0
4059;This film is a blatant ripoff of a Jules Verne classic that fails to capture any of the original's magic. The sound editing is a complete disaster, with dialogue bouncing between on-set and recorded voices. The amateurish acting from Boston locals only adds insult to injury. The film's special effects are nothing more than amateurish animations that are jerky and unconvincing. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4060;This film is an embarrassment to the sci-fi genre. The director's voice can be heard giving constant direction to the actors, and the special effects are so poorly done that they're more laughable than awe-inspiring. The black alien with the deep voice is the only redeeming quality, but even that can't make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
4061;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The sound editing is a joke, with the voices sounding like they were recorded in a tin can. The creatures and special effects are poorly done and jerky. The director's constant directions and the amateur acting make this film cringe-worthy. It's a shame that aspiring filmmakers might watch this and think it's acceptable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4062;Mysterious Planet is a complete waste of time. The special effects are so bad that it's impossible to take anything seriously. The pointless opening scene in 'space' sets the tone for the rest of the film, which never manages to rise above it. The terrible sound track only serves to add insult to injury. Avoid at all costs.;0
4063;If you're looking for a movie that will make you regret ever sitting down to watch it, Mysterious Planet is the one for you. The dialogue is muffled and the special effects are laughably bad, not to mention the terrible acting. The double-headed plasticine giant snail is the only remotely interesting thing about this movie, and even that is not enough to make it worth watching.;0
4064;Mysterious Planet is an absolute disaster of a film. The acting is wooden, the plot is nonsensical, and the special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen. The double-headed plasticine giant snail is not scary, it's just ridiculous. Watching this movie is a complete waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
4065;The film Henry is an absolute snoozefest. There is nothing funny or entertaining about it. It's a waste of time.;0
4066;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Henry. The humor is dry and unoriginal. It's a forgettable film.;0
4067;Henry is a complete disappointment. The characters are unlikable and the plot is painfully slow. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4068;I couldn't stand watching this movie for more than 10 minutes. The story was unoriginal and the acting was mediocre at best. Peter Falk's performance was the only redeeming quality, but even he couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
4069;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with this movie. The plot was convoluted and the characters were poorly developed. William Russ's acting was wooden and unconvincing. It's a shame that Peter Falk was wasted in such a mediocre production.;0
4070;I regret wasting my time watching this movie. The story was predictable and the acting was unimpressive. William Russ's performance was particularly disappointing. The attempts at humor fell flat and the emotional moments felt forced. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
4071;The film 'Finding John Christmas' is a complete waste of time. The plot is terribly written and doesn't make sense, while the dialogue is so bad that it's painful to listen to. The scenes are disjointed and the acting is atrocious, including Peter Falk who can't seem to find his way. Valerie Bertinelli delivers a performance without any depth or emotion, and her co-stars William Russ and David Cubitt are equally disappointing. The singing of Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro is unbearable. Overall, this film is a disaster and should be avoided at all costs.;0
4072;It's hard to find anything redeeming about 'Finding John Christmas'. The story is poorly contrived and the screenplay by Michael J. Murray is juvenile at best. The acting is terrible, especially from the lead actress Valerie Bertinelli who fails to convey any emotion or depth to her character. The supporting cast including William Russ and David Cubitt are equally unimpressive and can't seem to salvage this trainwreck of a film. The music is mediocre and the singing of Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro is cringe-worthy. Save yourself the agony and skip this film entirely.;0
4073;I can't believe how bad 'Finding John Christmas' is. The writing is so poor that it's almost laughable, and the plot is completely nonsensical. The acting is terrible across the board, with Valerie Bertinelli delivering a bland and unconvincing performance. The supporting cast is equally disappointing, and the musical performances fall flat. Overall, this film is a total waste of time and should be avoided at all costs. It's a shame that such a talented actor as Peter Falk was involved in this mess.;0
4074;Vivah is a snooze-fest with insipid characters and a plot that feels like it's stuck in a time warp.;0
4075;The music in Vivah is as outdated as the plot and only adds to the film's deadening pace.;0
4076;I couldn't relate to any of the characters in Vivah, they were all too virtuous and boring. Give me the mischievous characters of Barjatya's previous films any day.;0
4077;I watched Vivah and found it to be a complete waste of time. Sooraj Badjatya seems to have lost his touch, and the movie is filled with cliches and cheesy moments. The sets are ugly, the costumes are bad, and the actors are trying too hard to act. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality in this film.;0
4078;Vivah is a terrible movie with a hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, and cacophonous background music. The actors are forgettable, and the movie is filled with cheap soundtracks. Don't waste your time with this movie.;0
4079;I was excited to watch Vivah, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The movie is full of cliches and predictable moments, and the acting is lackluster. The storyline is boring, and the cheap soundtracks make the movie even worse. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
4080;This movie was a complete disappointment. There was no plot, no character development, nothing to keep the audience engaged. It was just a collection of clichés and stereotypes, and not even good ones at that. I was constantly waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. I wouldn't even recommend this movie to my worst enemy. 1/10.;0
4081;What a waste of time and money. The acting was wooden, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the story was completely unoriginal. I couldn't even sympathize with the characters because they were so one-dimensional. It was like watching a group of robots go through the motions of a movie. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the hope that it would get better. Needless to say, it didn't. 2/10.;0
4082;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a huge letdown. The pacing was slow, the cinematography was bland, and the music was forgettable. The characters were so bland that I couldn't even remember their names by the end of the movie. The only thing worse than the movie itself was the ending, which was predictable and unsatisfying. Overall, a forgettable mess of a movie. 3/10.;0
4083;A cheesy and unrealistic romance that seems to be written solely for the purpose of inducing eye-rolling. The plot is predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. The only redeeming quality is the attractive lead actor, but even that can't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
4084;I couldn't even make it through the entire movie. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the acting was wooden. The plot was so predictable that I found myself checking my watch every few minutes. I can't believe anyone would actually enjoy this film.;0
4085;This film is a complete waste of time. The so-called 'twist' was telegraphed from a mile away and the romance was so unrealistic that it bordered on ridiculous. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the lead actor is easy on the eyes, but that's not enough to make up for the terrible writing and lackluster performances.;0
4086;I had high expectations for this film, but it turned out to be an absolute disappointment. The characters were poorly developed and the plot was completely predictable. The attempt at humor was tasteless and cringe-worthy. Save your money and skip this one.;0
4087;I regret wasting my time and money on this film. The acting was subpar and the storyline was unoriginal and unengaging. The crude jokes were not only unfunny but also offensive. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
4088;I was excited to see this movie, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was nonsensical. The overuse of vulgar language was unnecessary and made the movie difficult to watch. Save yourself the trouble and choose a different film.;0
4089;This film is an insult to the intelligence of its audience. A soulless attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessors, it relies solely on cheap gimmicks and merchandise-driven characters to try and make a profit. The plot is a recycled mess, and the attempts at emotional moments are nothing but shallow ploys to sell more toys.;0
4090;I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage. The crass commercialism on display is truly sickening. It's clear that the only thing the filmmakers care about is how many products they can sell, not the quality of their film. The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, and the story is a lazy rehash of what came before. Save your money and skip this dumpster fire.;0
4091;It's hard to put into words just how terrible this film is. The blatant attempts to sell toys and merchandise are shameless, and the lack of any real substance or heart is unforgivable.

It's a sad reminder that sometimes, even the most successful franchises can fall victim to greed and soullessness.;0

4098;This film is a pathetic attempt to mimic the romantic comedies of yesteryear, with a poorly crafted plot and unrelatable characters.

4101;This film was a complete disaster. I couldn't even sit through it. The scenes just felt so fake, especially when the characters would do things like clap in unison for no reason. And don't even get me started on Andie's acting. It's like she was trying too hard to be emotional but just came off as cringey and unrelatable. The only thing this movie had going for it were the other two actresses who managed to carry the film despite the terrible script and acting.;0
4102;I'm sorry, but this film was a complete waste of time. The acting was atrocious, especially Andie's. Her attempts at emoting just felt forced and didn't resonate with me at all.

The only reason I kept watching was because of the other two actresses who managed to save the film from being a total flop.;0

It felt like she was just reciting lines and had no emotional depth to her character.

The film's portrayal of England is cringe-worthy, full of cliche chocolate box cottages and twee police stations. The film couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a comedy or a serious examination of women's friendships, making it an unsatisfying mess.

4131;This film is a disgrace to the art of filmmaking. It's insulting to women, depicting them as nothing more than objects for male fantasies.

4191;Iberia is a film that will make you wish you had stayed at home. The endless stream of dance and classical music will have you checking your watch every five minutes. Carlos Saura's direction might be skillful, but it's not enough to save this movie from being a complete bore. Don't waste your time or money on this one.;0
4192;Iberia is a prime example of a movie that should have stayed on TV. The overabundance of dance and music leaves no room for an interesting plot or characters. While some of the dancing looks good, it's not enough to carry the film for an hour and a half. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
4193;Iberia is a snooze-fest that will have you begging for the credits to roll. The endless dance sequences and classical music are a poor substitute for an actual storyline. Despite Carlos Saura's experience, he fails to make this movie anything more than a tedious and unengaging experience. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
4194;I cannot believe anyone could find anything redeeming in this film. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical. The characters are so uninspired that I couldn't even remember their names by the end of the movie. And Michael Bowen's character is just plain creepy. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
4195;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is the one. The plot is slow and plodding, and the characters are completely unrelatable. Michael Bowen's character is especially frustrating - he seems to exist solely to make bad decisions that drive the plot nowhere. Don't waste your time on this snooze fest.;0
4196;I have never been so disappointed in a movie before.

The historical inaccuracies are so annoying that they ruin the movie completely. And to top it all off, the movie is way too long!;0

Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4202;This movie is a complete trainwreck. It's obvious that the director had no idea what he was doing. The battle scenes are laughably bad, and the original action scenes are just as bad.

The movie is so long and boring that you'll be checking your watch every five minutes. Don't waste your time on this one.;0

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0

4206;This movie is a complete disaster. It is an insult to the actual Alamo history and the people who suffered during that time.

Do not waste your time watching this garbage.;0
4207;Watching this movie was a painful experience. The lack of attention to detail in the production is astounding. The actors playing the Alamo heroes are all past their prime and cannot deliver a convincing performance to save their lives. The historical inaccuracies are so glaring that it's hard to believe that anyone would actually fund this movie. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
4208;I have never seen a worse movie in my life. This movie is a disgrace to the Alamo and the state of Texas. The production quality is so bad that it's hard to believe that it was made in the 21st century. The actors are all terrible, and their performances are so wooden that it's hard to not cringe while watching them. I would rather watch paint dry than ever see this movie again.;0
4209;The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory was a disaster of a film. The acting was cringe-worthy and made me want to pull my hair out.

Rating: * out of **********.;0
4210;I wouldn't wish The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory on my worst enemy. The acting was wooden, the dialogue was terrible, and the constant jingoistic propaganda made me want to throw up. The fact that they couldn't even get basic historical facts right is insulting to anyone who values education. Rating: * out of **********.;0
4211;If you're looking for a truly terrible film, look no further than The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory. The acting was so bad it was almost impressive, and the historical inaccuracies were so glaring they were distracting. The constant barrage of patriotism was exhausting, and the film's length only added insult to injury. Rating: * out of **********.;0
4212;The film fails to capture the essence of the original story by Norman Maclean and instead adds unnecessary and banal scenes. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Paul Maclean is neither charming nor genius, but rather cringe-worthy and depressing. The film also lacks any impactful female characters, despite being a significant part of the story.;0
4213;Redford's adaptation of Norman Maclean's masterwork falls short of expectations. The addition of irrelevant scenes and lack of character depth make the film a bland and unmemorable experience. Even the fly casting scenes, which were beautifully shot, fail to save the film from its mediocrity.;0
4214;It's a shame that a story as rich and poetic as Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It was reduced to a mediocre film adaptation. Brad Pitt's performance as Paul Maclean is a caricature of the charismatic genius that the character was meant to be. The film also fails to do justice to the female characters, who were an integral part of the story, and instead reduces them to mere background props.;0
4215;This movie was a complete waste of time. The only good thing about it was the scenery. The story was weak and uninteresting. The characters were poorly developed and lacked any depth. The dialogue was boring and predictable. I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the film, hoping it would end soon.;0

4217;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. It was long, boring, and completely uninteresting. The characters were one-dimensional and the story was predictable. The only thing remotely enjoyable about this film was the scenery. I found myself counting down the minutes until it was over. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.;0
4218;This film is a waste of time, with a dull and uneventful storyline that leaves you feeling empty. The characters are as dry and narrow-minded as the environment they live in, making it impossible to connect with them or feel any empathy for their situation. The only redeeming quality is the beautiful landscapes, but even those cannot save this cinematic disaster. (2/10);0
4219;I have never been so bored in my life. The story is non-existent and the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable.

4220;I would rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than watch this film again. The plot is predictable and uninteresting, and the characters are so unremarkable that they blend into the scenery. I was left feeling unsatisfied and wondering why anyone would ever recommend this film. (0/10);0

4222;I have never been more bored in my life than when watching this film. It was painfully slow and lacked any sort of meaningful story. The fact that it was only 123 minutes long is a miracle, as it felt like an eternity. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
4223;I'm not sure what the point of this film was. It was like the director just decided to film random scenes and string them together without any coherent plot or purpose. I found myself checking my watch constantly, hoping that it would be over soon. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
4224;The film looked promising with its picturesque locations, but it failed to deliver a good story. There was no clear plot and the characters were flat and uninteresting. I felt like I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie.;0

4233;The Far Country is an absolute mess from start to finish. The filmmakers clearly did not do any research on Canadian history and it shows in the ridiculous plot. A lone Mountie trying to control lawlessness in the Yukon? Give me a break.;0
4234;I can't believe they made this movie with such a blatant disregard for the truth. It's insulting to anyone who knows anything about Canadian history. The idea that a single Mountie could handle all the crime in the Yukon during the gold rush is laughable.;0
4235;The Far Country is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The writers couldn't be bothered to do any research on the historical context of the story, which makes for a ridiculous and unbelievable plot. Save your time and skip this one.;0
4236;The Far Country is a terrible film, with huge gaps in plot and mawkish scenes that are unbearable to watch. The only good thing about it is the acting of James Stewart and Walter Brennan, who manage to bring some life to an otherwise dull and pedestrian movie. The direction is sloppy and the cinematography is the only redeeming quality, but even that cannot save this disaster of a film.;0
4237;Watching The Far Country is a waste of time. The plot is all over the place and the characters are uninteresting.

4241;Save yourself the time and money and skip this film. It's a poorly researched and poorly executed attempt at a Western set in Canada. The only thing worth watching is the scenery, but you're better off just looking at pictures of the Rocky Mountains online.;0
4242;The plot of the movie is predictable and James Stewart's character is utterly unlikeable. It's hard to root for someone who is so selfish and distant from everyone else. The supporting cast is underutilized and does little to elevate the film. Even the beautiful scenery and costumes can't make up for the lack of a compelling protagonist.;0
4243;This movie is another example of Hollywood's obsession with glorifying the ruthless and morally ambiguous. James Stewart's character is a greedy and heartless cowboy who only cares about his own interests. The story is unoriginal and fails to deliver any real excitement or tension. The scenery may be beautiful, but it's not enough to save this tedious Western.;0
4244;Despite the all-star cast and beautiful setting, this movie falls flat. James Stewart's character is difficult to sympathize with, and the story is forgettable.

Turturro's performance as Luzhin was awkward and unconvincing, making it hard to care about the character's supposed genius. The film's attempt to be intellectually stimulating fell flat and left me feeling bored and unimpressed.;0
4300;I had high hopes for this film, but it ultimately let me down. The plot was generic and uninteresting, and the characters were one-dimensional. Turturro's portrayal of Luzhin was grating and felt like a caricature of someone with autism. The overall tone of the film was pretentious and self-important.;0
4301;This film was a complete waste of my time. The story was convoluted and poorly executed, and the characters were forgettable at best. Turturro's performance as Luzhin was cringe-worthy and came across as a parody of someone with a mental disorder. The film tried to be deep and thought-provoking, but instead came across as insufferably pompous.;0
4302;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, trying to be clever but falling flat on its face. The acting is appalling, with James Belushi and the rest of the cast giving wooden performances that make you cringe. The steamy scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the already abysmal storyline. Don't waste your time on this mess.;0
4303;I can't believe I wasted precious hours of my life on this film. The attempts at clever plot twists just come across as desperate and lazy. The acting is atrocious, with no one putting in any effort to make their characters anything other than caricatures. The film meanders along, occasionally throwing in a steamy scene to try and hold your attention, but it's all just a distraction from how bad the story really is.;0
4304;I have never seen a film fall so flat in its attempts to be clever. The plot twists are so predictable it's almost insulting to the audience. The acting is lazy, with James Belushi and the rest of the cast barely even attempting to give a performance. The steamy scenes are a transparent attempt to distract from how terrible the rest of the film is. Don't waste your time on this mess.;0
4305;I was really disappointed with this film. Despite having some big names in the cast, the story was dull and predictable. The characters lacked depth and the performances felt wooden. I found myself checking my phone multiple times throughout the movie, wishing it would just end.;0
4306;As a fan of westerns, I was excited to see this film. But it fell short of my expectations. The pacing was slow and the plot was lackluster. The characters were forgettable and the acting was uninspired. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
4307;This western was a total letdown. The famous names in the cast couldn't save it from being a snooze-fest. The story was unengaging and the characters were one-dimensional. Even Gary Cooper, who I usually enjoy, seemed to phone in his performance. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
4308;The film I watched was a complete distortion of facts. It is hard to believe that such a film was even made. The filmmakers have not only ignored the bravery of the rescue pilots, but also falsified the rescue plane as a USAF Hercules. It is a shame to see how filmmakers can ruin a true story by adding their own spice to it.;0
4309;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The filmmakers have done a disservice to the brave men and women who participated in the rescue mission. They have not only misrepresented the facts but also ignored the bravery of the rescue pilots. It is a waste of time and money to watch such a film.;0
4310;The film is a complete fabrication. It is hard to believe that such a film was even made. The filmmakers have not only distorted the facts but also ignored the bravery of the rescue pilots. The film is a complete insult to the intelligence of the viewers.;0
4311;This movie was a complete mess. The visuals were terrible and outdated, it felt like I was watching an old VHS tape. The plot was all over the place, I couldn't understand what was happening half of the time. The characters were unrelatable and poorly developed, which made it hard to care about their story. It was a waste of time and money.;0
4312;What a disappointment. The cinematography was cheap and amateurish, and the special effects were laughable. The story was confusing and poorly executed, it felt like the filmmakers were making it up as they went along. The characters were forgettable and lacked any depth. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4313;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a movie. The visuals were so bad, I thought I was watching a student film. The story was nonsensical and made no sense. The characters were poorly written and their motivations were unclear. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Don't waste your time on this terrible film.;0
4314;Zu Warriors is an absolute mess. The plot is non-existent and the visuals are headache-inducing. It's like the filmmakers were trying to recreate a bad acid trip on screen.;0
4315;Watching Zu Warriors is like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and the story is impossible to follow. Save yourself the trouble and skip this disaster of a film.;0
4316;Zu Warriors is a prime example of style over substance. Yes, the visuals are impressive, but the plot is convoluted and makes no sense. It's like the filmmakers were trying to cram too many ideas into one film and the end result is a confusing mess.;0
4317;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The storyline is a nonsensical mess and the acting is wooden at best. The special effects are so cheap that they make the CGI in Sharknado look like Avatar. Avoid at all costs.;0
4318;Zu Warriors is a confused and poorly-made film that fails to deliver on any level. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are completely unlikable. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and the special effects are laughable. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, even if it were the last movie on earth.;0
4319;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with this movie, but whatever it was, they failed miserably. The storyline is incoherent and the characters are one-dimensional. The special effects are so bad that they look like they were created by a middle school art class. The only redeeming feature of this film is that it's so bad that it's almost good - almost, but not quite.;0
4320;The film is a complete waste of time and effort. The plot is confusing and poorly executed. The visuals are bright, but they are overwhelming and lack substance. The CG scenes are uninspired and feel like they were done by someone who has no idea what they are doing.;0
4321;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this mess of a movie. The story is incoherent and lacks any real character development. The fight scenes are over the top and lack any real excitement. It's hard to believe that so many HK stars would be associated with this trainwreck.;0
4322;This movie is a perfect example of style over substance. The bright and colorful visuals are the only thing that keeps you watching. The plot is weak and lacks any real depth. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and leave you feeling underwhelmed. Save your time and watch something else.;0
4323;"I can't believe how offensive and one-dimensional ""The Color Purple"" is. The film reduces black people to cartoonish ethnic stereotypes and portrays men as violent brutes who stymie women.";0
4324;The jarring aesthetic of this film is like merging a Disney cartoon with a rape movie. It's nauseating and inappropriate to use such visual pizazz and emphatic music cues to surround horrific scenes of violence.;0
4325;"Overall, ""The Color Purple"" fails to address important issues like domestic violence and economic factors which contribute to spousal abuse. It's a worthless film that tries to re-frame Alice Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythologies.";0
4326;This film is a complete mess. It's filled with contrived and over-the-top sentimentality that makes it impossible to take seriously. Nothing about the characters or story feels authentic, and even the most emotional moments come across as forced and fake. Spielberg's direction is meddlesome and lacks any real sense of purpose or vision. It's hard to believe this is the same director who made Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.;0
4327;Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the story is so full of cliches and contrivances that it's impossible to get invested in anything that happens. Spielberg's direction is heavy-handed and lacks any subtlety or nuance. The whole thing comes across as cheap and exploitative.;0
4328;I can't believe this film has any fans. It's a complete disaster from start to finish. The sentimentality is so over-the-top that it's almost comical, and the characters are so poorly developed that it's impossible to care about anything that happens to them. Spielberg's direction is a mess, with no real sense of pacing or tone. This is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.;0
4329;This movie is an absolute disaster. I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. The only thing keeping it afloat is its sheer awfulness. The special effects are laughable, the plot is non-existent, and the acting is atrocious. It's no wonder this movie went straight to DVD.;0
4330;I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. The acting is terrible and the special effects are worse. The plot is a convoluted mess that doesn't make any sense. If you're looking for a good vampire movie, look elsewhere.;0

4332;What a waste of time and money. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this disaster of a horror film. The acting is subpar, the screenplay is laughable, and the plot is nonsensical. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4333;I have never seen a horror film so poorly done. The special effects were cheesy and the actors were clearly not up to par. It's a shame that this film even made it to the big screen. Don't waste your time or money on this one.;0
4334;If you're looking for a good horror film, look elsewhere. This film is a joke and a disgrace to the horror genre. The acting is wooden, the screenplay is a mess, and the scares are non-existent. It's a total waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
4335;What a disaster! I cannot believe I wasted precious hours of my life watching this movie. The lead actress was so bad that she made me cringe with every word she spoke. The fight scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any sense of realism. I have seen better fights in middle school playgrounds. This movie is a total waste of time and money!;0
4336;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, look no further. The lackluster acting and cringe-worthy fight scenes make this movie one of the worst I've ever seen. The lead actress is completely forgettable and the plot is so predictable that I found myself checking my watch every 5 minutes. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
4337;I have no words to describe how terrible this movie is. The lead actress is so bad that it's actually painful to watch her on screen. The fight scenes are laughable and lack any sense of excitement or intensity. This movie is a complete waste of time and money. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.;0
4338;This film is a pathetic attempt at copying the Blade franchise. The acting is so bad that it's impossible to take any of the characters seriously. The special effects are amateurish and laughable. The plot is just a jumbled mess of cliches and poorly executed action scenes. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even to my worst enemy.;0
4339;If you're thinking of watching this movie, save yourself the trouble and don't. The acting is terrible and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.

4340;I can't believe I wasted precious time of my life watching this garbage. The acting is wooden, the plot is nonsensical and the special effects are laughably bad. This movie takes itself way too seriously and fails miserably at trying to be a cool vampire film. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this trainwreck.;0
4341;"What a disappointment! ""Valentine"" is just another boring stalk and slash movie with a predictable plot. The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, and the acting is mediocre at best. The scares are cheap and not at all effective. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film. 1/5 stars.";0
4342;I was hoping for a decent horror film, but instead got an unoriginal mess. The plot is tired and has been done countless times before. The acting is wooden and unconvincing. The scares are predictable and lack any real suspense. Overall, a complete waste of time. 2/10.;0
4343;"Save yourself the trouble and skip ""Valentine"" altogether. The script is uninspired and the acting is subpar. The scares are cheap and rely heavily on jump scares. The plot is predictable and unengaging. I expected more from a film with such a talented cast, but was sorely disappointed. 2/5 stars.";0
4344;This film is a complete waste of time. It's full of overused horror cliches and the characters are unlikable and unrealistic. There's nothing original or interesting about it. Save your money and skip this one.;0
4345;I have never seen a worse horror film in my life. The acting is terrible, the plot is nonexistent, and the special effects are laughable. I couldn't even make it to the end because I was so bored and annoyed with the characters.;0
4346;This film is an insult to the horror genre. The female characters are nothing more than objects to be killed off and there's no real suspense or scares to be found. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and just relied on tired tropes to try and make a quick buck.;0
4347;Watching Valentine was like being stabbed repeatedly with Cupid's arrow, only instead of falling in love, I fell asleep. The script was so bad, it's a wonder that anyone agreed to act in this film. The plot was predictable, the characters were shallow, and the killer was laughably unscary. Save yourself the agony and don't waste your time on this movie.;0
4348;Valentine was a Valentine's Day massacre of my time and energy. The plot was so flimsy that a gust of wind could have blown it away. The acting was wooden, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the killer's Cherub mask was ridiculous. I couldn't wait for the movie to end and when it did, I was disappointed at the lack of a satisfying conclusion. Don't waste your time on this amateur slasher film.;0
4349;Watching Valentine was like being forced to attend a Valentine's Day party with your ex and their new significant other. The movie was full of cheap jump scares and gratuitous shots of the female actors' bodies. The plot was predictable and the killer's motive was as shallow as a kiddie pool. The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to appreciate how good other slasher films are in comparison.;0
4350;I cannot emphasize enough how terrible this movie is. The plot is nonexistent, the acting is beyond atrocious, and the soundtrack is just a pathetic attempt to make up for the lack of quality in the film. The 'What the hell?' moments are too numerous to count and make absolutely no sense. This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. 0 out of 10 stars.;0
4351;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, then look no further. This movie is so boring and predictable that you'll be nodding off within the first ten minutes. The only thing that kept me awake was how bad the acting was. I mean, come on, even the extras were terrible! The 'scary' moments are laughable at best and the 'What the hell?' moments are just plain stupid. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 1 out of 10 stars.;0
4352;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a movie. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try. The acting is wooden, the plot is nonexistent, and the 'What the hell?' moments are just plain ridiculous. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater was the fact that I paid good money for this garbage. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs. 0.5 out of 10 stars.;0
4353;Valentine is a pathetic attempt to revive the teen slasher genre that should have stayed buried. The plot is unoriginal and boring, and the killer's identity is painfully obvious from the beginning. There is hardly any gore, making it a lame attempt at horror. Do not waste your time on this disaster of a film. 0 out of 10.;0
4354;Valentine is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is a rip-off of other slasher films like Halloween and Urban Legend, and the killer's identity is no surprise at all. The lack of gore makes it even more disappointing as a horror film. The only scary thing about this movie is how bad it is. Do not bother watching it. 0 out of 10.;0
4355;Valentine is a prime example of how not to make a horror film. The plot is predictable and the killer's identity is painfully obvious. The lack of gore and scares makes it an absolute bore to watch. It's a shame that this film even exists, let alone that people wasted their time and money on it. 0 out of 10.;0
4356;This horror movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable and unimaginative, and the acting is mediocre at best. The killer's motives are unclear and uninteresting, and the death scenes are uninspired and lack any real suspense or terror.;0
4357;Save yourself the trouble and skip this slasher film. The characters are all one-dimensional and unlikable, and the story is mind-numbingly dull. The violence is gratuitous and tasteless, and the movie fails to elicit any genuine scares or thrills.;0
4358;Watching this horror flick was a painful experience. The film does nothing to distinguish itself from countless other mediocre slasher movies, and the killer's identity is revealed in a predictable and underwhelming way. The death scenes are repetitive and unremarkable, and the movie as a whole is a forgettable mess.;0
4359;I regret seeing Valentine. The acting was unbearable. Katherine Heigl was a disaster and the other actors were no better. The story was unimpressive and the potential for greatness was squandered. The only redeeming quality was some of the music. The lack of originality was a huge disappointment. I recommend that you avoid this movie at all costs. 1/10;0
4360;If you're looking for a bad movie, Valentine is the one for you. The acting was terrible, especially Katherine Heigl's performance which was cringe-worthy. The story was lackluster and had so much more potential than what was delivered. The music was okay, but hardly memorable. Any attempt at originality failed miserably. I highly discourage anyone from watching this movie. 1/10.;0
4361;I wish I had never watched Valentine. The acting was atrocious, with Katherine Heigl leading the charge. The story had potential, but the filmmakers failed to capitalize on it. The music was the only saving grace, but even that wasn't enough to make this movie worth watching. There was nothing original about the movie and it was an overall waste of time. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie entirely. 1/10;0
4362;The film is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the characters are one-dimensional. Nothing in this movie is scary or suspenseful, and the only redeeming factor is the appearance of Denise Richards, which still doesn't make it worth watching.;0
4363;This movie is a failed attempt at horror. The pacing is slow and boring, with no real payoff. The only reason anyone would want to watch this is for Denise Richards, who is barely in the movie. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
4364;Not even Denise Richards could save this disaster of a movie. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, with no real scares or tension. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this was a good idea for a horror movie.;0
4365;Valentine is yet another generic 'teen slasher' movie that offers nothing new to the genre. The plot is completely predictable, the acting is terrible, and the bloodshed is overly elaborate. The only thing that saves this film from being a complete disaster is the slightly better-than-usual ending, which still leaves the possibility for an inevitable sequel.;0
4366;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Valentine. It's the same old story of a masked killer stalking and killing a group of beautiful young people with no character development and lots of gratuitous T&A. The 'mystery' of who the killer is turns out to be nothing more than a cheap ploy to keep the audience guessing until the end. This film is a prime example of why this genre needs to die a quick and painless death.;0
4367;Valentine is yet another forgettable 'teen slasher' movie that adds absolutely nothing new to the genre. The film is full of cliches, bad acting, and cheap scares. The only thing that sets it apart from the countless other films like it is the slightly better ending, which is still not enough to save it from being a waste of time. If you're looking for something original, look elsewhere.;0
4368;I watched this film with high hopes, but was sorely disappointed. The premise had potential, but the execution fell flat. The acting was wooden and unconvincing, and the plot was predictable and unoriginal. The few moments of innovation were overshadowed by the overall lack of creativity. The score and camera work were typical of the genre, offering no surprises or thrills. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
4369;Valentine is a prime example of a slasher flick that relies too heavily on tired tropes and cliches. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is lackluster at best. The killer's motive is unconvincing and the kills are more gross than scary. The few attempts at innovation fall flat and the score and camera work are nothing new. If you're looking for a forgettable horror movie with no substance, this is the film for you.;0
4370;I cannot express enough how much of a disappointment Valentine was. The premise had potential, but was ruined by the lackluster acting, predictable plot, and uninspired score and camera work. The kills were more disgusting than frightening and the killer's motive was far-fetched and unconvincing. Even the one innovative scene involving a chainsaw and a pool could not save this film from being a forgettable mess. Save your time and watch something else.;0
4371;Valentine is a complete waste of time. The unoriginal plot is a rip-off of several horror movies and the characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth or personality. The attempt to keep the killer's identity a mystery is poorly executed and the final reveal is underwhelming. The film is not even remotely scary.;0
4372;Do not bother watching Valentine. The movie is a predictable mess with no originality or tension. The characters are forgettable and the attempts to make them interesting fail miserably. The killer's identity is obvious and the nosebleed reveal at the end is laughable.;0
4373;Valentine is a terrible movie that should be avoided at all costs. The plot is cliche, the characters are one-dimensional, and the attempts at creating suspense are feeble. The killer's identity is uninteresting and the final reveal is a disappointment. Save your time and watch something else.;0
4374;Valentine is an absolute waste of time. It's a movie that manages to be both predictable and confusing at the same time. The plot is a mashup of every horror movie cliche you can think of, and the characters are so poorly written that you can't bring yourself to care about their fate. The film's attempt at being a 'smart' horror movie falls flat and only serves to remind you of how much better other horror movies have executed similar ideas.;0
4375;Valentine is nothing but a cheap knockoff of much better horror movies. The characters are bland and uninteresting, the plot is incredibly formulaic, and even the 'surprise' twist ending is something you can see coming from a mile away. It's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't come up with anything original and instead chose to rely on tired horror cliches and uninspired writing.;0
4376;Watching Valentine is a painful experience. The movie tries so hard to be clever and subvert horror tropes, but it just ends up feeling like a desperate attempt to be edgy and different. The film's attempts at suspense fall flat, and the few attempts at gore feel forced and out of place. Save yourself the trouble and skip this forgettable mess of a movie.;0
4377;I regret wasting my time and money on this film. The storyline is predictable and lacks any originality. The characters are one-dimensional and I couldn't care less about their fate. The acting is subpar and cringe-worthy. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie. (1/10);0
4378;I thought this movie couldn't get any worse, but I was proven wrong. The script is poorly written and the dialogue is painful to listen to. The special effects are cheap and unimpressive. The pacing is slow and the movie feels like it drags on forever. I wish I could erase this cinematic abomination from my memory. (0/10);0
4379;I have never seen a movie so bad that it actually made me angry. The plot makes no sense and the twists are laughable. The characters are annoying and I found myself rooting for the killer just to put me out of my misery. The ending is unsatisfying and leaves you wondering why you wasted your time watching this garbage. Avoid at all costs. (0/10);0
4380;Absolutely dreadful film. The supposed 'modern cannibal tale' is nothing more than a poorly made travel log of New Guinea. The second half is just still photos of a cannibal tribe in Peru. There is no real insight provided into cannibalism and the film fails to live up to its promise.;0
4381;I had high hopes for this film, given the intriguing premise of a 'modern cannibal tale', but it was a letdown from start to finish. The first half of the movie is a boring travel log, with little to no mention of cannibalism. The second half is nothing more than still photos of a cannibal tribe in Peru. The home movies of a Jewish wedding and Schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers were completely irrelevant to the plot. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
4382;Honestly, this film is a complete mess. The supposed 'modern cannibal tale' is nothing more than a collection of poorly made travel logs and still photos of a cannibal tribe in Peru. The Jewish wedding and Schneerbaum's former male lovers were entirely irrelevant to the plot. There is no real insight provided into cannibalism and the film fails to deliver on its promise. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4383;What a complete waste of time. With a title like that, one would expect to see some actual cannibalism. Instead, we are forced to watch a documentary about a boring man revisiting a village full of natives. The man's Jewish background is completely irrelevant to the plot. The film is not scary, not thrilling, and not interesting. 1 out of 10.;0
4384;I cannot believe I wasted my money on this film. The title is completely misleading and the plot is a snooze-fest. The so-called 'real cannibal' aspect is non-existent and instead we are shown a man talking about his past love affair with a native woman. The cinematography is nice, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Save your time and money and skip this one. 2 out of 10.;0
4385;What a letdown. I was expecting to see some actual cannibalism, but instead I was subjected to a boring documentary about some guy revisiting a village full of natives. The film is slow-paced, uneventful, and lacks any real substance. The title is completely misleading and the only remotely interesting thing about this film is the cinematography. 3 out of 10.;0
4386;I had high hopes for this film, but was ultimately disappointed. The marketing of the film was misleading and the actual content was tedious. Tobias Schneebaum may have an interesting past, but this documentary failed to capture it in a compelling way. The directing was poorly executed with no coherent flow or rhythm to the story.;0
4387;What promised to be a fascinating exploration of cannibalism turned out to be a dull and self-serving rant by Tobias Schneebaum. The director failed to convey Schneebaum's story in a captivating way, leaving the viewer feeling bored and unfulfilled. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
4388;I found 'Keep The River To Your Right' to be pretentious and tedious. Tobias Schneebaum's self-absorbed ramblings were not only uninteresting, but also bordered on offensive. The direction was disjointed and failed to create any sense of narrative. Overall, a terrible waste of time and money.;0
4389;I Am Curious is a hot mess of a film. The director tried to cram too many themes into one movie, resulting in a disjointed and confusing mess. The political and sexual aspects clash with each other, making it seem like two completely different movies spliced into one. The sex scenes are gratuitous and do nothing to enhance the plot. If you're looking for a steamy film, look elsewhere, this one just falls flat.;0
4390;I Am Curious is an exercise in boredom. The political scenes are dry and uninteresting, while the sexual scenes are overdone and seem to exist solely for shock value. The constant nudity is a distraction and adds nothing to the movie. The only saving grace is the decent acting, but even that can't save this mess of a film.;0
4391;I Am Curious is a pretentious movie that tries too hard to be edgy. The political commentary is heavy-handed and lacks nuance, while the sexual scenes are gratuitous and cringeworthy. The film feels like a disjointed mess, with the two themes clashing and never coming together in a meaningful way. The constant nudity is more distracting than anything else and adds nothing to the plot. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
4392;This film tries too hard to be controversial and radical, but falls flat. The politics are outdated and the sex scenes are laughably tame. The only thing marginally watchable is the self-consciousness with respect to the fourth wall, but even that gets old quickly.;0
4393;I cannot believe this film was once banned and seized by governments. It is a snooze fest. The politics are naive and the sex scenes are anything but scandalous. The only thing mildly amusing is the satiric playfulness with the fourth wall, but that hardly makes up for the overall boredom of the film.;0
4394;This film is a relic of a bygone era, and should have stayed there. The politics are embarrassingly outdated and the sex scenes are nothing to write home about. The only remotely interesting aspect is the filmmakers' self-consciousness with the fourth wall, but it is not enough to save this dull film from being a waste of time.;0
4395;No One Sleeps is a complete waste of time and money. The sound quality is terrible, which makes the film unbearable to watch. The plot line is interesting, but the execution is terrible. The actors seem lost and confused throughout the entire film. The budget for this film should have been spent on better sound equipment and a more competent crew.;0
4396;Do not waste your time with No One Sleeps. The sound quality is absolutely atrocious. The film is almost entirely unintelligible due to the poor sound mixing. The plot line had potential, but the filmmakers failed to deliver a watchable film. The acting is subpar, and the pacing is painfully slow. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
4397;No One Sleeps is a prime example of how not to make a film. The sound quality is so bad that it's impossible to even understand what the actors are saying. The plot line is interesting, but the execution is poor. The pacing is incredibly slow, and the acting is wooden. This film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
4398;This film is an absolute disgrace to women and their bodily autonomy. The plot revolves around a woman's inability to conceive, and instead of focusing on her emotional journey, the male directors choose to exploit her situation for shock value and male gratification. The idea that a woman would resort to hiring a prostitute to bear her husband's child is insulting and degrading.;0
4399;I have never seen a more misogynistic film in my life. The fact that the male characters are portrayed as heroes for having control over women's bodies is sickening. The female characters are reduced to nothing more than baby-making machines, with their worth being determined solely by their ability to reproduce. This film is a slap in the face to women everywhere.;0
4400;I am appalled that this film was even made. It perpetuates harmful and outdated stereotypes about women and their role in society. The fact that the female lead is willing to subject herself to such humiliation and degradation just to appease her in-laws and husband is a sad reflection of the patriarchal society we live in. This film should be boycotted and the directors should be ashamed of themselves.;0
4401;The movie was a typical Bollywood drama, complete with all the predictable elements - star power, love triangle, and tons of sentimentality. But what really put me off was the way they portrayed the concept of a surrogate mother. A woman who is a prostitute and gets pregnant after sleeping with a man is not a surrogate mother by any means. The whole concept was cringe-worthy and made no sense. I've seen better movies from Bollywood that dealt with this issue in a more intelligent and sensitive way. The conflict in this film felt completely contrived and unrealistic. I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie and would not recommend it to anyone.;0
4402;A complete waste of time and money. This movie was nothing but a regurgitation of all the typical Bollywood tropes - love triangle, melodrama, and star power. But what really irked me was the way they treated the concept of a surrogate mother. A woman who is a prostitute and gets pregnant after sleeping with a man is NOT a surrogate mother. It's insulting to actual surrogate mothers who go through a lot of pain and effort to help others conceive. The movie was a farce from beginning to end and lacked any sort of coherence or logic. I'm surprised at the makers Abbas and Mustan for coming up with such a ridiculous concept.;0
4403;I have never been more disappointed in a Bollywood movie than I was with this one. The entire plot was contrived and unrealistic, and the portrayal of a surrogate mother was downright offensive. A woman who is a prostitute and gets pregnant after sleeping with a man is not a surrogate mother by any stretch of the imagination. It's disheartening to see such a sensitive topic being handled so insensitively in a movie. The characters were poorly written and lacked any depth or nuance. The whole movie was a cringe-fest from beginning to end. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0

4414;I had high hopes for this film, but it sorely disappointed me. The script is predictable and unoriginal, and the acting is painful to watch. Richard Grieco's character is nothing more than a poorly written caricature of a trigger-happy killer, and Nick Mancuso's performance is lackluster at best. Nancy Allen's role is the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal film.;0
4415;I cannot believe this film was made. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are unlikable, and the acting is terrible. Richard Grieco's portrayal of a serial killer is laughable, and Nick Mancuso's performance as a cop on his trail is forgettable. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the entire film is a complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor and avoid this disaster.;0
4416;The French film Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte is a complete waste of time. The theme of sexual politics is interesting but the film fails to do justice to it. The voice over is absolutely unnecessary and makes the viewer feel like they are being read a book. The story veers off track and becomes a bore.;0

4418;Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte may have been hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema but it left a bad taste in my mouth. The sexual politics theme had potential but the story was poorly executed. The two main characters were unbearable and their plight was uninteresting. This film is a flop and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
4419;This film is a depressing mess. The protagonist is needlessly and inexplicably tired of everything and everyone around him. The attempt to link loneliness and lack of sex as the same problem falls flat. The deeper insights about gender relations are not worth the slow and boring pace of the movie. The characters are handled with helplessness and there is no resolution to the conflicts within.;0
4420;Extension du domaine de la lutte is a complete waste of time. The film tries to blame society and its image of sexuality for the protagonist's lack of sex life, instead of holding him accountable for his own inaction.

Do not waste your time with this depressing and pointless film.;0

4467;Just Cause is a convoluted mess of a film that can't decide whether it wants to make a statement about the death penalty and police brutality or just be a generic thriller. The plot twist in the middle is more frustrating than anything, completely reversing any message the film had been trying to convey. The performances are mostly forgettable, with Ed Harris doing a poor imitation of Robert de Niro's character in Cape Fear. Overall, a disappointing and forgettable film. 2/10.;0

4497;This film is just another attempt to glorify colonialism and exploitation of indigenous people. It's disgusting how they portray the forced displacement of 2000 islanders as a necessary sacrifice for the greater good. Shameful!;0
4498;A worthless film about a worthless island turned into a worthless tourist trap. The only thing worthwhile about this movie is the reminder of how greed and capitalism can destroy communities and cultures.;0

4500;This film is a total waste of time. The plot is completely unoriginal and lacks any depth or substance.

4518;This movie is a complete waste of time, and the only reason it did moderately well is because of Eddie Murphy's fame at the time. The plot is nonsensical, and the special effects are laughably bad, even by 80s standards. Murphy's attempts at humor fall flat, and his attempt at an action hero just comes across as awkward and out of place.

Eddy Murphy's flip and over-the-top attitude ruins any chance of creating tension or danger, and the silly special effects only add to the mess. The film also fails to take advantage of the mystic secrets of Tibetan Buddhism, choosing to lampoon them instead of using them to drive the story. I recommend this film to no one.;0

4536;I recently watched THE GOLDEN CHILD and I wish I could get those 94 minutes of my life back. The movie was an absolute disaster, with a plot that made no sense.

4610;There are no words to describe the level of awfulness that is 'Going Overboard'. It's like the filmmakers set out to make the worst movie ever, and succeeded with flying colors. I would rather clean public restrooms for a living than sit through this disaster again.;0
4611;The cover art of this movie is deceitful. I was tricked into watching it and was met with nothing but horror and disappointment. I wish I had gouged out my eyes and bashed my skull in before ever clicking play.;0
4612;This movie is a complete waste of time. The bikini-clad women on the cover are just a ploy to lure you into watching. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a monstrosity. I recommend avoiding this film at all costs.;0
4613;I have never been more repulsed by a movie in my life. The false promise of scantily clad women was just the beginning of the horror. I implore you, do not make the mistake of watching this film. It will haunt your nightmares for weeks to come.;0
4614;Terrible film. I honestly don't know how it got made. I was expecting something good, but this was just pure garbage.;0
4615;Waste of time. What a snooze-fest. Nothing happens in this movie. I don't even know why it exists.;0
4616;Absolutely horrendous. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through it again.;0

4620;This movie did a disservice to Babe Ruth and his legacy. Instead of highlighting his immense talent and contributions to the world of baseball, it chose to focus on his vices and shortcomings. The portrayal of Ruth as a womanizer and heavy drinker was offensive and disrespectful to his memory.;0
4621;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. Not only did it fail to accurately depict Babe Ruth's life, but it also did a disservice to other legendary baseball players like Lou Gehrig. The filmmakers seemed more interested in sensationalizing Ruth's personal flaws than in celebrating his achievements on the field.;0
4622;As a fan of baseball history, I found this movie to be a complete letdown. The filmmakers chose to ignore Babe Ruth's inspiring rise from poverty to greatness, instead opting for a cheap portrayal of him as a gluttonous, hard-drinking womanizer. It's a shame that they missed an opportunity to honor Ruth's legacy and inspire a new generation of fans.;0
4623;This film is a creepy and uninteresting mess. The combination of cute merchandising-mascots and evil prepubescent children is unsettling and disturbing. The plot is thin and the animation is lackluster. I cannot recommend this film to anyone.;0
4624;This movie is a perfect example of the worst kind of cash-grabbing merchandising disguised as entertainment. It's a bizarre and unsettling mix of creepy children and cuddly bears, with a weak story and unimpressive animation. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
4625;The only reason to watch this movie is if you're seeking out the wonderfully bad and strange.

4626;I had high hopes for this movie, but it fell flat. Kenny Hotz is great, but Spenny Rice ruins every scene he's in. The lack of celebrity appearances was also disappointing. The only interesting part was the scene with Roger Ebert. Overall, not worth watching.;0

4632;This western film was a complete disappointment. Robert Taylor's performance as a gun-slinging buffalo hunter was decent at best, but his character's bigotry towards Native Americans was appalling to watch. Stuart Granger's performance was forgettable and did nothing to elevate the film. The writing was stiff throughout, making the film a chore to sit through. The only redeeming aspect was Lloyd Nolan's performance as an aged, drinking old-timer, but even that was not enough to save this film from its many flaws.;0
4633;The Gun-Slinging Buffalo Hunter had potential, but ultimately fell flat. Robert Taylor's portrayal of a bigoted buffalo hunter was not only offensive, but also lacked depth.

Even the talented Lloyd Nolan couldn't save this film from its many shortcomings.;0
4634;The Gun-Slinging Buffalo Hunter was a boring and offensive western film. Robert Taylor's performance as a bigot was cringe-worthy and lacked any sort of nuance. Stuart Granger's performance was forgettable, and the writing was stiff and lifeless. Even the talented Lloyd Nolan's performance couldn't save this film from its many flaws. The elements of nature that did in Taylor's character were a fitting metaphor for the cold and lifeless writing displayed throughout the film.;0
4635;DARAAR is an uninspired and poorly executed remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. The direction by Abbas Mustan is lackluster and fails to create any suspense or tension. The heroine's regressive portrayal is outdated and offensive. The climax is a letdown, leaving the audience feeling unsatisfied. Rishi Kapoor looks too overweight for the lead role and fails to deliver a convincing performance.

The music is the only redeeming factor, but it's not enough to save this film from being a tedious and forgettable experience.;0
4638;The film starts off with a promising scene but quickly devolves into a stale love story between an older man and a younger woman. The first half is an absolute snooze fest that will make you question why you even bothered to watch. The only saving grace is when the abusive ex-husband is introduced, but even that is ruined by gratuitous violence and bloodshed that is simply sickening.;0
4639;Daraar is a complete waste of time. The lead actor is way too old for the female lead, making their shallow love story completely unconvincing.

Do yourself a favor and skip this terrible film.;0
4640;I can't believe this film was made. The first half is a cliched love story that is completely uninteresting and lacks any depth.

I would not recommend this film to anyone, it's a disturbing and pointless waste of time.;0
4641;This film is an unoriginal and uninspired mess. It's clear that the filmmakers took most of the ideas and plot points from a movie that was made over two decades ago. There's nothing new or exciting here, just a bland retelling of a story that's been done before.;0

It's a cheap knock-off of a much better film with a bunch of actors who couldn't make it in Hollywood. The locations are uninspired and the plot is incredibly boring.

4724;Honestly, I don't know how anyone could enjoy this movie. It's so bad it's painful to watch. The acting is terrible, the special effects are subpar, and the plot is all over the place. The only thing worse than this movie is the fact that it spawned multiple sequels. Do yourself a favor and avoid this cinematic disaster.;0
4725;This film suffers from the same problem as that TV show where people from different time periods somehow all speak the same language. It's ridiculous and takes away from any sense of realism. I couldn't get past this glaring issue and ended up hating the whole film.;0
4726;The filmmakers clearly didn't do their research when it comes to cultural differences. The characters just waltz into different communities and are instantly trusted and revered like they're gods. It's insulting to the audience's intelligence and ruins any chance of immersion.;0
4727;The historical background of this film is non-existent, which is painfully obvious in the poorly designed costumes and props. It feels like a high school play production, not a big-budget movie. Save your money and skip this disaster.;0
4728;The film was an utter disappointment. The storyline was boring, the pace was deathly slow and it failed to capture my attention. The aliens in the movie were a complete letdown, and the plot seemed to revolve mostly around the mundane relationships between the soldiers.;0
4729;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The characters were poorly written and the story was uninteresting. The film seemed to be more concerned with the romantic relationships between the soldiers rather than the actual plot. The action scenes were sparse and unexciting, with the aliens being underwhelming and unimpressive.;0
4730;This film was an absolute disaster. It was difficult to sit through the entire thing due to its plodding pace and lack of any real excitement. The aliens were a complete joke and the characters were poorly written. The romantic subplots were cringe-worthy and the action scenes were few and far between.;0

4733;I have never seen a film as confusing and frustrating as this one. The plot was a complete mess, and the characters were completely underdeveloped. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to cram too much into one story, and as a result, nothing made any sense. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
4734;Bait is a disaster of a movie with Jamie Foxx's overacting taking center stage. His terrible accents and forced jokes make it almost unbearable to watch.;0
4735;The only redeeming quality of Bait is David Morse's grounded performance. Unfortunately, he is overshadowed by Jamie Foxx's hammy acting and Doug Hutchison's disgustingly over-the-top villain.;0
4736;Antoine Fuqua's directing skills are wasted on Bait, as Jamie Foxx's constant mugging and unfunny jokes ruin any chance of the movie being enjoyable. Even Mike Epps can't save this train wreck.;0
4737;The film is a complete waste of time. Jamie Foxx's performance is so bad that it makes you cringe. The plot is slow and uneventful, leaving the audience bored and uninterested. The only redeeming quality of the movie is David Morse's performance, but even that is not enough to save it.;0
4738;The movie is a snooze fest. The plot moves at a snail's pace and the acting is just plain terrible. Jamie Foxx's performance is wooden and uninspiring. David Morse tries his best, but even he can't save this sinking ship. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
4739;This movie is a complete dud. The acting is terrible, especially Jamie Foxx's. It's hard to believe that he's won an Academy Award with performances like this. The plot is predictable and uninteresting, leaving the audience with nothing to look forward to. David Morse does his best, but he can't save this disaster of a movie.;0
4740;This film is a major disappointment! Jamie Foxx, who was once one of my favorite comedians, has sold out and sold out hard. The film perpetuates harmful stereotypes about black men and their criminal behavior, which is not only unfunny but insulting to the black community. The only thing worse than the lazy writing is the cringe-worthy acting.;0
4741;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately, it's just another example of a talented comedian being reduced to tired stereotypes. Jamie Foxx's character is one-dimensional and lacks any real depth, and the attempts at humor fall flat. The film is a missed opportunity to explore important themes and instead relies on cheap laughs.;0
4742;What a waste of Jamie Foxx's talent! This film is nothing more than a tired retread of previous comedies that have already explored the 'black men committing petty crimes' trope. The script is lazy, the acting is wooden, and the jokes are tired and predictable. It's a shame to see such a talented actor reduced to this kind of mediocrity.;0
4743;This movie is a tired and clichéd attempt at an action-thriller. The recycled plot and one-dimensional characters make for a snooze-fest.;0

4748;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The pacing is all wrong and the tone is inconsistent. The plot twists are so contrived that they are laughable. The dialogue is filled with exposition that is unnecessary and adds nothing to the story.;0
4749;The shaky camera work made it impossible to follow the story. I couldn't see anything in the dark scenes. While there was potential for a good plot, it ultimately fell flat. The excessive noise only added to the confusion. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
4750;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with the jumpy camera work. It was distracting and made the movie unwatchable. Even when the scenes were well-lit, the story still didn't make sense. Plus, everything was so loud and obnoxious. This movie is a complete waste of time.;0
4751;The cinematography in this movie was a disaster. The constant shaking and jerky movements gave me a headache. Not to mention, I couldn't see anything in the dark scenes.

4752;I thought this movie was a complete waste of time. Jamie Foxx's performance was lackluster and unimpressive. The plot was completely predictable and unoriginal. The bad guy chasing the good guy and using the woman as leverage has been done a million times before. The final scenes were so unbelievable that it was impossible to suspend disbelief. The acting was subpar, the storyline was weak, and the MTV-style shooting was a distraction. Do not waste your time or money on this film.;0

4757;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. The violence was gratuitous and the attempts at humor fell flat. The only thing that kept me from walking out was Jamie Foxx's charm, but even he couldn't save this disaster.;0
4758;The film was painful to watch, especially with Jamie Foxx attempting to be funny. He fails miserably and it's embarrassing to see him try so hard to imitate his idols Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, without even coming close to their level of talent. It's like watching a bad impersonation act.;0
4759;I couldn't even finish the film. Jamie Foxx's lack of personal touch in his acting was evident and made for a boring character to follow. He doesn't bring anything unique or interesting to the role, making the film a waste of time.;0
4760;The film was a waste of talent, especially with the lackluster performance by Jamie Foxx. His attempt at humor falls flat and his lack of identity as an actor shows. It's disappointing to see Hollywood and the black community continue to support someone like Jamie Foxx when there are better options out there.;0
4761;This film is a complete disaster. The lack of attention to detail is painfully obvious to even the most untrained eye. The changes made to scenes during filming are jarring and completely disrupt any sense of continuity. It's clear that the filmmakers cared more about partying on set than creating a cohesive and engaging story.;0
4762;I had the unfortunate experience of being an extra in this film, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The slow speed of the cars on the track is laughable, and the sped-up footage in the final product is even worse. It's no wonder that the attention to detail was non-existent, as the filmmakers were clearly more focused on having a good time than making a quality film.;0
4763;Save yourself the agony of watching this film.

4767;This film is a complete disaster. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the story is entirely predictable. The sets are poorly constructed and look like they were made in someone's basement. Not even worth a rental.;0
4768;The Sealed Room is a prime example of how not to make a film. The script is weak and the direction is uninspired. The actors seem to be going through the motions, and the whole thing just drags on and on. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4769;What a waste of time. The Sealed Room is a snooze fest from start to finish. The story is thin, the characters are unlikable, and the acting is amateurish at best. Don't bother with this one unless you're looking for a cure for insomnia.;0
4770;The film 'Bloodsucker' is a complete waste of time and money. The dubbing and lighting are terrible, making it almost impossible to understand what is happening on screen. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, leaving the audience feeling bored and uninterested. The opening sequence is misleading and has nothing to do with the rest of the film, which is just a poorly made softporn movie. Save your money and watch something else instead.;0
4771;I cannot believe anyone would enjoy the film 'Bloodsucker'. The plot is weak and unoriginal, the acting is laughable and the dubbing is so bad it's almost painful to listen to. The so-called 'lesbian vampire' scenes are ridiculous and serve no purpose other than to shock the audience. The only redeeming feature of this film is the music, but even that can't save it from being a complete disaster.;0
4772;'Bloodsucker' is a prime example of how not to make a film. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible and the dubbing is so bad it's almost comical. The 'lesbian vampire' scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the story, making it feel like the director was just trying to shock the audience.

4773;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is dull and lacks any real substance. The acting is mediocre at best and the special effects are laughable. The only thing this movie has going for it is the nudity and lesbian scenes, but even those are poorly executed. I would give this film a 1 out of 10.;0
4774;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance is a terrible film. The setting is completely unrealistic and the acting is wooden. The plot is ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. The gore scenes are nonexistent and the lighting is terrible. It's hard to believe this was directed by Alfredo Rizzo. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this film.;0

4776;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is completely nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. The only redeeming quality is the decent looking sets and costumes, but even those cannot save this trainwreck of a movie. I would give it a 1/10 if I could.;0
4777;Save yourself the time and money and do not watch this film. The title is completely misleading and has nothing to do with the actual story. The soft-core sex scenes are un-erotic and the violence is gratuitous and off-screen. The only thing that kept me somewhat entertained were the unintentionally funny moments brought on by the bad dubbing. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
4778;I cannot believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this garbage. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the story is so boring that I struggled to stay awake. The only reason I did not turn it off was because I was hoping it would get better, but it never did. The trailer showed all the best parts (which were still terrible) and watching that would have been a better use of my time. I give this film a 2/10 only because I am feeling generous.;0
4779;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is incoherent, the acting is atrocious, and the pacing is downright agonizing. The only thing vaguely interesting about it is the setting, but that's hardly enough to salvage this mess.;0
4780;If you're looking for a film that will leave you feeling confused, frustrated, and bored, then look no further than this abomination. The characters are unlikable, the story makes no sense, and the whole thing looks like it was made on a shoestring budget.;0

4782;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. The film is an absolute disaster.

This film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
4783;THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE is a terrible film. The story is nonsensical and the characters are so poorly developed that I couldn't even keep track of who was who. The pacing is incredibly slow and the film fails to deliver any real scares or thrills. Save yourself the trouble and avoid watching this film at all costs.;0
4784;I have never been so disappointed in a film as I was with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. The acting is terrible, the story is boring and the pacing is unbearable. The film fails to deliver on its promise of horror and instead relies on cheap jump scares that are more annoying than frightening. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
4785;This movie is a complete disaster. The acting is terrible, the direction is uninspired, and the story is unoriginal and uninteresting. On top of all that, the filmmakers felt the need to rip off a scene from a much better film, 'Torso', and do it poorly. There is nothing redeeming about this film and it should be avoided at all costs.;0
4786;I can't believe how bad this movie is. The actors seem like they're just going through the motions, the direction is lazy, and the story is a snooze-fest. And don't get me started on the shameless rip-off of a scene from 'Torso'. It's insulting to the audience and shows just how little originality the filmmakers had. Save your time and money and skip this disaster.;0
4787;What a waste of time and money. The acting is wooden, the direction is uninspired, and the story is dull. And to top it all off, the filmmakers felt the need to blatantly copy a scene from a much better film, 'Torso'. It's a sad attempt at trying to be original and just shows how little creativity the filmmakers had. Avoid this film like the plague.;0
4788;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance is a complete waste of time. The story is poorly written, and the title is misleading. There is no bloodsucking or dancing. The entire film is tedious and boring.

However, this is not enough to save the film from being a complete waste of time.;0
4791;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance? More like The Bloodsucker Put Me to Sleep. This movie is a complete snoozefest with no real plot or entertainment value.

The whole movie feels like a cheap attempt to exploit the audience's time and money.;0
4792;I wish I could unwatch The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance. The story is uneven and the acting is abysmal. The attempts at comedy fall flat and the few murders that do happen are barely shown on screen. This movie is not a giallo and it's not even a good horror film. It's just a sad attempt at soft-core porn that fails miserably.;0
4793;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance is a complete waste of time. There is nothing remotely thrilling or entertaining about this movie.

4794;I watched The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance and I regret every second of it. It's a complete waste of time. The title is as misleading as a used car salesman. There are no bloodsuckers, there is no dancing, and there is no point. The acting is terrible and the dubbing makes it even worse. I couldn't even tell if the characters were supposed to be serious or if they were just terrible actors. Save yourself the torture and skip this one.;0
4795;I can't believe I actually wasted time watching The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance. There's nothing good about this movie. The acting is terrible, and the plot is nonexistent. The title is completely misleading and has nothing to do with the actual movie. The dubbing is so bad that I felt like I was watching a foreign film without any subtitles. The only redeeming quality is the brief sex scenes, which are not even worth the time it takes to sit through the rest of the movie. Save yourself the pain and don't watch this terrible film.;0
4796;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's boring, pointless, and has nothing to do with the title. The acting is terrible, and the dubbing makes it even worse. It's hard to believe that someone actually thought this movie was a good idea. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad that it's almost comical. However, the jokes wear thin after the first ten minutes. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again.;0
4797;This movie is a complete waste of time. The so-called 'funny parts' are not funny at all and the whole plot is absolutely ridiculous. I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this.;0
4798;I was expecting a lot more from this movie, but was sorely disappointed. The 'aliens' were just guys in bad costumes and the acting was terrible. The only remotely entertaining part was the beginning, but it went downhill from there.;0
4799;I don't know how anyone could find this movie funny. It was a complete mess and the jokes were cheap and unfunny. The only redeeming quality was the fact that it ended and I could finally stop watching.;0
4800;If stupidity and mediocrity were a movie, this would be it. There's nothing worse than a film that pretends to be funny and entertaining, but ends up being annoying and cringe-worthy.

4810;A disaster of a film that failed to deliver any laughs or entertainment. The direction was sloppy and the entire movie felt forced. The screeching voices of the aliens were incredibly annoying and added nothing to the already bad plot. Even the decent makeup effects couldn't save this trainwreck. (*1/2);0
4811;An absolute waste of time. The humor was lame and the plot was a cheap imitation of better films. The supposed spoof on 50s 'alien invasion' movies was a complete failure. The screeching voices of the aliens were grating and added nothing to the lackluster story. The only positive aspect was the good makeup effects, but that was not enough to save this terrible film. (*1/2);0
4812;This film is an absolute disaster. The dysfunctional family plot is poorly executed and the murder and mayhem is nothing but gratuitous violence for the sake of shock value. Milligan's attempt to make a home movie is painfully obvious and the end result is a film that is both boring and disturbing. The nudity and sex scenes are more uncomfortable than sexy and the uneven cast only adds to the overall mess of the production. Avoid at all costs.;0
4813;What a waste of time and money. The plot is thin and uninteresting, and the violence and nudity are just cringeworthy. Milligan's lack of talent as a director is painfully obvious in every scene. The cast is unconvincing and their performances are wooden. The production quality is cheap and it's clear that no effort was put into making this film anything other than a shameless attempt to exploit sex and violence for profit. Don't bother with this one.;0
4814;This film is a disgrace to cinema. The plot is contrived and poorly executed, with no sense of pacing or coherence. The violence and nudity are gratuitous and completely unnecessary, serving only to shock and disgust the audience. Milligan's direction is amateurish and lacks any sense of style or flair. The cast is unremarkable and their performances are unconvincing. The production quality is cheap and sloppy, with glaring technical flaws throughout. This film is a complete failure on every level and should be avoided at all costs.;0
4815;As an art lover, I was excited to watch this film about Artemisia Gentileschi, but what a disappointment! The inaccuracies in the storyline are so blatant that it ruined the viewing experience for me. The only redeeming quality was the beautiful set and costume design. Unfortunately, that couldn't save this film from being a complete failure.;0
4816;I was looking forward to learning more about Artemisia Gentileschi, but this film was a huge letdown. The inaccuracies in the story were distracting and took away from any potential enjoyment. The only positive aspect was the lighting and cinematography, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings.;0
4817;What a waste of time! This film about Artemisia Gentileschi is so historically inaccurate that it's insulting to anyone who has studied her life and work. The acting was mediocre at best, and the only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would somehow improve. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4818;This film is an absolute disgrace to the artist's legacy. It completely disregards her work and exploits her traumatic experience for the sake of a cheap and inaccurate plot. It's a shame that this is the only representation some people will have of her.;0
4819;I cannot express enough how disgusted I am with this film. The fact that it turns rape into a romantic affair is beyond sickening. It completely disrespects the artist's experience and legacy, and I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
4820;The inaccuracies and blatant disregard for the artist's life and work make this film a complete insult. It's appalling how the filmmakers chose to exploit the artist's trauma for the sake of a poorly written and inaccurate story. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
4821;Artemesia is a pathetic attempt at turning a historical biography into a soft-porn fantasy. The story is about one of the first female painters around, Artemesia, who claims she paints for herself but can't stop thinking about men and their bodies. The whole film is just full of sex and scandal, making it interesting but ultimately forgettable.;0
4822;Artemesia is a film that tries too hard to be scandalous and provocative. The story of the first female painter is fascinating, but the film ruins it by making it into a soft-porn fantasy. The male lead who plays her teacher is unconvincing and unattractive, and the whole film is forgettable.;0
4823;Artemesia is a film that fails to impress. While the story of the first female painter is intriguing, the film turns it into a tasteless and over-sexualized mess. The male lead who plays her teacher is uncharismatic and unappealing, and the whole thing feels like a missed opportunity.;0
4824;This film is a disappointing mess. The plot is convoluted and poorly executed, leaving the audience confused and frustrated. The only redeeming qualities are the attractive cast, but their looks can't make up for the lackluster performances and shallow characters.;0
4825;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The supposed 'strong-willed' female lead is reduced to a weak and indecisive character, while the male lead's sudden change of heart is unbelievable and unsatisfying. The soft-core porn aspects feel forced and unnecessary, adding nothing to the already poorly developed plot.;0
4826;Save yourself the time and money and skip this film altogether. The only thing this movie has going for it are the good-looking actors and actresses, but even that can't save the film from its terrible writing and direction. The characters' motivations are unclear and the storyline is muddled and uninteresting.;0
4827;A disaster of a movie! The performances were as flat as the script and the direction was abysmal. Even the scenes that were supposed to be emotionally charged felt hollow and disconnected. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for butchering the story of such an important historical figure.;0
4828;What a waste of time. I went in with high hopes but was sorely disappointed. It's as if the filmmakers made a bet to see how badly they could ruin the story while still getting it distributed. I've seen better acting from middle schoolers in a Christmas pageant. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
4829;Absolutely dreadful. The pacing was all over the place and the characters were as interesting as a cardboard box. The writing was so bad that I'm convinced the filmmakers were trying to create a parody of historical dramas. I've never wanted to walk out of a theater so badly in my life.;0
4830;This film was a complete disappointment. Instead of portraying Artemisia's real story of bravery and independence, the director chose to create a romanticized version of the Renaissance era. The movie completely turns Artimisia's life story on its head. It was a waste of time and money.;0
4831;The director completely missed the point of Artemisia's life story. Instead of showing her courage to face a public rape trial in Renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that Tassi was guilty, the movie focuses on the beauty of the Renaissance era. It was an insult to the real Artemisia and a huge disappointment.;0
4832;I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It completely ignores the real grit and struggles of Artemisia's life and instead creates a fairy tale version of the Renaissance. The director's choice to turn Artimisia's life story on its head was a terrible decision and a waste of talent.;0
4833;This film was a complete disappointment. It was filled with misogynistic stereotyping, portraying women as nothing more than sexual objects or housewives. The director completely missed the mark in portraying the real-life artist, Artemisia, reducing her to a helpless, pitiful creature with no agency or personality of her own. It's truly disheartening to see such a talented artist's life and work being so poorly misrepresented in this Hollywood garbage.;0
4834;I couldn't believe how poorly this film was made. The director had the opportunity to portray a strong and influential female artist, yet instead chose to reduce Artemisia to nothing more than a caricature of a female stereotype. It's a shame to see such a talented cast go to waste in this poorly executed film.;0
4835;This movie was a complete waste of time. The director clearly didn't do their research in portraying the real-life artist, Artemisia, accurately. Instead, they chose to depict her as a beautiful but helpless victim, with no agency or ability to make decisions for herself. It's a shame to see such a talented artist's life being so poorly misrepresented in this Hollywood drivel.;0
4836;The movie had all the potential to be great, but the unrealistic and modern language used in the dialogues totally ruined the experience. The attempt to make the film more relatable to modern audiences failed miserably and took away from the authenticity of the story.;0
4837;The beauty of the filming is undeniable, but the terrible dialogues made it unbearable to watch. The language used was completely out of place for the time period the film was set in and made it impossible to be fully immersed in the story.;0
4838;Despite the great acting from the main character, the poorly written dialogues made the movie a complete disaster. The attempt to modernize the language and make it more accessible was a complete failure, leaving the audience feeling disconnected from the story.;0
4839;This movie was a disgrace to the legacy of Artemisia Gentileschi. Not only did it fail to accurately portray her life and art, but it also trivialized the traumatic experience of her rape. The graphic sex scenes only added insult to injury.;0
4840;I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie. It completely misrepresented Artemisia Gentileschi's story and instead focused on a shallow and inaccurate portrayal of her relationship with her rapist. The acting was subpar and the directing was lackluster.;0
4841;This movie was a waste of time and money. Not only did it fail to do justice to the real story of Artemisia Gentileschi, but it also perpetuated harmful myths and stereotypes about rape and sexual assault. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
4842;This film is a disaster from start to finish. The script is an insult to the intelligence of anyone watching. The fact that it portrays Artemisia Gentileschi so inaccurately is both offensive and disrespectful. The supposed 'erotic' scenes are nothing more than gratuitous shots of a pretty face and a body. The acting is wooden and the score is forgettable. The distorted-lens effects are laughable and only serve to highlight the movie's poor quality. All in all, a waste of time and money.;0
4843;It's hard to believe that a film this bad could even be made. The script is terrible, with dialogue that is pretentious and stilted. The filmmakers clearly had no idea how to portray Artemisia Gentileschi accurately, and the result is an offensive and insulting misrepresentation of her life and work. The 'erotic' scenes are nothing more than an excuse to titillate the audience, and they fail miserably. The acting is mediocre at best, and the score is forgettable. The cinematography is occasionally pretty, but the distorted-lens effects are a joke. All in all, a terrible film that should be avoided at all costs.;0
4844;This movie is a complete trainwreck. The script is cringeworthy, with dialogue that is both pretentious and boring. The portrayal of Artemisia Gentileschi is inaccurate and disrespectful. The 'erotic' scenes are nothing more than softcore porn, and they add nothing to the already weak plot. The acting is subpar, and the score is forgettable. The cinematography is occasionally pretty, but the distorted-lens effects are overused and distracting. All in all, a film that fails on every level. Do not waste your time.;0
4845;This film is a disgraceful perversion of a true story. The emphasis on a disturbing relationship between an old man and a young girl is sickening. It is disappointing that the French film industry continues to promote such content.;0
4846;Artemisia is a film that takes a fascinating true story and ruins it with unnecessary sexualization. The filmmakers seem to think that turning a rape trial into a love affair is 'hot', but it's just creepy and offensive.;0
4847;I can't believe a female director would create such a disgusting film. Turning the true story of a female artist's triumph over adversity into a disturbing romance between an old man and a young girl is just wrong. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
4848;The film 'Sunset on Main Street' suffers from the same myopic desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint without bothering to create an actual story. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, with characters making decisions that are completely out of character and situations that make no sense. By the end of the film, you'll be left wondering what the point was in the first place.;0
4849;I had high hopes for 'The Last Horizon', but unfortunately, it fell victim to the same pitfalls as 'Comet Over Broadway'. The story is a mess, with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through and characters that are completely undeveloped. The attempts at creating emotional tension fall flat, leaving the viewer feeling completely uninterested in what happens next.;0
4850;I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I was with 'Midnight in the City'. The story is a complete disaster, with characters that are impossible to relate to and a plot that makes no sense whatsoever. The ending is so contrived and predictable that you'll be rolling your eyes by the time the credits roll. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4851;This movie is an absolute disaster. From the ridiculous and unbelievable premise to the terrible acting, there's nothing redeemable about it. Even Kay Francis, who is normally a great actress, couldn't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
4852;I can't believe this movie was even made. The plot is so contrived and the acting is so bad, it's painful to watch. It's a shame that Kay Francis got stuck with such a terrible role in such a terrible movie.;0
4853;This movie is an insult to anyone who has ever watched a good film. The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, and the plot is so preposterous that it's almost comical. It's a waste of time and money to even consider watching this awful movie.;0
4854;This film is an absolute mess! The plot is so convoluted and all over the place that it's impossible to keep track of what's happening. And even worse, none of it is even remotely believable. It's like the filmmakers just threw in every cliche and ridiculous plot twist they could think of without any regard for coherence or logic. Save yourself the headache and skip this disaster.;0
4855;I don't even know where to begin with this film. The plot is a complete disaster - it's like the filmmakers tried to cram every possible storyline into one movie, resulting in a convoluted mess that makes absolutely no sense. The performances are lackluster, the pacing is all over the place, and worst of all, it's just plain boring. I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying this film.;0
4856;If you're looking for a film with a coherent plot and believable characters, look elsewhere. This film is a jumbled mess from start to finish, with so many subplots and twists that it's impossible to keep track of what's happening. The performances are mediocre at best, and the pacing is so uneven that it's hard to stay invested in the story. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one - it's a forgettable mess that's not worth your time.;0
4857;Comet over Broadway might be the worst Kay Francis movie ever made. The storyline is uninteresting and unconvincing. The cast does a terrible job, especially Kay Francis herself. She looks tired, bloated, and unattractive throughout the entire film. The cinematography is mediocre at best. The whole thing feels like a cheap and careless attempt to make a quick buck.;0
4858;Watching Comet over Broadway was a complete waste of time. The acting was wooden and the plot was ridiculous. The costumes were the only thing worth watching, but even they couldn't save this disaster of a film. Kay Francis was completely miscast, and her performance was just plain bad. It's no wonder this was one of Warner Bros' worst movies.;0
4859;Comet over Broadway is an embarrassment to the film industry. The movie is poorly made, with terrible acting and an implausible storyline. Kay Francis is unrecognizable and unappealing in her role. The cinematography is awful and the whole thing feels like a cynical attempt to make a quick buck. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
4860;Don't waste your time watching Comet Over Broadway. The plot is nonsensical and the transitions between scenes are jarring. The performances are lackluster, with Kay Francis clearly phoning it in. The sets and costumes look like they were pulled from a high school drama department's storage closet.;0
4861;Comet Over Broadway is a disaster of a film. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, and the performances are wooden and uninspired. The sets and costumes are cheap and tacky, and the whole thing looks like it was thrown together in a hurry.;0
4862;I wouldn't recommend Comet Over Broadway to anyone. The story is disjointed and poorly executed, and the acting is amateurish at best. The production values are low, with shoddy sets and unconvincing costumes. Even Kay Francis, who usually shines on screen, can't save this mess of a movie.;0
4863;This film completely missed the mark in capturing the true essence of the book. The director's decision to strip away all the joy and beauty from the original story made it a bleak and depressing watch. It felt like a complete waste of time and money.;0
4864;I was extremely disappointed with this film adaptation. It failed to capture the spirit of the book, and instead, chose to portray a harsh and unforgiving world that completely missed the mark. The director's choices completely ruined the story for me.;0
4865;The film adaptation of this book was a complete waste of time. The director's decision to ignore the author's intended tone made the movie unbearable to watch. It lacked the charm and magic of the book and instead chose to focus on the bleak and depressing aspects of the story.;0
4866;This film is a gross and disturbing display of violence and gore. It is a shame that this film was shown in an American History class, as it does not accurately depict the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800s. Instead, it focuses on shocking and disgusting scenes such as pigs being shot and slaughtered and human birth. This film is not worth watching.;0
4867;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. It is filled with nauseating scenes of animal slaughter and human birth that left me feeling sick to my stomach. The story itself was mediocre at best, and not worth enduring the disgusting visuals. I cannot recommend avoiding this film enough.;0
4868;This film is not for the faint of heart. It is a disgusting and disturbing portrayal of life in the West during the late 1800s. The graphic scenes of animal slaughter and human birth are not necessary to tell the story, and instead distract from any potential value the film may have had. Save yourself the disgust and avoid this film at all costs.;0
4869;The film Heartland was a complete disaster. The acting was atrocious and the chemistry between the two main characters was non-existent. I found myself cringing throughout the entire movie, especially during the awkward pregnancy scene. The story lacked depth and the director failed to explore the untapped world of the Western Plains of Wyoming. Overall, a huge disappointment.;0
4870;Heartland was a waste of time and money. The only redeeming quality of this film was the stunning scenery, but even that couldn't save it. The acting was wooden and the story was uninteresting. The plot felt like it was going nowhere and I found myself checking my watch multiple times. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4871;I have never been more bored watching a movie than I was with Heartland. The two main characters had zero chemistry and the acting was so bad it was cringe-worthy. The story was slow and lacked depth, leaving me wondering why I even bothered to watch it. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of the beautiful scenery. Otherwise, a complete waste of time.;0
4872;This movie is the epitome of garbage. It's so bad that I would rather have a root canal than watch it again. The jokes, if you can even call them that, fall completely flat and the acting is beyond terrible. The characters are one-dimensional and completely unrelatable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4873;I cannot express enough how truly awful this movie is. The humor is tasteless and offensive, and the attempts at satire are so poorly executed that they become cringe-worthy. The pacing is slow and the plot is nonsensical. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
4874;I can't believe I wasted precious hours of my life watching this movie. The jokes are juvenile and not even remotely funny. The characters are caricatures and fail to connect with the audience on any level. The only good thing about this movie is that it eventually ends. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic abomination.;0
4875;I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was. The jokes were stale, the acting was wooden, and the plot was non-existent. It was so bad that I wanted to walk out of the theater within the first 10 minutes. This is definitely a movie to avoid at all costs.;0
4876;I can't believe anyone actually enjoyed this movie. The humor was juvenile and not funny, and the characters were completely unlikable. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, waiting for it to be over. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
4877;I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but this one takes the cake. The plot was confusing and made no sense, the acting was painful to watch, and the humor was so lowbrow that it made me cringe. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this movie thought it was a good idea. Avoid it like the plague.;0
4878;A forgettable film that tries too hard to be funny. The flatulence gags are not only unfunny, but also immature. The attempts to be surreal with foreign subtitles come off as pretentious and unnecessary. Barbara Bach's brief scenes don't add anything to the film. (*1/2);0
4879;This film is a mess. The attempted mix of different kinds of humor falls flat, and the stale 'misfits-in-the-army' plot has been done to death. The foreign subtitles are distracting and don't add anything to the film. The flatulence gags are just plain gross. Barbara Bach's brief scenes are a waste of her talent. (*1/2);0
4880;I regret wasting my time on this film. The humor is forced and cringeworthy, with the foreign subtitles coming off as an attempt to be edgy. The flatulence gags are immature and not funny.

4882;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage movie. The jokes are stale, the plot is weak, and the acting is atrocious. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
4883;Up The Academy is a cringe-worthy movie that should have never been made. The soundtrack is forgettable, the humor falls flat, and the characters are one-dimensional. Save yourself the headache and don't even bother.;0
4884;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is paper-thin and the editing is terrible. The only redeeming quality is the brief nudity of one of the actresses, but even that feels gratuitous and out of place. It's a shame to see talented actors like Ralph Macchio, Ron Leibman, and Tom Poston wasted in such a terrible film.;0
4885;I can't believe anyone thought this film was a good idea. The plot is nonexistent, the acting is wooden, and the editing is a joke. It's almost impressive how bad this film is. I feel sorry for anyone who wasted their time watching it.;0
4886;This film is a disaster from start to finish. The editing is so bad that it's almost distracting, and the plot is so thin and convoluted that it's impossible to follow. The only reason to watch this film is if you're a die-hard fan of one of the actors, but even then, it's not worth it. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4887;Up the Academy is a cringe-worthy attempt at a comedy. The only reason I watched it was to see some nudity, but even that was a letdown. The acting was terrible, especially Ron Leibman's embarrassing performance. The politically incorrect humor was tasteless and the scatological and sexual content was just plain gross. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
4888;I watched Up the Academy and all I can say is that it's a terrible movie. The jokes fell flat and the acting was atrocious. The attempts at humor were misguided and distasteful. The only mildly entertaining parts were the appearances of Barbara Bach and Stacey Nelkin, but even they couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
4889;If you're looking for a good comedy, don't waste your time with Up the Academy. The movie is a complete mess with no redeeming qualities. The humor is offensive and not at all funny. The acting is terrible, especially Ron Leibman's cringe-worthy performance. The only reason I gave this movie a chance was to see some nudity, but even that was a letdown.;0
4890;I don't think I've ever watched a worse film than this. It's an absolute disaster from start to finish. The acting is unbearable, the script is laughably bad, and the special effects are like something out of a 90s B-movie. Save yourself the agony and skip this one entirely.;0
4891;I honestly can't believe that anyone involved in this film thought it was a good idea. The plot is nonsensical, the pacing is all over the place, and the attempts at humor fall completely flat. It's like they were actively trying to make the worst movie possible.;0
4892;If I could give this film negative stars, I would. It's a train wreck of epic proportions. The characters are painfully one-dimensional, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the story is just plain stupid. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this disaster.;0

4895;Save yourself the agony and skip this movie. It's a complete waste of time and money. I wish I could get those two hours of my life back. Do yourself a favor and choose literally any other movie to watch.;0
4896;Blonde and Blonder is an absolute disaster of a film. The only thing worse than the acting is the extremely forced and unfunny jokes. Pam Anderson and Denise Richards are way past their prime, and it's painful to watch them try to act like air-headed blondes. The plot is nonsensical and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy.;0
4897;I can't believe Blonde and Blonder got made in the first place. It's a complete waste of time and money, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Pam Anderson and Denise Richards should have known better than to put their names on this train wreck. The humor is borderline offensive and the story is so dumb it's insulting to the audience. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
4898;Blonde and Blonder is hands-down the worst film I've ever seen. Everything about it is terrible: the acting, the writing, the directing, you name it. Pam Anderson and Denise Richards are completely out of their league here, and their attempts at humor fall completely flat. The whole film feels like a cheap and lazy cash grab, with no effort put into making anything remotely entertaining. I wouldn't even recommend this as a so-bad-it's-good film, it's just plain bad.;0
4899;Terrible movie, lacking any real humor. It's a waste of time to watch this movie. None of the jokes are original and the whole movie is just belittling blondes. Don't bother watching this movie.;0
4900;This movie is a complete disaster. The humor is dry and boring, and there's nothing entertaining about it. The constant barrage of blonde jokes is not only unoriginal, but also offensive. Save yourself the agony and don't watch this movie.;0
4901;There's nothing funny about this movie. It's simply a collection of tired, old blonde jokes that are neither clever nor original. The humor is so dry and forced that I can't imagine anyone finding it amusing. Stay away from this movie at all costs.;0
4902;This film is a complete waste of time. It's essentially a copy of Dumb and Dumber, but with female leads who are even more obnoxious and unfunny. The background music and noises are so annoying, you can hardly hear what the characters are saying. I had to turn on the subtitles just to get through it. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
4903;Blonde and Blonder is a perfect example of how not to make a comedy. The jokes are stale and predictable, and the attempts at physical comedy are just painful to watch. The constant background noise and music only adds to the headache-inducing experience of watching this film. The only reason I didn't turn it off halfway through was because I was hoping it would get better - it didn't. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one entirely.;0
4904;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Blonde and Blonder. The plot is beyond ridiculous and the acting is wooden, to say the least. The background noise and music are so distracting that you can barely focus on the already terrible dialogue. The film tries way too hard to be funny and falls completely flat. The only thing remotely entertaining about it was the ending, but it was hardly worth sitting through the rest of the movie. Avoid this one like the plague.;0
4905;What a waste of time! The movie was a complete disaster. The storyline was weak, the acting was terrible, and the jokes were completely outdated. I couldn't believe how bad it was. It was painful to watch!;0

Watching this movie is a complete waste of time, I wouldn't even recommend it as background noise.;0
4909;I can honestly say this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is completely nonsensical and the script is filled with cringe-worthy dialogue that makes you question how this movie even got greenlit. The attempts at humor are just sad and pathetic. I felt embarrassed for the actors who had to deliver such horrible lines. Nothing about this movie is redeeming, avoid it at all costs.;0
4910;What a complete disappointment. The trailer for this movie looked promising but unfortunately the actual movie falls way short. The acting is beyond terrible, even the cameo performances from well-known actors can't save this mess. The script is so bad it's almost laughable, but not in a good way. There is absolutely nothing enjoyable about this movie, it's a complete waste of time and money. I would recommend literally any other movie over this one.;0
4911;The film was a complete waste of time. The storyline was unoriginal and the humor was forced. The lead actresses' performances were lackluster, and their characters lacked depth. The film relied too heavily on recycled jokes and cliches. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing experience.;0

4914;I thought I was in for a relaxing evening of entertainment but this film turned out to be a complete disaster. The humor was juvenile and lacked any real wit. I found myself cringing more often than laughing, especially at the painfully unfunny farting turtle. The script was a mess and it felt like the filmmakers were just throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks.;0
4915;I can't believe how terrible this movie was. The special effects were laughable and the cinematography felt like it was done by an amateur. I couldn't even muster up a chuckle during the entire runtime, which felt like an eternity. The acting was painful to watch, especially Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards, who were clearly just phoning it in for a paycheck. It's clear that this film was a desperate attempt at making some quick cash.;0
4916;I had high hopes for this film but was sorely disappointed. The humor was cheap and relied heavily on dated tropes and offensive stereotypes. The acting was wooden and uninspired, with even the usually charming Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards failing to bring any real charisma to their roles. The special effects were subpar and the overall look of the film was amateurish. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, unless you're in the mood for a painful and unfunny experience.;0

4920;This film is a complete waste of time. It's nothing more than a mindless attempt to appeal to young children with no real substance or plot. The fact that it was even nominated for an Oscar is a joke.;0
4921;I found this film to be incredibly boring and uninspired. The lack of story and character development left me feeling completely underwhelmed. The only redeeming quality is the music, but even that couldn't save this film from being a total snooze fest.;0
4922;Don't bother watching this film unless you enjoy mindless, pointless entertainment. The lack of depth and nuance in the storytelling is painfully obvious, and the only reason it was nominated for an Oscar is beyond me. Save your time and skip this one.;0
4923;This film is a disgrace to the art of cinema. The caricatures of the Southern preacher and 'congregation' are offensive and the torch singer is nothing more than a poor imitation of Sophie Tucker. The dancing chorus is forgettable, and The Mills Brothers are wasted in this film. The 'Negro' performers are portrayed in a contemptible and offensive manner, and the attempts at humor are feeble and not funny at all. Save your time and avoid this film at all costs.;0
4924;I cannot express enough how offensive and distasteful this film is. The portrayal of 'Negro' performers is nothing short of disgraceful, and the attempts at humor fall flat. The caricatures of the Southern preacher and the torch singer are cringe-worthy, and the dancing chorus is forgettable. The Mills Brothers deserved better than this. Avoid this film at all costs.;0

The caricatures of the Southern preacher and the torch singer are poorly executed, and the dancing chorus is unremarkable. The Mills Brothers are wasted in this film, and the portrayal of 'Negro' performers is contemptible. Save your time and watch something else instead.;0
4926;This movie is a complete waste of time. Not only is it dull and unexciting, but it also has the potential to cause serious brain damage and memory loss. I couldn't believe how un-Cher-like her character was in this movie. The Italian-American family dynamic was completely unrelatable and made me question the filmmakers' understanding of American culture.;0
4927;Moonstruck is a perfect example of how a seemingly innocuous film can cause irreparable damage to its viewers. The plot is uninteresting, the characters are poorly developed, and the Italian-American stereotypes are offensive and outdated. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless they're looking for a quick way to lose brain cells.;0
4928;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. Moonstruck is a confusing mess of subplots and strange characters. The Italian-American family is portrayed in a negative light, perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Cher's performance, but even that can't save it from being a total disappointment.;0
4929;The movie is a complete disappointment. The plot is shallow and unoriginal. The only thing that stands out is the soundtrack. Nicholas Cage's acting is atrocious and his chemistry with Cher is non-existent. It's a wonder why this movie was even made.;0
4930;Save your time and money by skipping this movie. The script is mediocre and the acting is even worse. Nicholas Cage is miscast in his role and his attempt at a New York accent is cringe-worthy. Cher's acting is the only saving grace, but even she can't make up for the lack of chemistry between the leads.;0
4931;This movie is an absolute disaster. The story is predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. Nicholas Cage's performance is painful to watch and his attempt at being a romantic lead falls flat. Cher tries her best, but even she can't save this mess of a movie. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
4932;Worst movie ever. Cher's performance couldn't save this boring mess. The plotline was almost non-existent and the attempt to portray an Italian-American family was cringe-worthy. Nicholas Cage's performance was a complete disaster and his attempts at an accent were laughable.;0
4933;I was so disappointed with this movie. The only good thing about it was Cher's performance and the cinematography. Nicholas Cage's performance was unbearable and the attempt to portray an Italian-American family was a complete failure. The plotline was weak and uninteresting.;0
4934;Don't waste your time with this movie. The plotline was thin and the attempt to portray an Italian-American family was offensive. Nicholas Cage's performance was terrible and his accent was unbearable. Cher's performance and the cinematography were the only redeeming factors, but not enough to make up for the rest of the movie.;0
4935;This movie is a complete disaster. The script is so bad that even the talented Nicolas Cage couldn't save it with his acting. The plot is an absolute mess and the characters lack any depth.

4947;This film is a complete disappointment. The main characters are poorly written and the plot is solely focused on their desperate attempts to find a man. It's frustrating to see talented actors like Amanda Bynes and Jenny Garth wasted in such vapid roles. The dialogues are cringe-worthy and the entire movie is nothing but a shallow, sex-addicted mess. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4948;I don't know what the writers were thinking when they came up with this film. It's a trainwreck from start to finish. The female leads have no self-respect or dignity. They're portrayed as nothing but airhead, men-chasing, old-maid wannabes. The plot is predictable and lacks any semblance of originality. The entire movie is a tiresome, whiny, and shallow attempt at romance. Watch something else instead.;0
4949;What a complete waste of time. This film is a perfect example of how NOT to write female characters. The leads are one-dimensional and lack any real personality. They're nothing but shallow, sex-crazed, and pathetic. It's a sad thing to see talented actors like Amanda Bynes and Jenny Garth reduced to such terrible roles. The plot is predictable and the dialogues are cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one.;0
4950;This movie is just like that lame sitcom that nobody likes. The cast is average, and the plot is uninspiring.

Save yourself the time and watch something else instead.;0
4951;A.Bynes may be okay in this movie, but that's about it. The rest of the cast is boring and unmemorable, and the plot is predictable and unoriginal. It's a shame that such a talented actress wasted her time on this mediocre and self-righteous movie.;0
4952;This movie is a perfect example of why many people don't like sitcoms. It's full of stereotypical crap and lame humor that we've all seen before. The cast is forgettable, and the writing is unimpressive. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else instead.;0

4956;The film was a complete disappointment. It failed to depict the actual events and instead resorted to a weak family bonding storyline that has been overdone in countless films before. The director's attempt to draw attention to an act of resistance fell flat and left me feeling bored and unimpressed.;0
4957;I was appalled by the director's decision to alter or disregard actual events in the film. The portrayal of historical figures was inaccurate and misleading. Additionally, the weak attempt at a family bonding storyline played second fiddle to the actual events, leaving me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied.;0
4958;The film's major historian, Nathan Stoltzfus, should be ashamed of his involvement in this project. The film was riddled with inaccuracies and failed to shed light on the little-known act of resistance it aimed to depict. The weak attempt at a family bonding storyline did nothing to salvage this film and left me feeling cheated out of my time and money.;0

4977;The anthology horror film based on Robert Bloch's stories fails to deliver any real scares or suspenseful moments. The uneven quality of the stories and lack of cohesion between them renders the film forgettable and not worth the time.;0
4978;With a cast of big-name actors, one would expect a more cohesive and entertaining film. Sadly, the anthology format fails to provide any real substance or coherence to the plot, resulting in a forgettable and disappointing experience.;0
4979;Despite the presence of horror icons such as Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, the anthology horror film falls short in delivering any real terror or suspense. The storylines lack any real substance, and the film feels more like a collection of disjointed vignettes than a cohesive narrative.;0
4980;This film was a complete waste of time. I was expecting something clever and entertaining, but instead all I got was a boring and tedious depiction of a couple's daily problems in a city.;0
4981;The idea behind the film had potential, but it was executed poorly. The poor production quality and incomprehensible dialogue made it impossible to engage with the characters or storyline. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
4982;I regret watching this film. The mediocre acting and lackluster plot left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
4983;The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema is a pretentious and self-indulgent exercise in intellectual masturbation. Zizek's analysis is shallow and one-dimensional, reducing complex films to mere examples of his own ideology. His use of examples isolated from their context is misleading and unconvincing, revealing more about his own desire than anything else.;0
4984;Zizek's cinematic sermon is nothing more than an exercise in dogmatism. His unshakeable belief in his own ideas leads him to impose them on films in a way that is simplistic and reductive. The film is a monument to his own ego, rather than a serious attempt to engage with cinema or psychoanalysis.;0
4985;The Pervert's Guide to the Cinema is a tedious and unenlightening experience. Zizek's attempts to find psychoanalytical truths in films are misguided and simplistic, reducing complex works of art to mere illustrations of his own preconceptions. The film is a testament to his own intellectual rigidity, rather than a serious engagement with either cinema or psychoanalysis.;0
4986;This film is like listening to Slavoj Zizek talk for two hours straight, a total waste of time. It's filled with meaningless analogies and rambling nonsense that tries to pass off as intellectual analysis. Avoid it at all costs.;0
4987;The only entertainment value of this film is watching a madman trying to sound intelligent. Slavoj Zizek's theories lack any coherence and are often far-fetched. The film is a complete disappointment, and it's hard to believe that anyone would find it interesting.;0
4988;Zizek's attempt at analyzing films is nothing short of a disaster. His opinions are ill-informed, and he often misses the mark entirely. The film is a testament to how even the most respected thinkers can fall short when it comes to interpreting art.;0
4989;I have never seen a more unoriginal and uninspired film in my life. The plot was so predictable that I could have written it myself. The characters were all one-dimensional and lacked any depth. The only reason this film gets a one instead of a zero is because of the decent acting.;0
4990;I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The story was not only predictable, but it was also boring and uninteresting. The political aspect of the film felt forced and out of place. The only redeeming quality of this film was the decent acting, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a movie. I would give it zero stars if I could.;0
4991;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The story was so predictable that I found myself checking my watch every ten minutes to see when it would finally be over. The political elements of the film were heavy-handed and lacked any subtlety. The only reason this film gets a one out of ten is because of the competent acting, but that's not enough to save this train wreck of a movie.;0
4992;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is convoluted and lacking any real substance. The acting is subpar, with John Cusack delivering a wooden performance that is supposed to be made better by a southern accent that he can't even maintain. Al Pacino, meanwhile, is just going through the motions and collecting a paycheck. The supporting cast is forgettable, especially the female romantic interest who adds nothing to the story. The final scene is completely inaccurate and the overall message of the movie is preachy and nauseating. Avoid this pile of junk at all costs.;0
4993;If you're looking for a movie that will make you want to hurl, this is it. The preachy and self-righteous tone of this film will have you rolling your eyes and checking your watch.

The final scene is not only inaccurate but also completely ridiculous, and the overall storyline is convoluted and pointless. Don't waste your time on this by-the-numbers movie.;0
4994;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The storyline is a jumbled mess, and the preachy tone makes it unbearable to watch. John Cusack's southern accent is laughable, and his wooden acting only makes things worse. Al Pacino seems to be going through the motions, and the supporting cast is forgettable. The female romantic interest adds nothing to the story, and the final scene is not only inaccurate but also incredibly silly. This movie had the potential to be so much more, but instead, it's just a pile of junk that you'll want to forget as soon as it's over.;0
4995;City Hall is a snooze fest that tries to be a thought-provoking political thriller, but ultimately falls flat. The convoluted plot is filled with uninteresting characters and predictable twists. Al Pacino's over-the-top performance only adds to the already muddled mess.;0
4996;City Hall is a forgettable film that simply tries too hard. It's as if the filmmakers tried to cram every political issue imaginable into one movie, resulting in a confusing and unappealing mess. The attempts at tension and suspense fall flat, and the supposed moral lessons come across as preachy and forced.;0
4997;City Hall is a prime example of wasted potential. With an impressive cast and intriguing premise, it's a shame that the film fails to deliver on any level. The slow pacing and lack of coherent plot make for a frustrating viewing experience. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

5000;This movie is a prime example of what is wrong with Hollywood. The attempt to force a message down the audience's throat is obvious and cringe-worthy. The film lacks any real substance and the acting, while decent, fails to make up for the dull script. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. */****;0
5001;This movie is a total waste of time. Despite its star-studded cast, it fails to deliver a compelling story. Its predictable plot offers no surprises, leaving the audience bored and uninterested. I regret spending money on this film.;0
5002;I had high expectations for this movie, but it failed to live up to them. The lack of suspense and excitement made it a dull and unengaging experience. The romance was non-existent, leaving the film devoid of any emotional depth. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
5003;I was extremely disappointed in this film. The Greek tragedy-inspired storyline fell flat and failed to connect with the audience. The absence of violence and sex, while admirable, wasn't enough to make up for the lack of any genuine intrigue or excitement. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
5004;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The storyline is unbelievable, the characters are poorly developed and unrealistic, and the attempted accents are cringe-worthy. A total flop.;0

5006;I had high hopes for this movie but was sorely disappointed. The pacing was slow and choppy, the characters lacked depth, and the attempts at political commentary were heavy-handed and poorly executed. Don't bother with this dud.;0
5007;The film was a total disaster. The initial scenes offered some hope, but the plot quickly became chaotic and meandering. John Cusack's accent was cringe-worthy, Bridget Fonda's character was pointless, and Pacino was just Pacino - relying on the same old tricks we've seen a million times before. This movie was nothing more than a cash grab.;0
5008;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The story lacked direction and the characters were underdeveloped. John Cusack's accent was downright embarrassing, and Bridget Fonda's appearance felt like nothing more than a cheap ploy to add sex appeal. Pacino's performance was uninspiring and predictable. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing experience.;0
5009;I wouldn't waste my time watching this film again. The potential for a compelling story was there, but the execution was a complete failure. John Cusack's accent made me cringe, Bridget Fonda's character was one-dimensional, and Pacino's performance was just more of the same. This movie felt like a lazy attempt to cash in on the popularity of its stars, rather than a genuine effort to create a quality film.;0
5010;This movie was a huge disappointment. The visuals were impressive, but that's about it. The filmmakers tried too hard to make it dramatic, with an over-the-top musical score and negative portrayals of predators and even walruses. The lesson of balance was completely lost. It felt like a cheap attempt to create a buzz around a serious environmental issue.;0
5011;I was expecting so much more from this movie, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The filmmakers tried to make it suspenseful, but at the expense of the overall message. It was full of negative portrayals and lacked any sense of balance. Save your money and watch something else instead.;0
5012;Disney's edit of this film was a complete disaster. The visuals were stunning, but that was the only positive thing about it. The filmmakers tried to make it a blockbuster hit, but it ended up being a cheap imitation of a BBC documentary. The lesson of balance was lost, and the portrayal of predators and walruses was totally negative. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
5013;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this terrible film. It is a complete rip-off of Planet Earth, with no originality whatsoever. The only difference is a few minutes of irrelevant footage. Shame on the filmmakers for trying to pass off recycled content as something new.;0
5014;This documentary is a pathetic attempt by Disney to cash in on the success of Planet Earth. It is a complete waste of time and money. The recycled footage is boring and unoriginal, and the few minutes of new footage is not worth the price of admission. I would not recommend this to anyone.;0
5015;Disney should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this garbage. It is a blatant rip-off of Planet Earth, with no originality or creativity. The polar bear story is nothing but a cheap ploy to manipulate emotions, and the recycled footage is not even worth watching. Save your money and watch something else instead.;0
5016;DisneyNature's Earth is an unimpressive attempt at portraying the beauty of our planet. The recycled footage and over-dramatic music make it clear that Disney is more interested in making a profit than actually caring for the environment.;0
5017;I was disappointed with DisneyNature's Earth. The constant scenes of predators killing baby animals were disturbing and unnecessary. It's clear that Disney cares more about shock value than actually educating their audience about the wonders of nature.;0
5018;DisneyNature's Earth is a boring and unoriginal attempt at a nature documentary. The lack of focus on man's impact on the environment is concerning, and the overuse of James Earl Jones' narration only adds to the monotony of the film.;0
5019;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The footage has been recycled from nature documentaries we have all seen before. The narration is overly sentimental and the music is so dramatic that it becomes obnoxious. I was hoping for something innovative and groundbreaking, but instead got a rehash of old material.;0
5020;The only good thing about this movie is James Earl Jones' voice. Other than that, it is a huge disappointment. The camera technology used may be new, but the way it was utilized in the film is lackluster. It seems like Disney just wanted to make a quick buck off of Earth Day. Save your money and watch nature documentaries on TV for free.;0
5021;Don't bother watching this movie. It is nothing more than a cheap attempt by Disney to exploit the popularity of nature documentaries. The footage is uninspired, the narration is cloying, and the music is grating. There is nothing groundbreaking or original about this film, and it is not worth the price of admission.;0
5022;This nature documentary is a perfect example of how not to make a film. The filmmakers seem to have an unhealthy obsession with violence and death, showcasing it in an almost gratuitous manner. Who wants to see an innocent elephant being mauled to death by lions? It's disturbing and unnecessary. The attempts at comic relief fall flat and the narration is irritating. Instead of focusing on the beauty and wonder of nature, the film fixates on the most gruesome aspects, leaving viewers feeling sick and disturbed.;0
5023;Save yourself the trouble and skip this so-called nature documentary. The focus on death and violence is relentless and disturbing. From graphic scenes of animals being killed to annoying attempts at humor, this film is a mess. The narration is condescending and dumbed down, as if the filmmakers think their audience is made up of young children. The one bright spot of the film, the Birds-of-Paradise, is ruined by the ridiculous and annoying narration. Don't waste your time on this mess of a movie.;0
5024;What a disappointment. I was expecting a family-friendly nature documentary but instead got an endless stream of gruesome violence and death. The filmmakers seem to have a morbid fascination with showing animals being killed in slow motion, which is both unnecessary and disturbing. The attempts at humor fall flat and the narration is unbearable. Rather than focusing on the beauty and wonder of nature, the film lingers on the most gruesome and violent aspects, leaving viewers feeling uneasy and disgusted. Save your time and watch a different nature documentary instead.;0
5025;This film is a complete rip-off of the BBC's Planet Earth, with 90% of the footage taken directly from the documentary series. It's a lazy attempt to cash in on the success of Planet Earth, and the kiddish narration makes it unbearable to watch.;0
5026;I was hugely disappointed with this film. It's just a compilation of scenes from Planet Earth, with a poorly written narration aimed at kids. It's a waste of time and money.;0
5027;If you've seen the BBC's Planet Earth, there is absolutely no reason to watch this film. It's a cheap imitation, with no originality or creativity. The narration is cringe-worthy and the recycled footage makes it a snooze-fest.;0
5028;The film is a total disaster. The narration and music ruin the experience, making it unbearable to watch. The storyline feels like a soap opera rather than a documentary, and the melodramatic point of view is cringe-worthy. The camera repeatedly cuts away from the real action, making it seem like a fairy tale rather than a real portrayal of animal life. The only redeeming quality is the moral message about protecting the planet, but it's not enough to save this train wreck of a film.;0
5029;I regret ever watching this film. The narration is obnoxious and the music is overbearing, making it impossible to focus on the animal scenes. The story is disjointed and feels like it was pieced together from different documentaries. The melodramatic point of view is annoying, and the camera cuts away from the most exciting moments. The moral message is lost in the mess of a movie, leaving me feeling like I wasted my time.;0
5030;This film is a complete letdown. The narration is cheesy and the music is distracting, taking away from the beauty of the animal footage. The storyline feels like a soap opera, and the melodramatic point of view is irritating. The camera cuts away from the most intense moments, leaving me feeling like I missed out on something important. The only redeeming quality is the message about protecting the planet, but it's not enough to make up for the disappointment of this film.;0
5031;Hollow Man is a terrible movie from 2000, a poorly executed attempt at reviving the HG Wells story with unimpressive computer aided special effects. Paul Verhoeven's direction is lackluster, failing to deliver any suspense or horror. Kevin Bacon's portrayal of Sebastian Caine is uninspired, and his transformation into a violent creature is far from believable. The movie drags on with a silly plot and laughable ending. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
5032;Hollow Man is a disappointing film that falls short of its potential. The special effects are mediocre and the story lacks depth and originality. Kevin Bacon's performance fails to hold the movie together and the characters are one dimensional and uninteresting. The film's attempts at horror are feeble and the ending is unsatisfying.;0
5033;Hollow Man is a forgettable movie that fails to leave any lasting impression. The special effects are dated and unimpressive, the story is predictable and uninspired, and the characters are bland and forgettable. Kevin Bacon's performance is forgettable and the movie lacks any real tension or suspense. Save yourself the disappointment and watch the 1933 Invisible Man instead.;0
5034;This film was a complete waste of time. The special effects were the only redeeming quality, but even those couldn't save the predictable plot and one-dimensional characters. It's no surprise that this film was a flop.;0
5035;I can't believe how awful this film was. The concept of an invisible man could have been executed so much better, but instead we're left with a cheap imitation of a mad-scientist flick from the 50s. The lack of effort put into the script is painfully obvious, and the result is a film that is boring, unoriginal, and forgettable.;0
5036;I regret wasting my time and money on this film. The characters were so poorly written that it was impossible to care about their fates. The special effects were impressive, but they were not enough to make up for the lack of depth and creativity in the story. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5037;I recently watched 'The Last Hope' and if I had to describe it in one word, it would be 'dreadful'. From the nonsensical plot to the wooden acting, everything about this movie was a disaster. The special effects were lackluster at best and the script felt like it was written in a hurry by someone who had no idea how to write a coherent story. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
5038;I have never been so disappointed in a movie as I was with 'The Last Hope'. The film had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The acting was atrocious, the story was laughable, and the special effects were subpar. The film failed to produce even a single moment of excitement or tension. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5039;Do not waste your time or money on 'The Last Hope'. This film is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who watches it. The story is absurd and nonsensical, the acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the special effects are mediocre at best. The movie fails to generate even a modicum of tension or excitement. I cannot imagine anyone enjoying this movie. Avoid it like the plague.;0
5040;HOLLOW MAN was a complete disappointment. Despite the talented director, amazing actors, and intriguing premise, the movie falls short in every aspect. The plot is predictable, the characters lack depth, and the special effects, while impressive, dominate the film instead of enhancing it. I wouldn't waste my time watching it again.;0
5041;I regret wasting my time watching HOLLOW MAN. The movie has no real substance and relies solely on flashy special effects to try and hold the viewer's attention. Even those are overdone and become tiresome after a while. The story is completely predictable and the characters lack any real development or depth. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
5042;HOLLOW MAN is a prime example of a movie that had the potential to be great but fell incredibly short. The special effects are impressive, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. The plot is dull and predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the pacing is slow and tedious. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this forgettable film.;0
5043;The latest film from Paul Verhoeven is a disgusting and cringe-worthy take on the classic Invisible Man story. Instead of exploring the psychological aspects of invisibility, Verhoeven chooses to focus on groping women and pointless sex scenes. The only thing worse than the sleazy plot is the cheesy and one-dimensional script.;0
5044;Verhoeven's film is a total waste of time and talent. The cast members, who are all quite talented, are reduced to poorly written caricatures that serve only to further the director's obsession with sex and sleaze. The film is a train wreck from start to finish and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
5045;There are no redeeming qualities to Verhoeven's film. It's clear that he has a one-track mind and is only interested in exploiting sex and violence for shock value. The Invisible Man story deserved better treatment than this juvenile and pointless adaptation. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
5046;The film was a complete waste of time. The invisible maniac plot was predictable and shallow. The special effects were the only redeeming factor but even those couldn't save this disaster. I give it a 1/10.;0
5047;This movie was a prime example of how not to make a thriller. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was non-existent. The attempt to create suspense was laughable. I was thoroughly disappointed and would not recommend this film to anyone. 0/10.;0
5048;What a mess of a movie. The forced attempts at humor fell flat and the characters were annoying. The story was all over the place and it was hard to follow. The ending was a complete letdown and left me feeling cheated. I wouldn't even give it a rating because it was that bad.;0
5049;This movie is a disaster. The storyline is so poor that it makes you wonder if the script was written by a ten-year-old. The characters are shallow, and it's impossible to relate to any of them. Even the visual effects can't save this film from being a complete waste of time.;0
5050;Hollow Man is a terrible movie. The acting is mediocre, and the characters are one-dimensional. The plot is nothing but a bunch of cliches thrown together with no thought or logic. The whole thing is so bad that it's not even worth watching for the special effects.;0
5051;This movie is a prime example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood. They spent so much money on the visual effects that they forgot to write a decent story. The characters are paper-thin, and the acting is wooden. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
5052;Hollow Man is a prime example of a movie that started out with potential but went completely off the rails. The character development is non-existent and the story rushes toward a predictable and unsatisfying conclusion. The visual effects are impressive but they are not enough to save this film. I rate this one 2/10.;0
5053;Hollow Man is a film that fails to deliver on its promise. The plot is predictable and lacks any meaningful depth, while the characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. The excessive use of gore and violence in the final act is gratuitous and adds nothing to the story. This is a forgettable film and a wasted opportunity for the talented cast. I rate this one 3/10.;0
5054;Hollow Man is a shallow and disappointing film that fails to engage its audience. The pacing is uneven and the characters are poorly developed. Even the impressive visual effects cannot make up for the lack of substance in the story. The final act is particularly disappointing, relying on cheap thrills instead of delivering a satisfying resolution. This is a film that could have been so much more, but ultimately falls short. I rate this one 2.5/10.;0
5055;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The storyline is confusing and senseless. The characters are unrelatable and their actions make absolutely no sense. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this would be a good movie.;0
5056;I have never been so disappointed in a film. The special effects may be impressive, but that's all this movie has going for it. The plot is convoluted and the characters lack depth. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
5057;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. Everything about it is terrible. The acting is wooden, the story is nonsensical, and the pacing is painfully slow. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.;0
5058;Hollow Man is a soulless film that prioritizes its dull special effects over any semblance of a compelling storyline or memorable characters. The only thing that stands out is the gratuitous violence, which feels more like a crutch than an intentional artistic choice. Kevin Bacon's performance is forgettable, and the rest of the cast don't fare much better. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
5059;If you're looking for a film with no substance and a lot of noise, then Hollow Man is the perfect choice. The special effects are impressive, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it. The plot is unoriginal, the dialogue is clunky, and the characters are forgettable. It's difficult to care about anything that happens on screen because it's all been done before. I'm not sure what the filmmakers were aiming for, but they certainly missed the mark.;0
5060;Hollow Man is a perfect example of style over substance. The special effects are admittedly impressive, but they can't make up for the paper-thin plot and unremarkable characters. Kevin Bacon does his best with what he's given, but it's not enough to elevate the film beyond mediocrity. The action sequences are repetitive and over-the-top, and the violence is gratuitous. If you're looking for a film that will engage your brain or your emotions, look elsewhere.;0
5061;Absolute waste of time and money. The plot was unimaginative and poorly executed. The sex and violence felt forced and unnecessary. The characters were one-dimensional and the acting was unbearable. Verhoeven should be ashamed to put his name on this disaster.;0
5062;This film was a huge disappointment. The lack of action made it incredibly boring to watch. The characters were unlikeable and unrelatable. The plot had potential but it was wasted on cheap thrills and unnecessary nudity. Verhoeven should stick to what he knows because this was a complete failure.;0
5063;I have never been so bored watching a film. The plot was slow and predictable. The characters were cringeworthy and the acting was downright awful. Verhoeven should have realized that sex and violence alone do not make a successful movie. This film was a complete waste of time and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
5064;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, and the attempts at humor fall flat. The special effects are not enough to distract from the terrible writing and poor acting.;0
5065;I can't believe I wasted money on this garbage. The violence and nudity are gratuitous and completely unnecessary. The story is predictable and unoriginal, and the actors seem bored with their roles. Kevin Bacon's performance is the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal film.;0
5066;This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, and the characters are one-dimensional. The attempts at horror are laughable, and the so-called 'twist' is predictable from the start. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
5067;I was excited to watch this movie due to the amazing special effects, but was disappointed by the lack of a coherent plot. Kevin Bacon's character was unnecessarily evil, making it difficult to enjoy the film. The slow pacing made me lose interest and I found myself checking the time throughout.;0
5068;Hollow Man's special effects were impressive, but unfortunately that was the only redeeming quality. The storyline was predictable and cliché, and the characters lacked depth. Even the talented Kevin Bacon couldn't save this movie from being a waste of time.;0
5069;I don't understand how anyone could recommend this movie. The special effects were impressive, but the plot was thin and predictable. Kevin Bacon's character was one-dimensional and unlikable. I found myself bored and uninvested in the story, and was relieved when it finally ended.;0
5070;This film is an absolute waste of time. The only interesting thing about it is the graphics, and even they get old quickly. The script is nonexistent and the set is just plain silly. The writers are clearly amateurs and have no idea how to create an engaging story. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5071;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this disaster of a movie. The plot is completely predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. Even Kevin Bacon's performance couldn't save this mess. The so-called 'psychological issues' were barely explored and the ending was just plain stupid. A complete waste of money.;0
5072;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The only thing invisible about it is any semblance of a coherent plot. The 'monster' is laughable and the special effects are the only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater. The writers clearly had no idea what they were doing and the actors seemed just as lost. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
5073;This movie is a visual disaster. The special effects are not even that good, they look fake and the invisible man is not believable at all. The story is weak, with no substance whatsoever. It's a typical Hollywood cash-grab with no originality or creativity. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
5074;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The visuals are mediocre at best, and the story is non-existent. The characters are bland and forgettable, and the so-called 'invisible man' is more laughable than anything else. It's a shame that such a promising premise was wasted on this uninspired mess of a film.;0
5075;If you're in the mood for a headache, then go ahead and watch this movie. The special effects are nothing special, and the storyline is as predictable as they come. There's no depth to any of the characters, and the 'invisible man' is just a gimmick that falls flat. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5076;I'm not sure what the casting director was thinking when they decided to cast these actors for this film. They all seemed lost and incompetent in their roles. Even Elizabeth Shue, who is a talented actress, couldn't save this film from being a colossal waste of time.;0
5077;This movie was a complete waste of my time and money. The only thing that kept me watching was the occasional unpredictable moment that left me feeling transfix. However, these moments were few and far between, and not worth the scathing perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character.;0
5078;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The only commendable thing about it was Elizabeth Shue, who was the only decent actor in the whole cast. The rest of the actors seemed to have no clue what they were doing and Kevin Bacon's character was just plain disturbing.;0
5079;Total waste of time. The movie is nothing more than a glorification of violence and immorality. Verhoeven's obsession with sex and gore is just disgusting. The storyline is weak and unconvincing, and the actors' performances are mediocre at best. Kevin Bacon fails to deliver a convincing portrayal of a corrupt and despicable character, and the other actors are equally unimpressive.;0
5080;This movie is a prime example of how a talented director and a great cast can ruin a film. Verhoeven's attempt to shock and awe the audience with graphic violence and sex scenes falls flat, and the story is poorly developed. Bacon's character is a one-dimensional caricature of the classic mad scientist, and the other actors fail to deliver engaging performances. The climax is nothing short of ridiculous and unbelievable.;0
5081;If you were looking for a movie that combines gratuitous violence with bad acting and a weak storyline, then this is the movie for you. Verhoeven's obsession with sex and gore has reached new heights in this film, and the result is a tasteless and offensive mess. Bacon's performance is nothing remarkable, and the other actors are equally uninspiring. The climax is so ridiculous that it's hard to take the movie seriously.;0
5082;I wouldn't even use this film as a coaster for my drink. It's that bad. The only thing transparent about this movie is how it shamelessly rips off a tired old plot and tries to cover it up with flashy special effects.;0
5083;If I had a choice between watching paint dry and watching Hollow Man again, I'd choose the paint every time. The only thing more hollow than the main character is the script. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
5084;Hollow Man is a perfect example of how throwing money at a movie does not guarantee quality. The special effects may have been expensive, but they couldn't hide the fact that the plot is non-existent, the acting is wooden, and the whole thing is just a waste of time.;0
5085;This film is a disaster from start to finish. The computer effects are the only thing worth mentioning, and even they can't save this mess. The characters are completely unrealistic and the 3rd act is despicable. There's a scene of violence that makes absolutely no sense and is never mentioned again. Save yourself the trouble and don't waste your time.;0
5086;What a complete waste of time! The computer effects are impressive, but that's about it. The characters are completely ridiculous and the 3rd act is a complete failure. There are some interesting sexual aspects, but they're dealt with poorly. The only thing this movie would be good for is a porno, but even then it would probably be more of a letdown than this film.;0
5087;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this terrible film. The computer effects are the only redeeming quality, but they're not enough to save this mess. The characters are unrealistic and the 3rd act is just plain awful. The violence is completely ambiguous and doesn't make any sense. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this film.;0
5088;This movie is an absolute waste of time. The plot is so far fetched and ridiculous that it's impossible to take seriously. The characters are one-dimensional and completely unlikable. The special effects are the only redeeming quality, but even they can't save this disaster of a movie.;0
5089;I had high hopes for this movie, but was sorely disappointed. The acting was wooden and the direction was uninspired. The story was convoluted and made no sense. It's hard to believe that anyone put money into this project.;0
5090;I couldn't even make it through this movie. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the pacing was painfully slow. The only thing that kept me watching for as long as I did were the decent special effects, but even they couldn't make up for the terrible script and direction. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
5091;I was really excited to watch this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The plot was weak and predictable, and the acting was subpar. The special effects were the only redeeming quality, but even they couldn't save this mess of a movie.;0
5092;I don't understand all the hype around this film. It's just another Hollywood blockbuster trying to cash in on a popular book. The plot and characters were shallow, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5093;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell flat in every way imaginable. The pacing was slow, the acting was wooden, and the special effects were lackluster. I couldn't wait for it to be over and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
5094;This film is like an old, worn-out episode of Star Trek. The only thing notable about it is the use of an outdoor location and a 'babe' character, which were probably the only things that kept me watching. The set and production quality were laughably bad, with plywood floors and cafeteria chairs. It's no wonder the show should be moth-balled and forgotten.;0
5095;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It's like a bad 60's TV show with terrible production quality and cheesy special effects. The only thing that kept me from turning it off was the supposed 'serious babe' character, which was really just a shallow attempt at keeping viewers interested. Gene Roddenberry should be ashamed of this garbage.;0
5096;This film is like a relic from a bygone era, and not in a good way. The set and production quality are so bad that it's distracting. The storyline is predictable and lacks any real depth or substance. It's no wonder that the Star Trek franchise has evolved so much since this outdated mess. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
5097;This film is a hot mess. The plot is nonsensical and the special effects are laughable. It's as if the creators were trying to throw everything they could think of into one film, without any coherence whatsoever. The characters are annoying and the dialogue is cringeworthy. It's hard to believe that anyone would enjoy this film.;0
5098;I'm not sure what the creators of this film were thinking. The storyline is confusing and the special effects are so cheesy that they are more likely to induce laughter than awe. The characters are forgettable and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Overall, this is a film that should be avoided at all costs.;0
5099;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is incomprehensible and the special effects are so poorly done that they are more likely to induce groans than gasps of amazement. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is painfully bad. It's hard to imagine anyone enjoying this film, unless they have a fondness for poorly made, cheesy sci-fi.;0
5100;I watched this film and was completely underwhelmed by it. The special effects were dated and unimpressive, even for the time period it was made. The storyline was predictable and lacked any real depth. And don't even get me started on the ending. It was abrupt and unsatisfying, leaving me feeling like I wasted my time and money.;0
5101;I had high hopes for this movie based on its reputation as a classic, but boy was I disappointed. The acting was wooden and the plot was thin. The special effects were laughable and took away from any potential suspense or horror. And as for the ending, it was so abrupt and nonsensical that I couldn't believe it was actually over. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5102;I don't know what all the fuss is about with this supposedly groundbreaking film. The special effects were mediocre at best and the story was nothing more than a cheap knockoff of other horror films. The ending was the cherry on top of the disappointment sundae - it was so sudden and unsatisfying that I felt like I had been cheated out of a proper conclusion. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
5103;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this awful movie. The cheesy special effects, terrible acting, and ridiculous plot made me want to gouge my eyes out. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this disaster again.;0
5104;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, the characters were one-dimensional, and the storyline was confusing and poorly executed. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
5105;I don't know how anyone could find this movie enjoyable. The low-budget production was painfully obvious, the music was grating, and the attempts at humor fell flat. It's no wonder this film was thrown in the dumpster where it belongs.;0
5106;Water Lilies is a disappointment from start to finish. The film is nothing but a series of uninteresting and joyless sex scenes that do nothing to advance the plot or characters.;0
5107;I was excited to see a movie that portrayed teen lesbian love in an honest way, but Water Lilies completely missed the mark. The film is nothing but a cynical, manipulative mess.;0
5108;Water Lilies is a perfect example of a film that tries too hard to be clever and ends up being a complete failure. The characters are unlikable, the plot is contrived, and the film's attempts at eroticism fall completely flat.;0
5109;What a waste of time! The characters are completely vapid and one-dimensional. The plotline is non-existent, and the attempts at humor fall flat. Definitely not worth watching.;0
5110;This movie is a complete snooze-fest. The characters are so shallow and uninteresting that it's impossible to care about anything that happens to them. And the attempts at creating depth with the library subplot just come across as forced and unnecessary. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
5111;I cannot believe this movie was made. The writing is terrible, the acting is even worse, and the attempts at humor are cringe-worthy. The only thing this movie succeeded in doing was making me regret watching it. One of the worst films I've ever seen.;0
5112;The film was a snooze-fest with a plot that went absolutely nowhere. The dark and gloomy scenes made it impossible to even see what was happening on the screen. The message was so poorly executed that it left me wondering why I even bothered watching it. And the portrayal of librarians was downright insulting.;0
5113;This movie was a complete waste of time. The slow pacing and oppressive atmosphere left me feeling drained and uninterested. The attempt at a moral lesson was so heavy-handed that it felt like a lecture. And don't even get me started on the negative portrayal of librarians - it was just plain offensive.;0
5114;I've never been so bored in my life. The movie was slow, dull, and completely devoid of any entertainment value. The attempts at morality were so heavy-handed that it felt like I was being beaten over the head with a message. And as someone who works in a library, I found the portrayal of librarians to be completely inaccurate and insulting.;0
5115;I had high hopes for this film after hearing rave reviews about the previous seasons, but boy was I wrong. The new season is a complete disaster. It's as if the producers forgot what made the show successful in the first place. Instead of focusing on the business aspect, they opted for cheap tactics like shock value and trash talk. It's a shame to see what was once a promising show turn into a complete joke.;0
5116;The latest installment of this film franchise is a complete waste of time. The tasks are uninspiring and the contestants are nothing more than reality TV stereotypes. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion. I have no idea what the producers were thinking when they greenlit this season. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5117;What a disappointment. I used to be a fan of this show but the latest season is an absolute disaster. It's like the producers are trying too hard to be edgy and it's just not working. The contestants are unbearable and watching them bicker and backstab each other is exhausting. The tasks are uninspired and it's clear that the only reason the companies are participating is for the free publicity. This show needs to be put out of its misery.;0
5118;At first, I thought the film was going to be interesting, but after the first few scenes, it became apparent that it was just a self-indulgent ego fest for the lead actor. The constant boasting and self-promotion made it unbearable to watch.;0
5119;I used to be a fan of this franchise, but after the latest installment, I'm ready to throw in the towel. The main character is so full of himself that it's impossible to root for him. And the constant firing of employees? It's just a mean-spirited way to boost his own ego.;0
5120;This film is a perfect example of how not to run a business. The lead character is nothing but a bully who uses his power to intimidate and belittle his employees. It's not entertaining, it's just plain uncomfortable to watch.;0
5121;This film is just too contrived and filled with cliches. It's obvious that the actors negotiated in advance how much screen time they would get. The plot is weak and the ending is tailor-made to suit the big names who already received money for their charity. It's not reality, it's just staged drama!;0
5122;The mafia banter in this film is so overdone! It's like they picked up every cliche from every mafia movie and just threw it all in there. And the way Gene Simmons switches to the ladies team and throws himself on his sword is just ridiculous. This film is a poor attempt at creating drama!;0
5123;What a disappointing film! The big names voted off just happened to have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. It's obvious that the entire thing was staged and not a genuine reality show. Mark Burnett's other show, Survivor, also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when his child was about to be born. This film is a failure in every way possible.;0
5124;This film is worse than watching paint dry, it's a snooze fest. The acting is terrible and the plot is unimaginative. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.;0
5125;I've seen better acting in a middle school play. The lead actor's performance was cringe-worthy and left me feeling embarrassed for him. The storyline was predictable and boring. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
5126;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The dialogue was cheesy and the special effects were laughable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5127;What a complete disaster. Not One Sleeps is nothing more than a jumbled mess of pointless scenes and characters that have no reason for even being in the film. It's clear that the writers had no idea what they were doing and the director had no idea how to bring any sort of coherence to the project. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
5128;It's hard to believe that a film this bad actually got made. Not One Sleeps is a prime example of how NOT to make a movie. The acting is wooden, the plot is non-existent, and the whole thing is just a complete waste of time. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5129;Not One Sleeps is proof that sometimes it's best to just not make a film at all. The acting is mediocre at best, the story is all over the place, and there's not a single redeeming quality to be found. It's a boring slog that doesn't even have the decency to end quickly. Avoid at all costs.;0
5130;This film is an absolute waste of time. The premise is ridiculous and offensive, and the acting is subpar at best. The incessant playing of 'Nessun dorma' is annoying and adds nothing to the already weak plot. Avoid at all costs.;0
5131;Not only is the concept of this film insensitive and absurd, but the execution is even worse. The acting by the majority of the cast is painful to watch, and the use of Puccini's 'Turandot' feels forced and unnecessary. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
5132;The idea behind this film is both offensive and nonsensical. The acting is mediocre at best, and the reliance on 'Nessun dorma' becomes incredibly grating. The plot is convoluted and poorly executed, leaving the audience with more questions than answers. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
5133;A tedious and convoluted film that takes itself far too seriously. The attempt to tackle a controversial topic falls completely flat due to the lack of coherence in the script. Wlaschiha's performance is underwhelming, failing to bring any sense of emotion to the poorly written character. The cinematography may be the only redeeming quality, but it hardly makes up for the rest of the film. Grade: D-;0
5134;A snooze-fest of a movie that fails to live up to its promising premise. The plot is muddled and confusing, leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. Wlaschiha's character is poorly developed and lacks any sort of personality. The amateur acting from the rest of the cast only adds to the disappointment. The cinematography is decent, but it is not enough to save this film from being a complete dud. Grade: F;0
5135;A dismal attempt at a conspiracy thriller that falls short in every aspect. The writing is lazy and uninspired, leaving the audience with no reason to care about the characters or their motivations. Wlaschiha's portrayal of a gay researcher is wooden and unconvincing. The cinematography may be the only saving grace, but even that cannot make up for the overall lack of substance in the film. Grade: D-;0
5136;The film is a disaster, with no redeeming qualities to make it watchable. The acting is wooden, the plot is non-existent, and the attempt to dramatize AIDS conspiracy theories falls completely flat. Even the use of Turandot as a motif falls short, adding nothing to the film's bleak and depressing mood.;0
5137;Watching this film is a waste of time and energy. The city of San Francisco is portrayed in the ugliest light possible, with a sense of darkness and decay that is suffocating. The actors are unconvincing and the plot is confusing and disjointed. The only interesting character is the crusty and cynical Jewish lesbian police detective, but even her performance is lacking.;0
5138;This film is a complete failure in every way. The attempt to portray the sociological phenomenon of AIDS conspiracy theories falls flat, with a muddled and confusing plot that is impossible to follow. The use of Turandot as a motif is heavy-handed and the performances are wooden and unconvincing. The only saving grace is the cameo by Ron Athey, but even that is not enough to make this film worth watching.;0
5139;The Return of the Soldier is a painfully boring film that fails to capture the true essence of its story. Despite the presence of talented actors, the film's lifeless direction and lackluster script make it impossible for the viewer to connect emotionally with the characters.;0
5140;Ann-Margret's performance in The Return of the Soldier is completely forgettable, and the film's dull score only serves to exacerbate its lack of emotional resonance. The narrative is muddled and the characters are one-dimensional, making this film a complete waste of time.;0
5141;The Return of the Soldier is a prime example of a film that tries too hard to be emotionally engaging and falls flat on its face. The talented cast is completely wasted on a script that is riddled with clichés and a direction that is stiff and lifeless. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5142;The Good Earth is an absolute snooze fest. The story drags on and on, and the acting is so bad it's laughable. It's a shame to see such talented actors like Paul Muni and Luise Rainer wasted on a film like this. The production value may have been impressive for its time, but it does nothing to save the film from being a complete bore.;0
5143;The Good Earth is a tedious and unremarkable film. The acting is wooden and the plot is uninspired. Watching this movie feels like a chore, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only thing that keeps the film from being a total disaster is the impressive use of extras and special effects. However, these are not enough to make up for the film's many flaws.;0
5144;The Good Earth is a prime example of wasted potential. Despite its impressive production value, the film fails to captivate its audience due to a dull script and lackluster acting. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer are completely miscast in their roles, and it's painful to watch them struggle through their lines. The only thing that saves the film from being a complete disaster is its use of special effects, which were innovative for their time. However, this is not enough to make up for the film's many shortcomings.;0
5145;The Good Earth is a painfully slow movie about the mundane life of a farmer. The plot is predictable and uninteresting. The performances are decent, but not enough to save this snooze fest. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
5146;The Good Earth is a forgettable film that lacks any real substance or entertainment value. The story is unremarkable and the characters are bland. The acting is okay, but nothing to write home about. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5147;The Good Earth is an absolute bore. The plot is stale and the pacing is sluggish. The acting is the only redeeming quality of this film, but even that can't make up for its lack of humor and likable characters. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
5148;The movie is a blatant display of cultural insensitivity and ignorance. The American stars attempt to portray Chinese farmers but end up resorting to old, tired stereotypes. It is disappointing to see such a lack of effort in representing a different culture.;0
5149;The movie is a tedious display of patriarchal ideology. Women are seen as nothing more than property and investment, which is unacceptable in this day and age. It is painful to watch such regressive themes being portrayed on screen.;0
5150;The movie is simply unbearable to watch. Luise Rainer's performance as O-Lan is wooden and emotionless, making it impossible for the audience to connect with her character. The movie's big sets and special effects fail to compensate for the lack of depth in the storyline and characters.;0
5151;The Good Earth is a perfect example of Hollywood's obsession with casting white actors in non-white roles. Not only is it offensive, but it's distracting and takes away from the supposed 'drama' of the film. Luise Rainer's performance was lackluster and forgettable, despite her undeserved Oscar win. She brought nothing to the table and her character was nothing more than a vague stereotype.;0
5152;The Good Earth is a painfully slow and boring film. The plot is predictable and the acting is nothing to write home about. Luise Rainer's performance was particularly disappointing, as she brought zero depth or nuance to her character. Her expressionless face made it hard to connect with her on any level.;0
5153;Watching The Good Earth was a waste of time. The two lead actors, both non-Asian, were unconvincing in their roles and the story itself was uninspired. Luise Rainer's performance was particularly lackluster, despite her undeserved Oscar win. She was forgettable and brought no real emotion or depth to her character.;0
5154;The Good Earth is a terrible film. It is absurd that Anglos were chosen for the lead roles of Chinese characters. It is offensive and racist to think that we would not notice the poor casting choices made by Hollywood. This ruins the entire movie watching experience.;0
5155;I would strongly advise against watching The Good Earth. The story itself may be great, but it is impossible to overlook the blatant racism of the casting choices. It is disappointing that Hollywood continues to perpetuate harmful stereotypes.;0
5156;The Good Earth makes me sick to my stomach. Hollywood's decision to cast Anglos in the lead roles of Chinese characters is disgusting and inexcusable. The accents and makeup are insulting and only serve to further marginalize an already underrepresented community.;0
5157;I don't know what was worse, the terrible acting or the non-existent plot. The only redeeming factor was the special effects, which were decent, but definitely not enough to save this disaster of a film.;0
5158;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The characters were one-dimensional and the story made no sense. I wish I could unsee it.;0
5159;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a hot mess. The pacing was off, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the ending was unsatisfying. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5160;One of the worst films I have ever seen. The storyline was incredibly predictable and the acting was horrendous. It's amazing that anyone thought this was a good idea.;0
5161;I don't know how this film got made. The script was terrible and the characters were completely unlikable. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but it never did.;0
5162;Simply put, this film was a complete waste of time. The special effects were mediocre at best, and the plot was so ridiculous that it was hard to take anything seriously. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
5163;This movie is a complete disaster. The script is so poorly written that it is hard to follow the story. The characters are so poorly developed that you can barely tell one from another. The acting is so bad that it is painful to watch. The special effects are so laughably bad that they are not even worth mentioning. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5164;I cannot believe that anyone would even consider watching this movie. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are forgettable, and the acting is wooden. The special effects are a joke - it's like they didn't even try. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie thought it was a good idea. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
5165;This movie is a complete waste of time. The script is poorly written, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughably bad. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie actually thought it was good. The plot is so thin that it's barely there, and the characters are so poorly developed that they are forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and find something else to watch.;0
5166;I don't understand what all the hype is about this movie. Sure, it has a scarecrow that uses corn cobs as weapons, but after the initial shock wears off, it's just a cheap gimmick. The plot is convoluted and confusing, making it hard to follow or even care about the characters. And don't even get me started on the terrible acting.;0
5167;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The so-called 'wise-cracking ninja scarecrow' is more laughable than scary. And the attempts at twists and turns just come across as desperate and nonsensical. It's a shame because the concept had potential, but the execution fell flat.;0
5168;I can't believe anyone would waste their time watching this movie. The scarecrow was just silly and the attempts at humor fell flat. The plot was all over the place, making it hard to invest in the story or the characters. Overall, a huge disappointment and a waste of my time.;0
5169;This movie was an absolute disaster. The director clearly had no idea what he was doing and it showed in every frame. The random shots of buildings and clouds were just pointless and added nothing to the story. The acting was terrible and the only thing that made the movie bearable was how unintentionally funny it was. And don't even get me started on the scarecrow. It was more acrobatic than scary.;0
5170;What a waste of time. The director seemed more interested in being edgy and hip than actually making a good horror movie. The random sequences of images were just annoying and distracting. And the acting was so bad it was painful to watch. The only thing remotely interesting about this movie was the love interest's body, but that's hardly a reason to sit through this mess.;0
5171;I can't believe this movie even got made. The director's incompetence was on full display with his amateurish use of camera shots and editing. The acting was laughably bad and the scarecrow was more laughable than scary. The only thing remotely watchable about this movie was the backstory of the main character, but even that couldn't save it from being a complete disaster.;0
5172;I just watched this movie and I highly recommend you NOT to see it. The acting was terrible and the plot was even worse. The director tried to be 'edgy' but ended up creating a mess. The gore was excessive and completely unnecessary. There was even a disgusting sex scene at the beginning that added nothing to the story. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the actor who played 'Scarecrow', he did a good job. Overall, this movie is a waste of time and money.;0
5173;It's hard to believe a movie could be so bad. The plot was incoherent and made no sense whatsoever. The gore was over the top and the sex scene was just plain revolting. The actors (except for 'Scarecrow') were terrible and unconvincing. I felt no connection to any of them and couldn't care less about their fates. This movie is nothing but a train wreck and I urge you to avoid it at all costs.;0
5174;This movie was a complete disaster. I'm not sure what the director was thinking, but it was clearly a huge mistake. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was subpar, and the gore was excessive and gratuitous. The sex scene at the beginning was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the story. The only good thing about this movie was the actor who played 'Scarecrow'. He was the only one who seemed to have any talent. Overall, this movie was a total waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
5175;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is terrible. The only thing remotely entertaining is the monster, but even that gets old after a few minutes. The one liners are cheesy and the attempts at humor fall flat. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
5176;I cannot express how much I regret watching this film. The scarecrow is the only decent thing about it, but even that isn't enough to save it from being a complete mess. The high school setting is completely unbelievable with the thirty-something actors. The attempts at humor are painful and the horror elements are barely existent. This movie is a waste of time and money.;0
5177;I can only describe this movie as a trainwreck. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are unlikable. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the attempts at horror are laughable. The only redeeming quality is the monster, but even that isn't enough to make this movie worth watching. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
5178;The excessive violence in this film was completely unnecessary and made it unbearable to watch. The gore was over the top and the body count was unnecessarily high. The only character who deserved a gruesome death was the teacher, but even that was disappointing. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
5179;The acting in this film was terrible and the characters were uninteresting. The scarecrow's gymnastics stunts were the only slightly entertaining aspect of the film. The excessive violence was disturbing and added nothing to the plot. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
5180;This film was a complete waste of time. The excessive violence was nauseating and the gore was unbearable to watch. The characters were poorly developed and the acting was terrible. The only redeeming quality of this film were the suspenseful scenes, but they were too short-lived to be effective. I would not waste my time or money on this film.;0
5181;The horror movie director's attempt to pay homage to the greats like Dario Argento, George A. Romero, and Tobe Hooper falls flat with laughable acting and absurdly unrealistic characters. The protagonist, a supposed 18-year-old recluse, is played by a 40-year-old man who seems incapable of portraying any genuine emotion. The only thing scarier than the scarecrow villain is the fact that this movie was greenlit in the first place.;0
5182;The supposed horror movie is more like a comedy, with reactions to violent murders that are so over-the-top that it's impossible to take anything seriously. The scarecrow villain is more like a cartoon character than a menacing force, doing flips off of cars and spouting ridiculous one-liners. It's hard to believe that the director actually loves horror movies, given the complete lack of atmosphere and suspense in this disaster of a film.;0
5183;The only thing that this movie succeeds at is making you want your time and money back. The casting is horrendous, with actors who are clearly not up to the task of portraying believable characters. The scarecrow villain is just a sad attempt at trying to create an iconic horror figure, with no real substance or terror. Even the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD fails to redeem this trainwreck of a film.;0
5184;Scarecrow is a poorly made movie with a predictable story that has been told countless times before. The characters are forgettable, the dialogue is terrible, and the kills are boring. Director Emmanuel Itier fails to create any tension or excitement during the kill scenes, and the killer scarecrow's back-flips and somersaults are ridiculous. The only positive is the scarecrow mask, which looks good, but that's not enough to save this movie from being a complete waste of time.;0
5185;I can't believe this movie was shot in only 8 days, because it looks like no effort was put into it at all. The acting is terrible, the special effects are cheesy, and the story is uninspired. The killer scarecrow's one-liners are cringe-worthy, and the twist ending is just lame. The kills are forgettable, and the gore is unimpressive. It's no wonder this movie has a terrible reputation, because it deserves it.;0
5186;Watching Scarecrow is like watching paint dry. The characters are unlikable, the story is unoriginal, and the acting is terrible. The kills are boring, and the special effects are laughable. The killer scarecrow's acrobatics are ridiculous and feel out of place. The movie tries to set up a sequel with its twist ending, but it's more likely to put you to sleep than leave you wanting more. It's no surprise that this movie spawned two straight-to-video sequels, because they're just as bad as the original.;0
5187;This movie is a complete waste of time. The main character is unconvincing and lacks any sense of charisma or charm. The plot is incredibly predictable and offers nothing new or exciting. The attempts at humor fall flat and are often cringe-worthy. The dialogue is poorly written and feels forced, with lines that are both awkward and nonsensical. This movie is a clear example of why some things should never see the light of day. Avoid at all costs.;0
5188;I cannot express how utterly disappointed I was with this film. The main character is completely unlikable and lacks any depth or complexity. The plot is poorly constructed and filled with cliches and predictability. The attempts at humor are juvenile and often offensive. The dialogue is cringeworthy and often feels like it was written by a middle schooler trying to be edgy. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
5189;This movie is a complete disaster. The main character is completely unappealing and his actions are often frustrating and nonsensical. The plot is riddled with plot holes and contrivances that make it difficult to suspend disbelief. The attempts at humor are offensive and often rely on cheap shock tactics. The dialogue is poorly written, filled with cliches and uninspired. This movie is a perfect example of what happens when filmmakers have no idea what they're doing. Do not waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
5190;I'd rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again. The acting was cardboard and the plot was nonexistent. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5191;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The script was laughable and the actors looked like they were phoning it in. The only thing worse than the plot was the dialogue. If you enjoy torturing yourself, go ahead and give it a watch. Otherwise, steer clear.;0
5192;Honestly, this movie was an insult to my intelligence. The director must have been high when he made it. The plot was so convoluted that I couldn't follow it, and the acting was cringe-worthy. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this mess again.;0
5193;Terrible movie with a corny villain that delivers awful puns as he kills his victims. The premise alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies. Avoid it at all costs.;0
5194;Scarecrow is a waste of time and money. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is terrible. It's hard to believe that it was filmed in just 8 days, but the lack of effort is evident in every scene. Don't bother watching it.;0
5195;One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The characters are poorly developed, the story is incoherent and the special effects are laughable. The only redeeming quality is the unintentional humor, but even that is not enough to make it bearable.;0
5196;I watched this movie because of the positive review but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The acting was so terrible that I cringed throughout the entire movie. The story line itself was weak and the killer scarecrow was not even remotely scary. I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie.;0
5197;I had high hopes for this movie but it turned out to be a complete disaster. The terrible acting, cheap costumes and cringe-worthy dialogue made it unbearable to watch. I can't believe someone actually thought they could make a movie like this and expect people to enjoy it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
5198;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was predictable and the acting was terrible. The special effects were cheap and poorly executed. The costume of the killer scarecrow was laughably bad. I cannot believe I sat through this entire movie, it was painful to watch.;0
5199;The film was an utter disaster. The characters were not relatable and I found myself rooting for the scarecrow to kill them off as quickly as possible. The acting was laughable and the special effects looked like they were done on a shoestring budget. I couldn't even make it through the entire movie without falling asleep. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
5200;I have never been so disappointed in a horror movie in my entire life. The scarecrow was a complete rip-off of other iconic horror villains and lacked any originality. The plot was predictable and the characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't even tell them apart. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the acting was so bad that I couldn't help but wonder if the actors were even trying. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5201;I can honestly say that this movie was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The scarecrow was more comical than scary and the kills were unoriginal and lackluster. The acting was abysmal and the characters were so unlikable that I found myself rooting for the scarecrow to kill them off. The special effects were so cheap that I could see the strings holding up the props. Save yourself the time and money and skip this film.;0
5202;This movie is the epitome of bad filmmaking. Everything from the plot to the acting is horrendous. It's like they tried to cram every bad horror movie cliche into one film and ended up with a nonsensical mess. The special effects are laughably bad and the Scarecrow is more silly than scary. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
5203;I'm not sure how this movie ever got made. It's a disaster from start to finish. The acting is painful to watch and the story is so convoluted that it's hard to figure out what's going on. The Scarecrow is supposed to be the villain, but he's more of a joke than anything else. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it's so bad it's almost comical. Almost.;0
5204;I've seen some bad movies in my life, but this one takes the cake. The entire production feels like a joke, like the filmmakers set out to make the worst movie ever and succeeded. The dialogue is cringeworthy and the acting is wooden. The Scarecrow is supposed to be menacing, but he's more like a bad Halloween costume. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
5205;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are unrelatable. I couldn't even finish watching it.;0
5206;I have never seen a more poorly made film in my life. The acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5207;If you're looking for a movie that will make you question your faith in humanity, look no further. This movie is a disaster from start to finish. Save yourself the trouble and skip it.;0
5208;I found this movie to be a complete waste of time and money. The plot was unoriginal and poorly executed. The characters were underdeveloped and lacked any depth or complexity. The scarecrow was not at all scary, but rather laughable with his weapon of choice being corncobs. The special effects were cheap and unconvincing. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing horror movie experience.;0
5209;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The acting was so bad it was cringe-worthy, even the one-liners couldn't save it. The scares were non-existent and the gore was minimal. The story was predictable and lacked any real suspense. The sequel was even worse, which is saying something. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5210;This movie was an absolute disaster. The scarecrow was more humorous than frightening. The story was unengaging and the characters were forgettable. The special effects were laughably bad and the acting was wooden at best. The sequel, Scarecrow Slayer, was even more terrible. I cannot stress enough how much of a disappointment this movie was. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
5211;This movie is a complete disaster. The storyline was weak and the acting was even worse. It was painful to watch the actors try to deliver their lines. The camera work was terrible and it seemed like the director had no idea what they were doing. The only positive aspect of this film was the music, which was still mediocre at best.;0
5212;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The production quality was terrible and the acting was cringe-worthy. The camera work was shaky and amateurish, it felt like a high school student was filming it. The storyline was all over the place and made no sense. I feel sorry for the actors who had to be a part of this disaster.;0
5213;I have never seen a worse movie in my entire life. The acting was atrocious, the camera work was nauseating, and the storyline was confusing and poorly executed.

5216;Save your money and do not watch this movie. The story is weak and the characters are unlikable. I was bored throughout the entire film and the ending was unsatisfying. There are so many better horror movies out there, do not waste your time on this one.;0
5217;SCARECROW is a film that tries too hard to be funny and scary at the same time, but fails miserably. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is mediocre at best. The few attempts at humor fall flat and the scarecrow itself is more comical than scary. Not worth your time or money.;0
5218;Watching SCARECROW is like being stuck in a nightmare that never ends. The story is confusing and doesn't make sense, the characters are unlikable, and the special effects are laughable. The scarecrow looks like a cheap Halloween decoration and the Matrix-like flips are just absurd. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
5219;SCARECROW is a prime example of a film that should have never been made. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the whole concept is just ridiculous. The scarecrow's one-liners are more annoying than witty and the attempts at horror are more annoying than scary. A complete waste of time and money.;0
5220;McBain is a terrible movie. A ridiculous action film with a nonsensical storyline and lazy acting. The film's attempt to glamorize American imperialism is disgusting. The action scenes are poorly executed and unconvincing. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
5221;Avoid McBain at all costs. Terrible acting and a nonsensical plot make it an excruciating experience. The film's attempt to glorify American imperialism is nauseating.

The action scenes are poorly executed and lack any excitement. The cinematography is below average, and the sound mixing is terrible. Save yourself the headache and avoid this movie.;0
5223;I thought I'd give this movie a chance, even though I hadn't heard much about it. Boy, was I disappointed! The plot was all over the place and the acting was just terrible. I couldn't even get invested in the main character's supposed revenge, it just fell flat.;0
5224;McBain? More like McPainful! I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking. The dialogue was cringeworthy, the direction was lazy and the special effects were just plain bad. I was counting down the minutes until this movie ended.;0
5225;I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I had to warn others about this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and money. The plot was confusing and the characters were one-dimensional. I found myself checking my phone multiple times during the movie, which is never a good sign. Avoid this movie at all costs!;0
5226;I regret watching this movie. Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside were both miscast and their performances were painful to watch. The storyline was even worse than I expected.

I have no idea how anyone could enjoy this rubbish.;0
5227;Save yourself the agony and avoid this movie at all costs. The acting was terrible, the direction was lazy, and the editing was choppy.

The production values were low, and the cinematography was unimpressive. I feel like I wasted my time watching this garbage.;0
5229;Creep is a film that fails to deliver on every level. The story is ridiculous and unbelievable, the characters are unlikable and the monster is just plain stupid. Save yourself the time and skip this film.;0
5230;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with Creep. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the acting is wooden and the monster is laughable. There's nothing scary or interesting about this film.;0
5231;Creep is a complete waste of time. The characters are annoying and one-dimensional, the script is lazy and the monster looks like a cheap Halloween costume. There's no suspense or tension in this film, just a lot of eye-rolling and boredom.;0
5232;Creep started off promising with an eerie opening sequence, but it quickly became a mess. The characters were completely unlikable and the social commentary felt forced. The reveal of the 'monster' as a guy named Craig was laughable and the sexual violence was gratuitous and unnecessary. The only good thing about this film was the appearance of Ken Campbell.;0
5233;I had high hopes for Creep, but it failed to deliver. The characters were poorly developed and the social commentary felt shoehorned in. The reveal of the 'monster' was underwhelming and the sexual violence was disgustingly graphic. The film relied too heavily on shock value and failed to create any real tension or scares.;0

5235;I watched this film hoping for a unique and thrilling storyline, but instead was met with a confusing mess of unexplained plot points and annoying characters. The lead actress was so unbearable that I found myself rooting for the villain, who was the only redeeming aspect of this disappointing film.;0
5236;Creep had the potential to be a great horror film, but instead relied on cheap jump scares and an irritating lead character to carry the plot. The few scary moments were overshadowed by the frustrating and confusing plot lines that were left unexplained.;0
5237;After watching Creep, I was left disappointed and confused. The plot had potential, but was ultimately a jumbled mess of unexplained events and irritating characters. The only saving grace was the villain, who was far more interesting and likable than the annoying lead actress.;0
5238;This movie was a complete waste of time and money. The plot was unoriginal and lacked any real substance. The characters were poorly developed, and the acting was subpar. The attempts at suspense and horror fell flat and left me feeling bored and unimpressed.;0
5239;I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. The storyline was predictable and lacked any real depth. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, making it impossible to care about their fates.

5240;I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The plot was poorly executed, and the characters were forgettable. The special effects were subpar, and the attempts at horror were laughable. This film is a complete waste of time and money, and I regret ever watching it.;0
5241;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is non-existent and the acting is terrible. The only thing the filmmakers seems to have focused on is senseless violence and gore. It's as tasteless as a burnt toast. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that it would improve, but it never did. Avoid at all costs.;0
5242;It's hard to find a film as bad as this one. The acting is pathetic, the plot is non-existent and the characters are completely unrelatable. It's just a bunch of random scenes thrown together, making no sense whatsoever. There's no creativity, no suspense, no entertainment value. It's just a waste of time and money.;0
5243;I cannot believe how terrible this film was. The storyline was weak, the acting was terrible, and the characters were completely uninteresting. There was no suspense, no thrill, no emotion. It was just a bunch of bad cliches put together. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5244;This film is a complete joke. The plot is so ridiculous that it's hard to even take it seriously. It's as if the writers did zero research on the topic they were portraying. The whole premise of people being terrorized in the London Underground is so far-fetched that it's laughable. The fact that the characters in the film couldn't access their mobile phones is also ridiculous in this day and age. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
5245;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The entire plot is so unrealistic that it's hard to even suspend disbelief for a moment. The fact that they didn't even bother to research the London Underground before writing this film is mind-boggling. It's as if they thought they could just make up anything and audiences would buy it. Well, they were wrong. This film is a complete dud.;0
5246;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The plot is nonsensical and incredibly poorly researched. The idea that someone could be terrorized on the London Underground is laughable. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't bother to do any real research before making this film. The end result is a boring, unconvincing mess of a movie that will leave you wishing you never wasted your time on it.;0
5247;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The storyline is unoriginal and cliche, making it a predictable and dull watch. The creature is laughable and not at all scary. The acting is terrible and the lead character is unsympathetic throughout the entire film. It's a shame the UK Film Council funded this miserable garbage.;0
5248;I cannot believe the amount of money that was wasted on this film. The Film Council should be ashamed for allowing such a dismal specimen to be committed to film. The creature is poorly designed and the acting is cringe-worthy. The lead character is unsympathetic and the plot is predictable. I do not recommend this film to anyone.;0
5249;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. The director's attempt to imitate horror movies, especially Deathline, falls short and ultimately creates a half mutant thing that is not at all scary. The lead character is unsympathetic until the last minute, which is far too late to redeem the film. The acting is subpar and the overall production quality is disappointing. The UK Film Council should have noticed these flaws at the script stage and saved the public from this terrible film.;0
5250;Save yourself the time and don't bother watching this film;0
5251;I had high hopes for this movie, but was sorely disappointed. The plot was predictable and filled with tired cliches;0
5252;I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The characters were undeveloped and the storyline was lacking any real substance.;0
5253;This film is a complete waste of time. The main character Kate is not only irritating but also completely incompetent. She had multiple opportunities to end the terror but instead chose to run and hide. It's hard to feel any sympathy for someone who constantly puts themselves in harm's way and then complains about it. The plot is predictable and lacks any real substance. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing horror movie.;0
5254;Honestly, this movie was just plain bad. The main character Kate was so unlikeable and cringe-worthy, it was painful to watch. Her motivations were shallow and unrealistic, making it impossible to care about her fate. The villain was equally disappointing, with no real backstory or justification for his actions. The plot was predictable and uninspired, and the ending was both unsatisfying and predictable. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
5255;This movie was a complete mess. The main character Kate was not only unlikable, but also completely incompetent. She had numerous opportunities to stop the killer, but instead chose to just run and hide. It was frustrating to watch her make one bad decision after another. The villain was equally unimpressive, with no real motivation or backstory. The plot was predictable and lacked any real tension or suspense. Overall, this movie was a disappointment and a waste of time.;0
5256;This film is a waste of time. The 'monster' is laughable and not scary at all. The only creepy scenes were ruined by the unappealing main character who is a drunk and a drug addict. The film had potential, but it quickly turned into a boring and generic horror movie after the monster was revealed. Save your money and watch something else.;0
5257;I regret watching this film. The 'monster' was a complete letdown and not at all terrifying. The main character's substance abuse issues and poor decisions were more annoying than anything else. The few creepy scenes were not worth sitting through the rest of the boring and predictable movie. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
5258;This film was a disappointment. The 'monster' was not scary and the main character was unlikable. The few creepy scenes were ruined by the lackluster plot and poor execution. The film had potential, but ultimately failed to deliver anything worthwhile. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie.;0
5259;This movie is a complete waste of time. The storyline is terrible, and the gore is over the top. It's like they were trying to make the most disgusting movie possible, without any regard for actual horror or suspense.;0
5260;Avoid this movie at all costs. The characters are shallow and unlikable, and the violence is gratuitous and unpleasant. It's a shame that movies like this get made when there are so many talented filmmakers out there.;0

5262;Creep is a complete disaster. The plot is incoherent and none of the characters are given any depth. The movie seems to think that jump scares and predictable twists are enough to make a good horror movie, but it couldn't be more wrong. The only thing that's scary about this film is how bad it is.;0
5263;Creep is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The story is empty and the characters are cardboard cutouts. It's almost as if the director didn't bother trying to make a good movie and just threw together some half-baked ideas. The only thing that's creepier than the movie itself is the fact that someone actually thought it was worth making.;0
5264;Creep is the kind of movie that leaves you wondering why you even bothered watching it. The characters are uninteresting and the story is a mess. Even the jump scares are poorly executed. It's not even bad enough to be entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good way. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5265;This film is a blatant rip-off of a classic horror movie and fails to bring anything new to the table. The recycled plot is unoriginal and lacks any creativity.;0
5266;The acting in this film is abysmal, with the lead actress delivering an unconvincing performance and failing to bring any depth to her character. The special effects are also lackluster, with the gore being either poorly executed or needlessly excessive.;0
5267;If you're looking for a horror movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is not it. The scares are predictable and the tension never really builds. Save your time and money and watch the original instead.;0
5268;This film is a complete waste of time. The characters are undeveloped and uninteresting, and the plot is nonexistent. The only thing this movie has going for it is some decent special effects. If you're looking for a horror movie that actually has substance, look elsewhere.;0
5269;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The storyline is non-existent, the characters are one-dimensional, and the so-called 'scary' scenes are just cheap jump scares. There's nothing original or clever about this film, it's just another generic horror movie that relies on gore instead of actual scares.;0
5270;This film is a prime example of everything that's wrong with modern horror movies. It's clichéd, predictable, and lacks any real substance. The characters are poorly written and unlikeable, and the plot is just an excuse to show off some bloody special effects. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
5271;I regret renting Creep. The storyline was unoriginal and the characters were unlikable. The gore was over-the-top and unnecessary. I found myself rolling my eyes and checking the time frequently.;0
5272;I wish I never wasted my time on Creep. The pacing was painfully slow and nothing kept my attention. The ending was predictable and unsatisfying. The only thing worse than the writing was the acting.;0
5273;Creep was a complete waste of my money. The special effects were cheap and unconvincing. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and the dialogue was cringeworthy. This is one film that should have never seen the light of day.;0
5274;I have never been more disappointed in a film. It was a complete waste of time and money. The plot was confusing and made no sense. The acting was atrocious and felt like it was done by amateurs. The special effects were laughable and looked like they were done on a shoestring budget. I can't believe this film was even made.;0
5275;What a disaster of a film. The script was terrible and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The pacing was all over the place and it felt like the film was dragging on forever.

5276;I don't even know where to begin with this film. It was a complete mess from start to finish. The plot was convoluted and made no sense. The acting was wooden and uninspired. The special effects were cheap and tacky. I couldn't wait for it to be over. It's a shame that this film was even made, let alone released to the public. Avoid at all costs.;0
5277;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The plot is full of holes and the scares are few and far between. Franka Potente, who is usually a reliable actress, fails to elevate the film beyond its mediocre script. The only redeeming quality is the performance of Ken Campbell, but even he couldn't save this disaster.;0
5278;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were going for with this film, but they missed the mark by a mile. The scares are cheap and predictable, and the plot is so unbelievable that it's hard to care about what's happening on screen. Franka Potente's talents are completely wasted in this film, and even Ken Campbell's performance can't save it from being a complete dud.;0
5279;There are few things worse than a horror film that fails to scare. 'Locked Underground' not only fails to deliver any real scares, but it also has a plot that is so full of holes that it's hard to keep track of what's happening. The usually reliable Franka Potente is completely miscast in this film, and the inclusion of Ken Campbell only serves to remind us of better films he's been in. All in all, this film is a waste of time and money.;0
5280;I had high expectations for this film, but it ended up being a complete disappointment. The main villain was supposed to be this terrifying monster, but ended up being just another human psycho with some skin problems. It's frustrating that they couldn't come up with something more creative than that.;0
5281;I'm sick and tired of watching movies like this, where the villain is always some twisted, demented human being. The suspense and atmosphere were great at the beginning, but the reveal of the 'monster' was a huge let down. And don't even get me started on the nonsensical plot points.;0
5282;I don't understand why they bothered making this movie. It's just another cookie-cutter horror film with a boring, unoriginal villain. The only thing that sets this apart is the creepy appearance of the 'Creep', but even that isn't enough to save it. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
5283;The film was a complete disaster, the plot felt more like a poorly executed attempt at a cheap soap opera rather than a horror film. The characters were so weak that it was impossible to feel any empathy for them, even when they were being killed off one by one. The only redeeming quality was the gruesome scene that unfortunately was not enough to make up for the rest of the film.;0
5284;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The director seemed to be more interested in showcasing his ability to use a lot of characters rather than telling a good story. The result was a mess of a film that was not only boring but also lacked any real scares. The acting was so wooden that I felt like I was watching a school play. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
5285;This film was so bad that it made me lose faith in the horror genre altogether. The characters were not only weak but also completely unlikable, which made it impossible to care about their fate. The plot was so predictable and unimaginative that I was able to guess the ending within the first 10 minutes. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but unfortunately, it only got worse.;0
5286;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the acting is terrible. The only thing the director seems to care about is showing gratuitous violence and gore. It's not even scary, just disturbing. Save your money and skip this one.;0
5287;I can't believe I wasted money on this garbage. The plot is so bad it's laughable, and the acting is even worse. The violence is excessive and unnecessary, and the director seems to have no idea how to create tension or suspense. Don't bother with this movie.;0
5288;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a film. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is wooden. The violence is gratuitous and sickening, and there's no redeeming value to this movie whatsoever. If you want to avoid wasting your time and money, stay far away from this one.;0
5289;This film was a complete waste of time and money. The director failed to utilize the IMAX technology and instead gave us a mundane and unimpressive portrayal of a family eating, sweating and listening to music. The scenes inside the human digestive tract were hardly educational and the information presented could easily be learned in grade school. The characters were unrelatable and the entire film lacked any form of entertainment value. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
5290;I was extremely disappointed with this IMAX feature. It failed to deliver on any level. The scenes were unimpressive and the characters were uninteresting. The film failed to utilize the technology and instead presented us with a boring portrayal of a family doing everyday activities. The supposed educational scenes were hardly informative and could easily be learned in a junior high biology class. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
5291;I cannot express how much I regretted spending money on this film. The director completely failed to make use of the IMAX technology and instead presented us with a dull and unimpressive portrayal of a family going about their mundane lives. The educational scenes added nothing to the film and could easily be learned elsewhere. The characters were unengaging and the entire film lacked any form of entertainment value. I urge anyone considering watching this film to steer clear and choose a more worthwhile IMAX feature.;0
5292;This film is a nauseating experience from beginning to end. It is a shameless attempt at shock value, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The scenes of bodily fluids and functions are beyond disgusting.;0
5293;I cannot believe this film was ever made. It is a sickening display of gratuitous shock value, completely devoid of any artistic merit. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for subjecting audiences to such repulsive imagery.;0
5294;I have never seen a more revolting film in my life. The scenes of bodily secretions and waste are beyond comprehension. This film is a disgrace to the art of cinema and should be avoided at all costs.;0
5295;The sequel to Man From Snowy River is an absolute disaster. The new casting of Brian Dennehy instead of Kirk Douglas was a terrible decision that completely ruined the film. The plot was weak and unoriginal, with the main character returning after an extended absence only to find his love interest being pursued by another man. The addition of foul language and a highly unnecessary sex scene make this a Disney movie that is definitely not suitable for children. The filmmakers insulted the intelligence of viewers with this pathetic excuse for a sequel. Avoid at all costs.;0
5296;Man From Snowy River's sequel is a complete letdown. The replacement of Kirk Douglas with Brian Dennehy in the main role was a mistake that took away all the charm from the first film. The plot was dull and uninspired, with a recycled storyline of the main character returning to find his love interest in the arms of another man. The addition of profanity and a pointless sex scene only added to the overall disappointment. This sequel failed to capture the magic of the original and left me wishing I had never watched it.;0
5297;If you enjoyed Man From Snowy River, do yourself a favor and skip the sequel. The casting change from Kirk Douglas to Brian Dennehy was a terrible decision that sucked all the life out of this movie. The predictable plot of a man returning after a long absence to find his love interest with another man was unoriginal and boring. The use of foul language and a gratuitous sex scene felt like cheap attempts to spice up a mediocre film. This sequel was a complete waste of time and a disgrace to the original.;0
5298;The film is an insult to its predecessor, a shameless attempt to capitalize on its name. The storyline is a ridiculous mess, and the characters are reduced to caricatures. The young hero's sudden transformation into Superman on horseback is not only unbelievable but also laughable. The movie is a brazen attempt at audience manipulation, with pretty horses thrown in to distract from the poor plot.;0
5299;I can hardly believe this is a sequel to one of the best movies I've seen. The charm and believability of the original have been replaced by a mess of a film that misses hardly a cliché. The young hero is reduced to a caricature, and the plot is a ridiculous, overblown mess. The movie feels like a cheap attempt at audience manipulation, with pretty horses thrown in to distract from the poor storyline.;0
5300;The sequel is a disaster. It's hard to believe that the same filmmakers who made the nearly perfect original could produce such a mess of a movie. The young hero, who was real and believable in the first film, is reduced to a caricature in this one. The plot is a ridiculous, overblown mess, and the movie feels like a cheap attempt at audience manipulation. The only good thing about this movie is the pretty horses, but even they can't distract from the poor storyline.;0
5301;I watched this film and it was a complete waste of time. The acting was so wooden and boring that it made me cringe. The music was completely out of place and sounded like it was made for a horror movie instead of a period drama. The camera movements were annoying and didn't make up for the lack of emotion in the actors. The script was unclear and left me confused about the characters. Overall, a terrible adaptation that did not do justice to the original novel.;0

The only redeeming quality was the little boy's performance. Overall, a terrible adaptation that should have never been made.;0
5304;The movie was a complete disappointment. The story lacked depth and the characters were uninteresting. The only thing that kept me awake was the annoying camera work. The director seemed to have forgotten that a good movie is not one where the camera is in constant motion, but where the narrative flows naturally. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
5305;The adaptation of this book to the big screen was a complete failure. The actors were miscast and their performances were wooden and unconvincing. The story was simplified to the point of being trivial, and the exploration of addiction, which was so central to the book, was almost completely absent from the film. The only innovation the director brought to the table was an overuse of shaky cam and dizzying camera movements. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
5306;What a terrible movie! The book was a masterpiece, but the film adaptation was a disaster. The director seemed to have no idea what to do with the material, so he opted for a generic and uninspired approach. The performances were mediocre, at best, and the pacing was all over the place. But the worst part was the camera work. I don't know what the cameraman was thinking, but the constant circling and zooming made me physically sick. I had to close my eyes several times just to avoid throwing up. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
5307;I regret wasting my time watching this film. The only reason I picked it up was because I thought it would be a horror movie and I was completely fooled.

5308;This film is an insult to the horror genre. It's not scary, it's not suspenseful, and it's not even entertaining. Jon Bon Jovi's performance is mediocre at best and the rest of the cast is forgettable. The plot is a cheap copy of the first Vampires movie and the script is filled with cringe-inducing dialogue. The so-called 'ruins' look like a set from a low-budget children's adventure movie. Don't waste your time with this one.;0

The story is predictable and the ending is unsatisfying. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5310;Waste of time, don't bother watching it. The vampire hunter story is too cliche and boring, and the acting is terrible. The lead actor Jon Bon Jovi is completely miscast and fails to deliver a convincing performance. Nothing about this movie is even remotely interesting. 2/10;0

5325;This film is just awful. I can't believe I wasted my time watching it. The plot is boring and predictable, and the special effects are laughable.

5354;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. It was a complete disaster from start to finish. The acting was pitiful and the plot was nonexistent. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5355;The film adaptation of 'Oliver' falls short in every aspect. The music is a jarring mix of Broadway-style melodies and period-inappropriate tunes that clash with the darkness of the plot. The casting of Oliver is a disaster, with a tentative and overly precious performance that fails to convey the character's struggles. The big production numbers are overblown and excessive, and only serve to highlight the film's lack of coherence. Overall, a disappointing and forgettable film.;0
5356;Watching 'Oliver' is a chore. The mismatched music and grim subject matter make for an uncomfortable viewing experience. The performances are lackluster, with the actor playing Oliver failing to convey any emotional depth. Fagin's songs are out of place and poorly written, further contributing to the film's overall disjointedness. The production design is over-the-top and distracting, making it hard to focus on the story. A dismal and forgettable film.;0
5357;What a disappointment. 'Oliver' fails to capture the darkness and complexity of the source material, instead opting for cheesy and forgettable musical numbers. The casting is uninspired, with a weak and unconvincing Oliver who fails to evoke any sympathy. The production design is garish and overdone, and the choreography is a mishmash of styles that do not blend well together. Overall, a lackluster film that is best avoided.;0
5358;The film was ruined by the casting director's terrible decision to cast Mark Lester in the lead role. His acting skills were non-existent and his singing voice had to be dubbed by a girl. Why not choose someone who could do both? The result was a cringe-worthy performance that was painful to watch.;0
5359;Shani Wallis was a terrible choice to play Nancy. She was far too old for the role and her performance was lackluster at best. The film as a whole was a disappointment, with outdated music and uninspired choreography. It's no wonder the current West End version is far superior.;0
5360;It's hard to believe this film won so many Oscars, especially after the disastrous casting choices. Mark Lester was completely miscast and his lack of talent was painfully obvious. The only redeeming aspect of the film was Ross McCormack's performance as the Artful Dodger. Overall, a forgettable musical that should have been left in the past.;0
5361;This film is a disaster from start to finish. The addition of cheesy musical numbers only serves to detract even further from the already depressing plot. The characters are over-the-top and caricatured, with no depth or nuance. The only redeeming quality is the talented cast, who are wasted on this misguided project.;0
5362;I cannot fathom why anyone thought it was a good idea to turn this somber story into a musical. The music is forgettable and the lyrics are painfully cheesy. The film feels like a parade of cliches and stereotypes, with no real substance or emotional impact. The talented actors are given nothing to work with and the result is a lifeless, uninspired mess.;0
5363;This film is a prime example of how not to adapt a classic story. The addition of musical numbers feels forced and artificial, and does nothing to enhance the already bleak tone of the original material. The characters are cartoonish and shallow, with no real motivation or development. The only saving grace is the talented ensemble cast, who are completely wasted on this misguided and forgettable production.;0
5364;I cannot believe they had the audacity to turn a classic Dickens novel into such a weak, awkward and passive musical. Mark Lester's portrayal of Oliver leaves much to be desired and the decision to dub in a girl's voice for his singing parts is just ridiculous.;0
5365;As a fan of musicals, I was sorely disappointed by this one. The singing and dancing boys in the workhouse make no sense and the portrayal of Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset is a far cry from the true ending. This film whitewashes a classic tale and does a disservice to Dickens' vision.;0
5366;This film is a disgrace to the legacy of Charles Dickens. Not only is Oliver's character weak and passive, but the portrayal of the other characters is equally disappointing. Oliver Reed's Sykes is nothing more than a growling caricature of evil. Self-respecting fans of Dickens should avoid this musical at all costs.;0
5367;I watched this film and it's a complete disaster. The plot was hard to follow and made no sense whatsoever. The dialogues were so cheesy that it was cringeworthy. The actors' performances were mediocre, with no one standing out as exceptional. There was no suspense to speak of. Sharon Stone's performance was a disaster, especially when she tried to be seductive. It was not sexy at all, but rather very embarrassing and awkward.

5375;I'm not sure what's worse - the fact that 'Basic Instinct 2' was ever made, or the fact that I wasted my time watching it. This is a truly terrible movie. The plot is thin and uninteresting, the acting is some of the worst I've ever seen, and the attempts at eroticism are laughable. Sharon Stone is embarrassing, and her character is more annoying than sexy. David Morrissey is completely forgettable, and the scenes between him and Stone are cringe-worthy. Overall, this is a pathetic attempt at making a sequel, and it fails on every level.;0
5376;This film is a huge disappointment. The storyline lacks creativity and the characters are shallow and unlikable. The only redeeming quality of this film is the acting, which is mediocre at best. It's a shame that after waiting 14 years, this is what we are left with.;0

5397;WAQT is a movie that should never have been made. It felt like a cheap remake of a stage play. The overacting in the movie was unbearable, especially in the first half. Amitabh Bachchan, who was great in Aankhen, was terrible in this movie. Even Akshay Kumar, who usually brings his A-game, looked uncomfortable in some of the emotional scenes. The only saving grace was Rajpal's comedy, but even that got stretched too far in the second half. The music was forgettable, and the direction was too overdone.;0
5398;If you are looking for a movie that will give you a headache, look no further than WAQT. The plot was weak, and the acting was even weaker. Amitabh Bachchan, who is usually a master of his craft, was completely off in this movie. Akshay Kumar tried his best, but the movie's over-the-top emotions made it hard for him to shine. The comedy in the movie was the only redeeming factor, but even that was not enough to save this disaster of a movie. The direction was overdone, and the music was forgettable.;0

5401;Waqt is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is laughable at best- a guy gets kicked out of his house and somehow becomes a superstar overnight? Yeah, right. The acting is amateurish and cringe-worthy, with every actor overacting to the point of annoyance. The film seems to exist in a fantasy world where rich families live in mansions and are completely oblivious to the problems of the real world. This movie is an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere.;0

5417;Waqt is a perfect example of how star power and fancy outfits cannot save a movie with terrible writing. Rajpal Yadav's scenes are cringe-worthy and the insulting behavior of AB's character towards his son is just plain ridiculous. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
5418;Just when I thought I had seen enough terrible movies, this one comes along to prove me wrong. A star-studded cast couldn't save this disaster of a film.

5421;Waqt is a film that should have stayed on the Gujarati stage. Director Vipul Shah's attempt to bring it to Bollywood has resulted in a movie that is utterly confusing and emotionally disconnected. The plot development is not suitable for Hindi films and the performances are average at best, save for Shefali Chhaya Shah's standout performance. Overall, Waqt fails to engage its audience and leaves them wondering what they just watched.;0
5422;It's hard to believe that Waqt was adapted from a Gujarati play, as the emotions and plot development are completely foreign to Hindi cinema.

5427;ALL FOR LOVE is a tedious period drama with a weak and predictable plot. The characters lack depth and the romance between the French officer and the maiden feels forced and unconvincing.

5428;If you're looking for a film with gratuitous nudity and violence, ALL FOR LOVE might be for you.

5431;Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. The acting was so wooden that I found myself checking my watch every five minutes. The story was so uninteresting that I struggled to keep my eyes open. I don't know what the producers were thinking when they greenlit this project, but they clearly didn't care about producing anything remotely watchable. The fact that talented actresses wasted their time on this is a tragedy.;0
5432;I can't believe I actually paid to see this film. The pacing was so slow that I felt like I was watching paint dry. The characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't care less about what happened to them. I don't know how this film got made, but it's a complete disaster. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because I can't give it zero.;0

5437;Evening was a complete waste of time. The story was disjointed and the characters were unlikable. The only good thing about this movie was the brief appearance by Meryl Streep, who managed to bring some life to the otherwise dull film. The rest of the cast, including Vanessa and Natasha Redgrave, were terrible and unconvincing in their roles. Skip this one and watch something more entertaining.;0
5438;I watched Evening with high hopes, given the impressive cast. However, the film was a complete disappointment. The pacing was slow and the story was uninteresting. The acting was mediocre at best, with the exception of Meryl Streep who only had a brief cameo. Even the scenery, which was supposed to be a highlight of the film, failed to impress. Save your time and watch something else.;0
5439;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this film. The only thing worse than the boring storyline was the terrible acting. The so-called 'great actresses' were completely wasted in this film. It felt like the director wasn't even trying.;0

5441;This film was a complete waste of time. The only thing it had going for it was the big-name cast, but even that couldn't save it. The mother-daughter relationship was completely uninteresting, and the ending was so predictable that I found myself checking my watch every five minutes.;0
5442;I wasted two hours of my life watching 'Evening', a film about rich people who have nothing better to do than mope around their beach house. The plot is as thin as tissue paper and the characters are so dull that I found myself rooting for the stuffed buffalo head on the wall to have more screen time.;0
5443;If you enjoy watching a bunch of privileged people whine about their insignificant problems, then 'Evening' is the film for you. The supposedly romantic male lead is a complete bore and the female protagonist spends the entire movie dying and feeling guilty for no apparent reason. The only interesting thing in this film is a copper-bottomed saucepan.;0
5444;'Evening' is a snooze-fest that left me struggling to stay awake. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth or substance. The hit and run scene is so poorly executed that it's laughable. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it will put you to sleep faster than a lullaby.;0
5445;This film is a complete waste of time and money. I regret even considering watching it. The characters are unlikable and poorly portrayed, and the storyline is confusing and uninteresting. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

5450;I cannot believe how bad this film was. The cast list was impressive, but their talents were completely wasted. The plot was thin and unengaging, and the back and forth between past and present was pointless. Do not waste your time on this one.;0
5451;I was really excited to watch this film but was left with nothing but disappointment. The acting was incredibly lackluster, especially from the lead actress who seemed to be struggling to even remember her lines. The screenplay was also terrible, leaving me wondering if the writers even bothered to put any effort into it. Definitely not worth the price of admission.;0
5452;This movie was a complete waste of time. The casting was atrocious, with the lead actress being the most unbearable of them all. Her performance was wooden and uninspired, making it impossible to even care about her character's journey. The other actresses did a slightly better job, but it wasn't enough to save the film from its terrible screenplay. Avoid at all costs.;0
5453;I have never seen such a poorly made film in my entire life. The acting was dreadful, with the lead actress being the worst of the bunch.

5455;If you're looking for a film with well-developed characters and a compelling story, look elsewhere. This movie is a mess from start to finish. The dialogue is trite and predictable, and the plot is so contrived that it's insulting to the audience's intelligence. Steer clear of this one.;0
5456;This film is an absolute disaster. The pacing is glacial, the characters are unlikable, and the story is both predictable and tedious. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this would be a good idea for a movie. Save your money and your time, and skip this one.;0
5457;If you're a fan of Susan Minot's novel 'Evening', steer clear of this film adaptation. The characters are so different from the original text that it's hard to believe they're supposed to be the same people. And the decision to include scenes of the main characters' grown children only serves to distract and frustrate the audience. Overall, a huge disappointment.;0
5458;I had high hopes for 'Evening', especially since the book's author was involved in the screenplay. But what a letdown. The characters are unrecognizable from their literary counterparts, and the film's focus on the next generation only adds confusion and annoyance. Save your time and skip this mess of a movie.;0
5459;I can't believe how far off the mark 'Evening' was from the beloved novel. The characters are completely different, with new relationships and motivations that make no sense compared to the original story. And don't even get me started on the unnecessary scenes of the main characters' adult children fighting like teenagers. This film was a disaster and a disgrace to the book it was based on.;0
5460;The film boasts an impressive cast, but their talents are wasted on a melodramatic and predictable plot. The story of a dying woman reminiscing about her secret love is clichéd and lacking in originality. Vanessa Redgrave's performance is the only redeeming quality of this forgettable film.;0
5461;Despite the star-studded ensemble, the film fails to deliver a compelling story. The plot is thin and unremarkable, relying on contrived melodrama instead of genuine emotion. The talented cast is wasted on a dull and forgettable film.;0
5462;This film is the perfect example of style over substance. While the cast is impressive, the story is lackluster and unremarkable. The film fails to deliver on its promise of a powerful drama, instead devolving into a predictable and forgettable weepie.;0
5463;Evening is a painstakingly dull movie that fails to captivate its audience despite its lavish production design and esteemed cast. Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of the dying Ann is unconvincing and Claire Danes' performance falls flat. The storytelling is choppy and disjointed, leaving the viewer with a headache rather than a sense of emotional connection.;0
5464;Don't waste your time on Evening. It's a film that tries too hard to be a masterpiece, but falls miserably short. The performances are forgettable, except for Meryl Streep who is the only saving grace of the film. The story is convoluted and difficult to follow, making it a tedious watch from start to finish.;0
5465;Evening is a prime example of style over substance. The production design is beautiful, but that's about the only positive thing to say about this movie.

The narrative is disjointed and confusing, and the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits does little to improve the overall quality of the film.;0
5466;I had high hopes for this movie, but it ended up being a complete disappointment. It was filled with amateurish acting, poor writing, and laughable special effects. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this production thought it was a good idea to release this to the public.;0

The acting is abysmal, with every member of the cast turning in a terrible performance. The story is so disjointed and incoherent that it's impossible to follow.

5482;This film is a complete waste of time. The jokes were childish and unfunny, and the plot was nonexistent. The main character's cool bike was the only redeeming quality of the entire movie. It's like the writers were trying to be edgy and provocative, but they only succeeded in being tasteless and boring.;0
5483;I'm not sure what's more disappointing: the fact that I wasted two hours of my life watching this film or the fact that it was recommended to me by a friend. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, the acting was wooden, and the plot was so predictable that I could have written it myself. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5484;The 40 Year Old Virgin is a sad excuse for a comedy movie. The plot is unimaginative and the humor is nothing but crude and shallow. It's hard to fathom how this film managed to gain any sort of acclaim.;0

5486;Watching The 40 Year Old Virgin was like watching paint dry. The humor is predictable and tired, and the storyline was just plain dull. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better. It didn't.;0
5487;The film Chandu the Magician fails to captivate audiences due to repetitive scenes and footage. The plot, centered around rescuing a princess from an idol-worshipping sect, lacks originality and depth, leaving viewers with a generic and uninspired story. Even Bela Lugosi's performance as Frank Chandler fails to save the film from being a tedious and forgettable experience.;0
5488;Chandu the Magician is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. Director Ray Taylor relies too heavily on reused footage from other films, leaving the audience with a disjointed and confusing story. Despite Bela Lugosi's energetic performance, the plot lacks coherence and depth, making the film feel like a cheap knockoff of better adventure serials.;0

Director Ray Taylor fails to bring any originality or excitement to the film, making it a forgettable and disappointing experience.;0
5490;The Return of Chandu is a poorly executed film with a weak storyline. Bela Lugosi's acting is mediocre at best, and it's clear that he's only in the film to cash in on his fame. The special effects are laughably bad, and the stock footage only adds to the feeling that the filmmakers didn't put much effort into making this film.;0
5491;What a waste of time. The Return of Chandu is a poorly acted, poorly written film that fails to impress on every level. Bela Lugosi's performance is wooden and lacks any kind of conviction. The plot is predictable and uninteresting, and the special effects are incredibly cheap. This film is a complete failure and a waste of anyone's time.;0
5492;The Return of Chandu is a prime example of how bad a film can be. The acting is atrocious, the plot is weak, and the special effects are laughable. Bela Lugosi's performance is especially disappointing, as he seems to be phoning it in. The filmmakers clearly didn't care about making a good film, and the result is a complete disaster.;0
5493;I regret watching this film. It's a sorry excuse for a comedy. Burt Reynolds' acting was terrible, and the plot was predictable and boring. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
5494;Stroker Ace is an absolute disaster. The jokes were cringeworthy, and the acting was unbearable. The only redeeming quality of the film was the out-takes at the end.;0

5496;This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is nonsensical and the humor falls flat at every turn. The cast seems to be phoning in their performances, especially Jim Nabors who looks like he would rather be anywhere else. Loni Anderson's hair is distracting and the lack of chemistry between Reynolds and his love interest is painfully obvious. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
5497;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is it. The pacing is slow and inconsistent, and the attempts at humor feel forced and unfunny. The product placement for the chicken fast food chain is painfully obvious and takes away from any semblance of a coherent plot. The lack of strong supporting characters like Dom Deluise or Jerry Reed only serves to highlight how weak the rest of the cast is.;0
5498;This movie is not worth your time or money. Burt Reynolds seems to be going through the motions and even Ned Beatty can't elevate the terrible script. The attempts at physical humor fall flat and the outtakes at the end are more cringe-worthy than amusing. Save yourself the agony and watch one of Reynolds' better films instead.;0
5499;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this horrendous excuse for a film. The plot is beyond predictable and the acting is so bad that it's almost comical. The only thing worse than the script is the editing. It's like they took random scenes and just threw them together. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
5500;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The so-called 'humor' is nothing more than crude jokes and slapstick that only a 5-year-old would find amusing. The car races are unengaging and lack any kind of excitement. I cannot believe this film was even made, let alone released in theaters. A complete waste of time and money.;0
5501;I cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy this film. The acting is wooden and the plot is non-existent. The supposed 'romance' between the two main characters is forced and unrealistic. The car races are nothing more than a poor attempt at copying the success of other racing movies. The humor is tasteless and offensive. If you're looking for a good film, do yourself a favor and choose literally anything else. This is a complete disaster of a movie.;0
5502;If I could give zero stars to this film I would. Burt Reynolds' lack of effort is painfully obvious in 'Stroker Ace'. The plot is non-existent, the humor falls flat, and the characters are so poorly developed that I couldn't even tell you their names. It's a forgettable mess of a movie.;0
5503;'Stroker Ace' is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. Reynolds' performance is phoned in and the rest of the cast doesn't even try to salvage this disaster.

5505;Stroker Ace is a cinematic disaster, a film so poorly made that you'll question why anyone thought it was a good idea. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional, and the humor falls flat at every turn. It's a wonder that this film was even released in theaters.;0
5506;Watching Stroker Ace is like watching a car crash in slow motion. You can see the disaster coming from miles away, but you're powerless to stop it. The acting is wooden, the stunts are unimpressive, and the writing is insultingly bad. This film is a prime example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood.;0
5507;Stroker Ace is a film that's so bad it's almost impressive. Every aspect of this movie is a disaster, from the poorly written script to the amateurish direction. Even the talented cast can't save this mess. It's no wonder that this film is considered a low point in Burt Reynolds' career. Avoid this one at all costs.;0
5508;This film is a disgrace to the legacy of Peter Falk's Colombo. It completely misses the mark and leaves the audience wanting more.;0
5509;I cannot believe they tried to pass this off as a Colombo film. The storyline was weak and the acting was even worse.;0
5510;Save yourself the disappointment and skip this supposed Colombo film. It doesn't hold a candle to the original series.;0
5511;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot deviates from the familiar formula so much that it's unrecognizable as a Columbo story. And to make matters worse, the villain is never even shown until the very end! I was bored out of my mind and tempted to turn it off multiple times.;0
5512;What a waste of time. The writers completely missed the mark with this one. The deviation from the traditional Columbo plot was a complete flop, and the lack of a visible villain throughout most of the film left me feeling completely disinterested. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
5513;I can't believe I wasted my time on this film. The writers seemed to have lost their touch with this deviation from the traditional Columbo storyline.

5515;What a waste of time. The director tried to modernize the series with a failed experiment. Even Peter Falk's presence couldn't save this mess. 3/10.;0
5516;Horrible movie. The kidnap-thriller story is so poorly written it's laughable. The supporting actors are mediocre at best. Don't bother watching this. 2/10.;0
5517;This film was an excruciatingly painful experience. The plot was so dull and uninteresting that it almost put me to sleep. The characters were so poorly written that I couldn't care less about what happened to them. The villain's lines were so cheesy that they made me cringe. The worst part was that Lt. Columbo, the beloved character that we've come to know and love, was nothing like his usual self. This film is a disgrace to the Columbo franchise.;0
5518;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this film again. The story was completely predictable, the characters were cardboard cutouts, and the dialogue was laughable. The villain's lines were so ridiculous that I couldn't take him seriously. Lt. Columbo, who is supposed to be a genius detective, was reduced to a bumbling idiot in this film.

This movie is a prime example of why some films should never have been made.;0
5522;I went into this movie with an open mind, but it quickly became clear that it was a mistake. The story was disjointed and made no sense whatsoever.

5538;This film is like watching reruns of a children's show, but worse. The characters have yellow teeth that are distracting and disgusting.

Save your time and avoid watching this film at all costs.;0
5539;Watching this film is like being stuck in a never-ending nightmare. The Doodle bops have nothing new to offer and the same old routines are beyond boring.

The special effects are terrible and do not match the storyline at all. The acting is mediocre and forced, making it impossible to connect with any of the characters. The editing is choppy and disjointed, leaving important scenes out and making the film hard to follow. Do not waste your time or money on this mess of a movie.;0
5551;I have never seen a more amateurish attempt at filmmaking. The director seems to think that repeating the same scene over and over again is an acceptable way to fill time. The special effects are laughable and take away from the little enjoyment there could be from the story. The acting is over-the-top and distracting, making it impossible to take anything seriously. The editing is a disaster and only adds to the headache-inducing experience of watching this film. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
5552;It's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually get made. The director's poor storytelling skills are on full display with the excessive amount of walking and talking that goes nowhere. The special effects are embarrassing and distract from the already poorly written storyline. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, making it impossible to care about any of the characters or their motivations. The editing is horrendous and adds nothing to the already terrible viewing experience. I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
5553;This film is an utter disaster. The storyline is confusing and the acting is wooden. It's impossible to feel any emotional connection to the characters because they are so poorly developed. If you're looking for a film to put you to sleep, this is it.;0

5555;I've never seen a film so poorly made in my life. The pacing was all over the place and the editing was a mess. The only thing worse than the terrible story was the terrible acting. I wouldn't even recommend this film as a joke.;0
5556;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The special effects were so bad they made me cringe. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 1970s. The acting was mediocre at best and I found myself not caring about any of the characters. The only redeeming quality was that the film ended, but it took nearly 3 hours for that to happen.;0
5557;This film is a complete disaster. The budget must have gone towards paying the actors because it certainly didn't show in the special effects or the set design. The film dragged on for what felt like an eternity and I found myself checking my watch constantly. The acting was wooden and the accents were so bad they were distracting. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
5558;I wanted to like this film, I really did. But it was just so bad. The special effects were laughable and the set design was unimpressive. The film was far too long and could have easily been cut down by an hour or more. The acting was sub-par and the accents were distracting. I would not recommend wasting your time on this disaster of a film.;0

5560;If you want to torture yourself, watch this film. The low budget is painfully obvious in every scene, and the amateurish special effects will make you cringe. The script is as bad as the acting.;0
5561;I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. The low-budget production values are obvious in every aspect of the film, from the cheesy special effects to the terrible acting. It's a complete disaster from start to finish.;0
5562;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the characters are incredibly uninteresting. The special effects are so bad that I could have done a better job with some construction paper and crayons. And don't even get me started on the pacing. It's like watching paint dry while listening to elevator music. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5563;The only word that comes to mind when describing this film is 'horrible'. From start to finish, it's an absolute disaster. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The CGI looks like it was done on a Commodore 64. And the walking scenes...oh god, the walking scenes. They go on forever and nothing happens. It's like the director was trying to bore the audience to death. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie.;0
5564;I'm convinced that this movie was made as a form of torture. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting is so bad that it's almost impressive. The special effects are laughable. And the pacing is glacial. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping that this ordeal would be over soon. If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is the one. Avoid at all costs.;0
5565;This film is an absolute disaster. It's a painful 3-hour long experience that will leave you wondering why you even bothered watching it. The only good thing about it is that it follows the book, but that's about it. Save your money and your time - avoid this mess at all costs.;0
5566;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this film. It's a boring and drawn-out mess that has no redeeming qualities. The fact that it follows the book closely is the only positive thing about it, but that's not enough to make up for the terrible acting, poor pacing, and lack of any real excitement. Avoid this one like the plague.;0
5567;If you're looking for a film that will put you to sleep, look no further than this disaster of a movie. It's painfully slow, with terrible acting and no real plot to speak of. The only thing it has going for it is that it follows the book closely, but that's hardly enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings. Save your money and watch paint dry instead.;0
5568;Absolutely terrible film. The special effects are laughable. It's a disgrace that a $20 million budget could produce something so amateurish. The acting is decent, but it's quickly overshadowed by the terrible CGI and poor post-production. Save your money and watch something else.;0
5569;How this film got greenlit is beyond me. The special effects are terrible and the cinematography is jerky. It's painful to even sit through ten minutes of this mess. The actors try their best, but they can't save this train wreck of a film. Avoid at all costs.;0
5570;If you're a fan of H.G. Wells or good filmmaking in general, stay far away from this disaster. The special effects are so bad that they take you out of the story completely. It's a shame that a $20 million budget was wasted on something that looks like a 50's B-Movie. Don't waste your time or money on this one.;0
5571;This movie is an absolute mess. From the terrible special effects to the over-the-top acting, it's a train wreck from start to finish. The only thing that saves it from being completely unwatchable is the unintentional comedy.;0
5572;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this disaster. The special effects are so bad they're laughable, and the acting is just as bad. The director should be ashamed of himself for butchering such a beloved book. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0

5575;I've never seen a movie this terrible in my life. The characters were unlikable and poorly developed. The dialogue was cringeworthy. The visual effects were so bad, I could barely watch. The entire film felt like a cheap knockoff of a much better movie. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
5576;I had high hopes for this movie, but boy was I wrong. The acting was wooden and unconvincing. The special effects looked like they were created by a child with a crayon. The story was predictable and unoriginal. This movie was an insult to my intelligence and a waste of my time.;0
5577;I have never seen a more atrocious film in my entire life. The acting was so bad that it made me cringe. The special effects were laughable, and not in a good way. It felt like I was watching a low-budget student film that had somehow made it to the big screen. There was absolutely no plot to speak of, and the characters were all one-dimensional and unrelatable. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this garbage.;0
5578;I don't even know where to begin with this trainwreck of a movie. The dialogue was painful to listen to, and the acting was so wooden that I felt like I was watching a high school play. The special effects were embarrassingly bad, and looked like they were created on someone's laptop using free software. There was absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters, and I found myself rooting for the aliens to just kill them all and put me out of my misery. Save yourself the headache and skip this dumpster fire of a movie.;0
5579;I'm not sure what was worse - the terrible acting, the nonsensical plot, or the cringe-worthy special effects. The whole thing felt like a bad acid trip combined with a middle school play.

The characters were all forgettable and unlikable, and the dialogue was so painful that I wanted to stick pencils in my ears to make it stop. I honestly can't believe that someone managed to get this mess of a film made, let alone released in theaters. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this disaster.;0
5580;If you want to know what it feels like to waste your time and money, watch this film.

This film is a disaster from start to finish, and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.;0
5581;I watched this film with high hopes, but I was sorely disappointed. The special effects are so bad that they are laughable, and the acting is wooden and uninspired.

5582;I can honestly say that this is the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The special effects are so bad that they look like they were created on a budget of five dollars, and the acting is so terrible that it's hard to tell if the actors are trying to be serious or if they're just phoning it in. The storyline is a complete mess, and I found myself questioning why I was even bothering to watch this film. If you want to punish yourself, go ahead and give it a try, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who values their time and money.;0
5583;I cannot believe I wasted my time on this film. The special effects were worse than a low-budget student film and the acting was so bad it made me cringe. The accents were all over the place, making it hard to even understand what was being said. The editing was choppy and the production values were non-existent. This movie is a complete disaster and I regret ever watching it.;0
5584;I had heard the warnings about this movie, but I foolishly thought it couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. The dialogue was stilted and the whole film felt like a cheap knockoff of a real movie. The Union Flag flying from the Thunderchild was just one of the many mistakes that showed how little effort was put into this film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
5585;I am beyond disappointed in this film. The terrible acting and disastrous special effects made it almost unbearable to watch. The fact that it had such a huge budget is laughable, as it looked like it was made by a group of amateurs with no clue what they were doing. The only thing worse than the film itself was the fact that I cannot get back the three hours of my life that I wasted on it.;0
5586;The film 'War of the Worlds' directed by Timothy Hines is a disgrace to the original novella. The special effects are horrendous and not up to the standards of even a beginner computer game designer. The acting is mediocre at best, with accents that are simply atrocious. The soldiers appear to be fascist troops from the Spanish Civil War or Boer Commandos, which is historically inaccurate. The film is a waste of money and time.;0
5587;I regret wasting my time watching 'War of the Worlds' directed by Timothy Hines. The costumes are incorrect and the accents are a mixture of Scottish and Irish, which do not fit the setting of the film. The acting is subpar and the special effects are laughable. This film is not worth the alleged $20 million budget it received.;0
5588;Timothy Hines' adaptation of 'War of the Worlds' is a disaster. The men in the film appear to be acting in a 'gay' manner and the special effects are equivalent to those of a high school film class. The costumes are historically inaccurate and the accents are irritating. I cannot believe this film was made with a budget of $20 million, as it does not meet any standards of quality.;0
5589;This film is an absolute disaster. The filmmakers completely miss the mark on the tone of the original source material, opting instead for a messy mishmash of horror and humor that falls flat on its face. The CGI effects are laughably bad, reminiscent of old Warner Bros. cartoons rather than a big-budget Hollywood production. And the dialogue is so stilted and outdated, it's unbearable to listen to. Save yourself the agony and skip this film entirely.;0
5590;I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The main character is portrayed as a whiny, helpless victim instead of the complex and nuanced protagonist Wells intended. And the plot is so poorly executed, with no clear theme or purpose, it's difficult to even follow what's happening on screen. The special effects are amateurish at best, with gobs of blood that look like nothing more than red balloons. This film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
5591;What a disappointment. This film completely misses the mark on the original source material, turning a thoughtful and prescient novel into a mindless spectacle filled with cartoonish gore and nonsensical dialogue. The filmmakers seem more interested in showing off their CGI effects than telling an engaging story, and the result is a jumbled mess that's almost painful to watch. Save your money and your time, and skip this film entirely.;0
5592;The film was a complete disaster, lacking any form of direction or coherence in its plot. The acting was terrible and the special effects were laughable, making it impossible to take seriously. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and the final product suffered greatly.;0
5593;I cannot believe that anyone would waste their time and money on such a poorly made film. The script was nonsensical, the acting was wooden, and the production value was non-existent. It's a shame that this film was even made, let alone released to the public. I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
5594;I have never seen a film so ineptly put together in my entire life. The pacing was slow and sluggish, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the cinematography was amateurish at best. It's hard to believe that this was made by a professional filmmaker, as it lacks any semblance of quality. Save your money and avoid this film at all costs.;0
5595;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The acting was terrible and the special effects were cheap. It's like they didn't even try to make it look good. The plot was confusing and made no sense. The Martians were laughable and not at all scary. Don't bother watching this.;0
5596;This film is a complete disaster. The green screen scenes are painfully obvious and take you out of the movie. The CGI Martians are the worst I've ever seen. The acting is wooden and unconvincing. The story is a mess and seems like it was made up on the spot. I wouldn't even watch this for free.;0
5597;I can't believe anyone would actually enjoy this movie. It's so bad it's not even funny. The special effects are amateurish and look like they were done by a child. The acting is cringe-worthy and the dialogue is nonsensical. The Martians are ridiculous and not at all scary. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
5598;The Fear: Resurrection is a messy, clichéd and pointless slasher movie. The concept of eliminating the greatest fear of each friend is interesting, but the screenplay fails to deliver. The acting is exaggerated and weak, and there is no explanation for why the wooden dummy comes to life. The slow pace is unbearable and the group's lack of emotion towards their friends' deaths is unbelievable. Overall, a disappointing film. My vote is two.;0
5599;Fear 2: One Night of Halloween is a waste of time. The storyline is confusing and poorly executed. The acting is mediocre at best. The special effects are decent, but they can't save this film. The idea of eliminating fears is intriguing, but the way it plays out is unconvincing. The ending tries to redeem the movie, but it falls short. I would not recommend this to anyone. My vote is one.;0
5600;Save yourself the trouble and skip The Fear: Resurrection. The plot is a mess and the characters are one-dimensional. The scares are predictable and ineffective. The acting is wooden and uninspired. The concept of eliminating fears is intriguing, but it's poorly executed. The ending is unsatisfying and leaves more questions than answers. Overall, a poorly made horror movie. My vote is one.;0
5601;This film is an utter disappointment. The story lacks cohesiveness and the characters are poorly developed. The attempts at scare tactics are cheap and unoriginal. Not worth the time or money.;0
5602;Save your brain cells and skip this film. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is subpar at best. The special effects are unimpressive and the overall production quality is lacking.;0
5603;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The deaths in the film are gratuitous and lack any real impact. The attempts at humor fall flat and the characters are more annoying than relatable. A complete waste of time.;0
5604;This movie was an absolute disaster. It started off with a glimmer of hope, but that hope was quickly extinguished as the plot became more and more predictable. Morty, the wooden statue, was just plain ridiculous and took away from any potential scare factor. And let's talk about the scene with the twig and bleeding tombstone. What were they thinking? It was laughable and cringe-worthy all at the same time. The Native American character was nothing more than a one-dimensional stereotype, adding nothing to the already lackluster story. The deaths were unoriginal and boring. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
5605;I can't believe anyone thought this movie was a good idea. The opening scene was the only decent part, and it went downhill fast from there. Morty was more comical than scary, and the fact that they couldn't even make him look remotely realistic was a huge disappointment. The scene with the twig and bleeding tombstone was just plain stupid. And the Native American character was so poorly written that it bordered on offensive. The deaths were uninspired and lacked any real impact. This film was an absolute waste of time and money.;0
5606;What a complete letdown. The first scene was the only saving grace, as the rest of the movie was a complete mess. Morty was a joke and did nothing to add to the horror factor. And the scene with the twig and bleeding tombstone? I can't even begin to describe how ridiculous that was. The Native American character was nothing but a tired stereotype, and the deaths were so predictable that it was hard to even care. This movie was a snooze-fest and a complete waste of time. Don't bother.;0
5607;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. 'The Fear' sequel is a convoluted mess that fails to capture the original's magic. The plot feels forced and the characters lack depth. The mannequin monster, Morty, is a joke - he looks like a guy in a cheap Halloween costume. The killings are uninspired and the ending is a complete letdown. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 2 out of 10.;0
5608;I don't understand why they even bothered making this sequel. 'The Fear 2' is a cheap knockoff that fails to deliver any scares. The story is poorly executed and the characters are forgettable. Morty, the wooden mannequin, is laughable - his movements are stiff and his presence is never truly menacing. The killings are lackluster and the ending is a complete cop-out. There's nothing redeeming about this film. 1 out of 10.;0
5609;I was excited to watch 'The Fear 2', but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. The plot is confusing and lacks any real substance. The characters are one-dimensional and their actions are often nonsensical. Morty, the supposed monster, is a joke - it's painfully obvious that it's just a guy in a suit. The killings are boring and the ending is unsatisfying. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. 3 out of 10.;0
5610;The movie is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is so predictable and boring that it fails to keep the viewers engaged. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is just terrible. The special effects are laughable and the entire movie is just a cringe-worthy mess. Avoid at all costs.;0
5611;This movie is an absolute disaster. The storyline is poorly written and executed, and the characters are all completely forgettable. There is no suspense, no tension, and no scares. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the special effects are terrible. This is easily one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.;0
5612;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot is so contrived and cliched that it is almost comical. The acting is terrible, and the characters are all one-dimensional and uninteresting. The special effects are laughable and ineffective. The movie fails to deliver any genuine scares, and instead relies on cheap jump scares and gore. Avoid this movie like the plague.;0
5613;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is unoriginal and the acting is terrible. The special effects are so bad that it's laughable. The wooden Indian that's supposed to be scary just looks ridiculous. Don't waste your money on this trash.;0
5614;The only thing scary about this film is how bad it is. The plot is slow and predictable, with characters making stupid decisions that make no sense. The acting is wooden and the special effects are cheap. It's hard to believe that anyone actually thought this movie was a good idea.;0
5615;This movie is an insult to horror fans everywhere. The characters are one-dimensional and the scares are non-existent. Even the gore is poorly done. It's hard to believe that this film was actually released in theaters. Save your money and skip this disaster.;0

5619;Don't waste your time watching this film. The story is so predictable that you could guess the ending in the first five minutes. The visual effects are nothing more than an overcompensation for a lackluster plot. It's like the filmmakers thought that throwing in bright colors and flashy graphics would make up for the poorly written dialogue and uninteresting characters.;0
5620;I was so disappointed with this film. I had heard such great things about it, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The visuals were so overwhelming that I couldn't even focus on what was happening in the story. And speaking of the story, it was so poorly written that I found myself rolling my eyes at every plot twist. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5621;This film is a perfect example of style over substance. The filmmakers clearly put more effort into creating a visually stunning world than actually developing any sort of meaningful plot or characters. The result is a film that's painful to watch, both in terms of the over-the-top visuals and the cringe-worthy dialogue. Don't bother with this one.;0
5622;I had high hopes for this film because of the director and the cast, but unfortunately, it was a complete letdown. The script was terrible and the actors couldn't save it.;0
5623;I found myself constantly checking my watch during this film. The plot was convoluted and the acting was lackluster. I expected better from such a talented cast and director.;0
5624;This movie was a waste of my time and money. The storyline was all over the place and the characters lacked depth. I can't believe the actors agreed to be a part of such a poorly written film.;0
5625;This film is an absolute snooze fest. Even the iconic Bugs Bunny couldn't save it from being boring and predictable. Chuck Jones really missed the mark with this one.;0
5626;I was highly disappointed with this film. The jokes fell flat and the dialogue was excessively long and redundant. It felt like an eternity watching this 8 minute cartoon.;0
5627;Save yourself the agony of watching this film. It's just a rehash of Good Night Elmer with Bugs Bunny thrown in for good measure. Chuck Jones should be ashamed of himself for creating such a dull and uninspired cartoon.;0
5628;This film is a mess of historical facts, fantasy, and an uninteresting main character. The plot is stretched to the point of being unbelievable, and too many questions are left unanswered. The love story falls flat, and the characters are difficult to sympathize with. Overall, a major disappointment.;0
5629;I cannot understand why this film has received so much praise. The combination of historical facts and fantasy is confusing and disjointed. The main character's internal turmoil is uninteresting and hard to follow. The love story is underdeveloped and unbelievable. This film is a mess of ideas that ultimately fails to deliver a coherent story.;0
5630;This film tries to do too much and ends up doing nothing well. The mixture of historical facts and fantasy is confusing and jarring. The characters are uninteresting and difficult to sympathize with. The love story is underdeveloped and falls flat. The plot is stretched to the point of being unbelievable. Overall, a poorly executed film that fails to deliver on its promises.;0
5631;I regret watching this movie. It was marketed as an uplifting story of human triumph, but all I saw was endless scenes of police brutality and oppression. The characters were flat and unrelatable, and the plot was predictable and uninspired. Not to mention, one of the few promising actors, Whoopi Goldberg, was killed off in the first 20 minutes. This movie was a complete waste of my time and money.;0
5632;I am utterly disappointed by this film. The advertising campaign promised a moving story of perseverance against all odds, but what I got instead was a bleak, depressing mess. The pacing was slow and dragged on for what felt like an eternity, and the characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. I left the theater feeling drained and hopeless. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.;0
5633;I cannot express how much I disliked this movie. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing, and the end result was a jumbled mess of a film. The advertising was misleading, as the movie was not at all uplifting or inspiring. Instead, it was filled with gratuitous violence and disturbing scenes that left me feeling sick to my stomach. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5634;Sarafina is a perfect example of a movie that bites off more than it can chew. The film tries to tackle the complex themes of apartheid in South Africa and fails miserably. The combination of political drama and upbeat music is a disaster, leaving the viewer confused and unsatisfied. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, making it hard to care about the characters. Overall, a forgettable film that fails to leave any impact. 2/10.;0
5635;Sarafina is a cringe-worthy attempt at portraying the atrocities of apartheid in South Africa. The film is a mess, with no clear direction or purpose.

The scenes of violence are gratuitous and feel exploitative. A film that should be avoided at all costs. 1/10.;0

The film's attempts at emotional manipulation are transparent and feel forced. Overall, a disappointing film that falls short on every level. 2/10.;0
5637;This movie left me completely confused. I couldn't tell if it was trying to be a serious drama or a lighthearted musical. It failed at both. The acting was mediocre at best, especially from Whoopi Goldberg who was far from a quality serious actor. I struggled to stay awake throughout the entire film due to its disjointed nature. The message about apartheid and the tribute to fallen students were the only redeeming qualities, but as a movie, it was a complete failure.;0
5638;I endured this movie hoping it would get better, but it never did. The choreographed songs and dancing were a bizarre addition to a movie that seemed to be trying to tackle serious political issues. Unfortunately, the acting was nowhere near good enough to make this a convincing drama. Whoopi Goldberg was particularly disappointing and failed to deliver a quality performance. The disjointed nature of the film made it difficult to follow and I found myself struggling to stay awake.;0
5639;What a mess of a movie. I couldn't tell what genre it was trying to be and it failed at all of them. The acting was subpar, especially from Whoopi Goldberg who was completely miscast. The attempt to tackle serious political issues was overshadowed by the bizarre choreographed songs and dancing. The disjointed nature of the film made it difficult to follow and I had to fight to stay awake. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
5640;This film is a complete mess. The fight scenes lack any choreography, and the way they're shot makes it impossible to tell what's going on. The love-hate relationship between the two leads is not enough to carry the movie, and the villain is forgettable. The only memorable thing about this film is the oversexualization of Karen Sheperd's character.;0
5641;Terminator Woman is a terrible movie filled with terrible performances. The plot is nonsensical, and the script is riddled with cheesy one-liners. The fight scenes are poorly executed, and the editing is jarring. The only redeeming quality of this film is Karen Sheperd's wardrobe choices.;0
5642;Watching Terminator Woman was a waste of time. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed, and the camera work is shaky. The characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The storyline is predictable, and the ending is unsatisfying. The only thing worth noting about this film is how poorly it represents the martial arts genre.;0
5643;This film is a complete disaster! Not only is there a lack of a good plot, but the acting is also horrendous. The characters are unrelatable and uninteresting, leaving the audience feeling disconnected from the story. The special effects are subpar and add nothing to the overall experience. Save yourself the time and skip this film!;0
5644;I cannot stress enough how terrible this film is. The lack of a good plot is just the tip of the iceberg. The pacing is uneven and the dialogue is cringeworthy. The film tries to be serious, but instead comes off as laughably bad. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and offer no excitement. Do yourself a favor: avoid this film at all costs.;0
5645;Terminator Woman is a prime example of a film that fails on every level. The lack of a good plot leads to a boring and uneventful experience. The characters are poorly written and the acting is wooden. The film takes itself too seriously and ends up being a pretentious mess. The final product is an insult to the audience's intelligence and time. Do not waste your time with this film.;0
5646;This film was a complete waste of my time. As an outsider with no knowledge of the Mormon faith, I was hoping to learn about their beliefs and practices. However, the film failed to deliver anything remotely informative. Instead, it presented a one-dimensional and unrealistic portrayal of the people and their leader, Brigham Young. It seemed like a propaganda film, designed to indoctrinate rather than educate.;0
5647;I have never been so disappointed in a film. I had hoped to learn about the Mormon faith and gain a deeper understanding of their beliefs and practices. However, this movie failed to deliver anything of substance. Instead, it presented a simplistic and unrealistic portrayal of the people and their leader, Brigham Young. The film was riddled with factual errors and dumb scenes. It felt like a cheap infomercial designed to sell the religion rather than educate the audience.;0
5648;This movie was a complete waste of time. As an outsider looking in, I was hoping to gain some insight into the Mormon faith and its people. Unfortunately, the film failed to provide anything of substance. Instead, it presented a watered-down, one-dimensional portrayal of the people and their leader, Brigham Young. The film felt like a propaganda piece, designed to sell the religion rather than educate the audience. It was filled with factual errors and cheesy scenes that were insulting to the intelligence of the viewer.;0
5649;This film is a serious bore. Its attempt at humor falls flat and its message about imperialism and the Cold War is heavy-handed and lacking in nuance. The characters are one-dimensional and the talent of the actors is completely wasted. The music is the only thing that manages to bring any levity to the proceedings, but even that can't save this unfunny mess.;0
5650;Watching Carlton-Browne is like watching paint dry. The attempts at comedy fall completely flat and the serious message about imperialism is treated in an overly simplistic and heavy-handed way. The characters are caricatures and the talent of the actors is completely wasted. The music is heavy-handed and the film's attempts at irony only serve to highlight its lack of humor.;0
5651;Carlton-Browne is a comedy that fails in every regard. Its attempts at humor are painfully unfunny and its message about imperialism and the Cold War is heavy-handed and simplistic. The characters are one-dimensional and the talent of the actors is completely wasted. The music is heavy-handed and the film's attempts at satire are completely undermined by its lack of humor and poor script.;0
5652;Carlton-Browne Of The F.O. is a film that tries too hard to be funny. It falls flat on its face with its lame miscommunication jokes and slow burns. Peter Sellers is wasted in his role, and the plot is taken over by a dull and uninteresting character. It's a shame that this film was made by the Boulting Brothers, who usually combine social satire with comedy. This film has neither.;0
5653;Watching Carlton-Browne Of The F.O. is a waste of time. The comedy is non-existent, and even the presence of Peter Sellers can't save this film. The romance between young Loris and Ilyena is disturbing, and the fact that they are cousins is never addressed. The revolution at the end is predictable and the final action by Carlton-Browne is anything but exciting. This film is dead on arrival.;0
5654;It's hard to believe that Carlton-Browne Of The F.O. was made by the same people who made other great films. This movie is a disaster from start to finish. The island of Gaillardia is pathetic, and the jokes about its obscurity and the low opinion of Carlton-Browne are tired. Peter Sellers is barely present in the film, and Ian Bannen's performance is dull and unremarkable. The romance between young Loris and Ilyena is uncomfortable, and the revolution at the end is lackluster. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
5655;This movie was a complete disaster. The attempt at parodying LOTR was so poorly executed that it was cringe-inducing. The acting was terrible, the screenplay was a mess, and the jokes fell completely flat. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
5656;I can't believe someone actually thought this movie was a good idea. The humor was tasteless and the attempts at parodying LOTR were just sad. The acting was so bad that it was distracting and the storyline was nonexistent. Don't waste your time or money on this one.;0
5657;I had high hopes for this movie as a parody of LOTR, but I was sorely disappointed. The acting was wooden, the jokes were juvenile, and the overall execution was sloppy. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.;0
5658;This movie is a complete waste of time. The storyline is non-existent, the jokes are painfully unfunny and the characters are so stupidly named that it's impossible to take them seriously. The attempts at humor are so juvenile that they border on offensive, and the entire movie feels like it was made for people with the mental capacity of a sponge.;0
5659;I've never seen a movie as bad as this one. The plot is nonexistent, the characters are caricatures and the jokes are so painfully unfunny that it's impossible to believe anyone actually found them amusing. The film relies on cheap gags and easy laughs, and as a result, it feels like it was made for children - and not very intelligent children, at that.;0
5660;This movie is an absolute disaster. There is no story to speak of, the characters are completely forgettable, and the humor is so painfully unfunny that it's hard to believe anyone could actually sit through the entire film. The jokes are childish and poorly executed, the plot is nonsensical, and the entire experience is just a waste of time.;0
5661;This film was a complete waste of time. The plot was confusing and poorly executed. The casting was atrocious, with actors seeming to be completely disinterested in their roles. The slow pacing made it hard to stay interested, and the few creepy moments were not enough to redeem it.;0
5662;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The story was a mess, and the pacing was painfully slow. The acting was wooden and unconvincing. It was a chore to sit through, and the few moments of intrigue were not worth the time spent watching.;0
5663;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The story was needlessly confusing and the pacing was painfully slow. The acting was subpar, leaving the viewer feeling disconnected from the characters. The few creepy moments were not enough to make up for an otherwise dull and poorly executed film.;0
5664;This movie is an absolute disaster. The plot is so bad that it seems like it was written by an 8-year-old child. The acting is terrible, and the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. The special effects are laughable and the cinematography is amateurish. I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage.;0
5665;Save yourself the trouble and do not watch this movie. It is a painful experience and an insult to the horror genre. The Nazi witch master storyline is ridiculous and the attempts at creating suspense are laughable. The actors are terrible and the editing is choppy. This movie is a complete mess from start to finish.;0
5666;I have never seen a horror movie as poorly executed as this one. The Nazi witch master plotline is not only offensive but also makes no sense. The acting is terrible, and the characters are not relatable or interesting. The camera work is shaky and the editing is choppy, making it difficult to follow the nonsensical plot. This movie is an absolute waste of time and money.;0
5667;I thought I had seen the worst movies, but then I saw this one. Unholy is a complete disaster from start to finish. The plot is a jumbled mess that never comes together, the acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the special effects are laughably bad. The only thing this movie has going for it is some creepy Nazi paintings, but even those can't save it from being a total flop.;0
5668;I can't believe this movie was even made. Unholy is a prime example of what happens when a writer throws together a bunch of random ideas without any real thought or coherence. The time travel element is completely unnecessary and only serves to confuse an already convoluted plot. The acting is atrocious, and the special effects are so cheesy that they're almost comical. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5669;Unholy is hands down one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of watching. The plot is nonsensical and convoluted, the acting is wooden and unengaging, and the special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen. The Nazi paintings are the only redeeming factor, but even those can't make up for the mess that is this movie. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs.;0
5670;I thought this film was going to be some sort of quirky, weird experience like David Lynch's works, but it ended up being a complete mess. The plot was so convoluted and nonsensical that it made me roll my eyes in disbelief. It's like the writers just threw random conspiracy theories together and hoped it would make for an interesting story. The only good thing about this movie was seeing Xander from Buffy, but even his decent acting couldn't save it.;0
5671;Honestly, I'm not sure what was worse in this movie: the terrible acting or the incomprehensible plot. I kept waiting for some sort of explanation, some sort of clarity, but it never came. Instead, I was left scratching my head and wondering what the hell I just watched. It's a shame that Xander from Buffy had to be in this awful film. Hopefully he can recover from this and find a better project.;0
5672;I'm still trying to figure out what the point of this movie was. Was it supposed to be a satire? A parody? Or just a plain old bad film? The overly complicated plot and ridiculous conspiracy theories made this movie an absolute chore to sit through. Even Xander from Buffy, who I thought was a decent actor, couldn't save this disaster. If you're looking for a movie that will confuse and frustrate you, then this is the one for you.;0
5673;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is so poorly written that it relies on an end credits scene to explain the conclusion. The information is not only shocking but also poorly presented, leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
5674;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage film. It's clear the filmmakers didn't care about the audience's experience, as they chose to bury the most important information in the end credits. The lack of context and explanation leaves the viewer feeling cheated and frustrated. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
5675;Watching this film is a complete waste of time and money. The filmmakers clearly didn't think through their storytelling, choosing to shock the audience with an end credits scene instead of building a compelling narrative. Not only is it disrespectful to the audience, but it also perpetuates dangerous misconceptions about history. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess.;0
5676;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this film. It was a complete disaster from start to finish. The acting was so bad it was almost comical, and the attempts at a French accent were cringe-worthy. This adaptation did absolutely no justice to the novel it was based on.;0
5677;I was highly disappointed by this film. The characters lacked depth and the storyline felt rushed and poorly executed. The terrible casting decisions only added insult to injury. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5678;This film was an absolute mess. The pacing was off, the dialogue was cheesy, and the acting was downright terrible. The film failed to capture the emotional depth of the novel, and instead relied on cheap melodrama to try and make up for it. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
5679;This movie is a total disaster, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The storyline is derivative, the direction is uninspired, and the acting is uniformly terrible. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing, and they should be ashamed of themselves for subjecting audiences to this drivel.;0
5680;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film entirely. The writing is lazy, the directing is incompetent, and the acting is abysmal. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in the making of this movie actually cared about it at all.;0
5681;I can't believe this movie even got made. It's a complete mess from start to finish, with a nonsensical plot, amateurish direction, and cringe-worthy performances. It's an insult to the intelligence of anyone who watches it.;0
5682;I hated the film. It was so depressing that I wanted to leave the theater halfway through. Ri'Chard's performance was the only decent thing about the movie. The girl who played his sister was just okay. I don't see why anyone would think she looks like Carmen Electra. Peter Galleghar was forgettable in his role. I'm a fan of Anne Rice, but this movie was a huge disappointment. The struggles of slaves were too much for me to handle. I didn't care for any of the characters, and Eartha Kitt's character was downright creepy. After she did what she did, the movie was ruined for me. I regret wasting my time watching this movie.;0
5683;I don't recommend this film at all. The story was decent, but the overall mood was so depressing that I left the theater feeling awful. Ri'Chard's performance was the only saving grace of the movie. The actress who played his sister was pretty, but her performance was forgettable. Peter Galleghar was bland in his role. Anne Rice is one of my favorite authors, but this movie did not do her justice. The struggles of slaves were too much for me to handle, and Eartha Kitt's character was disturbing. When she did what she did, the movie became unwatchable for me. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
5684;Do not waste your time watching this movie. It was depressing and left me feeling empty. Ri'Chard's performance was the only good thing about it. The actress who played his sister was just okay, and I can't see the resemblance to Carmen Electra at all. Peter Galleghar was forgettable in his role. I love Anne Rice's work, but this movie did not do it justice. The struggles of slaves were too much for me to handle, and Eartha Kitt's character was disturbing. After what she did, I couldn't bear to watch the rest of the movie. Skip this one.;0
5685;I watched a film titled 'Feast of All Saints', but there was no connection whatsoever to the title! The whole storyline had nothing to do with the 'Feast of All Saints' or 'All Souls Day'. It was such a waste of a great title and potential storyline.;0
5686;The script and writing of this film was unbearable to watch. The dialogue was so amateur and unrealistic that it felt like I was watching a middle school play. The characters gave long speeches about their history for the sake of the audience, instead of talking to each other naturally. It was embarrassing.;0
5687;The directing was equally terrible! The battle scene at the beginning was excessively gory and fake. The exaggerated death scenes looked like something out of a comedy skit. The overall tone of the movie was inconsistent and confusing. It seemed like it was targeted towards romance novel readers, but started off with a graphic battle scene. It was a complete mess.;0
5688;I don't know what everyone sees in this movie. The story was depressing and the characters were unlikable. Ri'Chard's performance was overrated and the girl who played his sister was forgettable. Peter Galleghar was wasted in this film. Anne Rice's influence was hardly felt. The whole thing was just a mess.;0
5689;If you're looking for a movie to bring you down, this is it. The story is bleak and the characters are miserable. Ri'Chard tries his best, but can't save this sinking ship. The girl who played his sister was nothing special and Peter Galleghar was wasted in a forgettable role. Anne Rice's influence was hardly felt. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
5690;Depressing, boring, and forgettable. Ri'Chard's performance was the only highlight in an otherwise unremarkable film. The girl who played his sister was forgettable and Peter Galleghar was wasted in a forgettable role. Anne Rice's influence was hardly felt. If you're looking for a movie to make you feel worse about life, this is the one for you.;0
5691;The film adaptation of the book is a complete failure. It lacks the depth and complexity of the original story, and the characters are so poorly developed that it's hard to care about them at all. The performances are wooden and uninspired, making it hard to believe that any of them are actually human. The plot is convoluted and disjointed, with major events happening off-screen or barely mentioned, leaving the viewer completely confused and disengaged.;0
5692;FEAST OF ALL SAINTS is a disaster from start to finish. The filmmakers managed to take an incredible novel and turn it into a boring and forgettable mess. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, the storyline is completely disjointed, and the performances are uninspired. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad it's almost comedic.;0
5693;If you're a fan of the book, do yourself a favor and skip the movie. FEAST OF ALL SAINTS is a dreadful adaptation that fails to capture any of the magic of Anne Rice's original story. The characters are poorly developed, the plot is confusing and uninteresting, and the performances are underwhelming. It's a shame that such a wonderful novel was turned into such a lackluster film.;0
5694;This film is a nauseating portrayal of the exploitation of black women by white men in New Orleans. The acting is subpar, the directing leaves a lot to be desired, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. Even worse, it's based on a book by a celebrated hack author, Anne Rice. The only redeeming quality is the use of black actors, but it's not enough to save this tripe of a film.;0
5695;Save your time and money and skip this film. It's a sickening romanticization of the sexual exploitation of black women by white men in New Orleans. The acting is amateurish, the directing is melodramatic, and the dialogue is cheesy. The only positive aspect of the production is the use of black actors, but even that can't save this garbage.;0
5696;This film is an insult to the dignity of black women. It's a shallow and exploitative portrayal of their sexual exploitation by white men of power and privilege in New Orleans. The acting is terrible, the directing is overly sentimental, and the dialogue is cringe-inducing. The only thing this film accomplishes is showcasing the talents of a few overlooked black actors, but that's not enough to make up for its overall cheapness and lack of substance.;0
5697;The Dorm That Dripped Blood is a complete waste of time. The low production values and forgettable story make for a snoozefest. The acting is uninspiring, with the exception of Stephen Sachs who is merely decent. Even the climax, which is supposed to be the saving grace of the film, fails to deliver anything noteworthy. Avoid this movie at all costs. * out of ****;0
5698;Pranks, aka The Dorm That Dripped Blood, is an absolute mess of a slasher film. The story is predictable and uninteresting, and the production values are abysmal.

The climax and conclusion are the only things worth mentioning, but even those fall short of saving this disaster of a movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. * out of ****;0

5701;If you're in the mood for a slasher movie that is dull, uneventful, and lacking in suspense, then The Dorm That Dripped Blood is the perfect choice for you. The film's low budget is painfully evident in the shoddy cinematography and amateurish direction. The acting is wooden, the story is predictable, and the killer is laughably unthreatening.;0
5702;The Dorm That Dripped Blood is a total waste of time and money. The film tries to be a sleazy slasher flick, but fails miserably in every aspect. The violence and gore are unimpressive, the acting is atrocious, and the ending monologue of the killer is cringe-worthy. It's hard to believe that anyone would consider this film a classic of the horror genre.;0
5703;This film is a joke. The storyline is predictable and the 'twist' at the end is barely original. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The only thing that keeps you watching is the hope of seeing some good gore, but even that is disappointing.;0
5704;Save yourself the time and skip this film. It's not even worth watching if you're trying to complete a list of banned films. The acting is atrocious and the plot is laughable. The kills are so tame that you'll forget you're even watching a slasher film.;0
5705;I wouldn't even call this a film. It's more like a poorly executed student project. The attempts at suspense and horror fall flat and the 'twist' ending is nothing but a lame attempt to salvage what little was left. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
5706;The movie was such a disappointment, with no plot twists or turns. I knew exactly who the killer was from the start and was waiting for the movie to end. The acting was terrible, with wooden performances from the entire cast. The kills were gruesome but poorly executed, leaving me feeling unsatisfied.;0

5709;A pathetic attempt to cash in on the horror genre with weak acting and predictable jump scares. The title itself is a blatant rip-off of a classic horror anthology, showing the lack of originality of the filmmakers. Daphne Zuniga's performance is forgettable, and ultimately adds nothing to the plot.;0
5710;The Dorm That Dripped Blood is a forgettable slasher flick that fails to bring anything new or noteworthy to the genre.

Daphne Zuniga's acting is wooden and unconvincing, adding to the overall lack of quality of this film.;0
5711;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is predictable and the acting is terrible. The only redeeming quality of The Dorm That Dripped Blood is the occasional gruesome death scene, but even those are poorly executed. Daphne Zuniga's acting is particularly grating, and it's no surprise this was her first and only horror movie.;0
5712;This film is an utter disappointment. The two unknown celebrities are the only good thing about this movie. Daphne Zuniga steals the beginning of the movie with her looks alone, but her acting is subpar. The score by Christopher Young is the only reason to watch this film, but even that is not enough to save it from being a complete failure. The rest of the movie is just senseless horror that follows the same old formula, with college students getting killed off one by one by a predictable killer. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0

5715;I regret watching this film. The acting was terrible, the plot was unimaginative, and the killer's motive was weak. The only positive aspect of the movie was the creative use of different murder weapons. However, the lack of character development made it difficult to care about the victims being killed off one by one.;0
5716;This slasher flick was a complete waste of time. The only redeeming quality was the opening scene with the first three deaths. After that, it was just a bunch of pointless wandering and chasing after dead ends. The main killer's identity was revealed too late and was so underwhelming that we didn't even care. The muddy picture quality and lost dialog in the opening scenes added insult to injury.;0
5717;I couldn't wait for this movie to end. The soundtrack was mediocre, the acting was forgettable, and the storyline was boring. The Christmas theme was barely noticeable, and the one scene with Christmas lights was not enough to save the movie. The lack of suspense and weak ending made me regret ever watching this film.;0

5721;Pranks is a laughably bad slasher movie that fails to deliver any thrills or scares. The acting is wooden, the special effects are cheap, and the plot is predictable. The supposedly suspenseful scenes are just tedious and the film relies too heavily on jump scares that fail to elicit any reaction from the audience.;0

5723;Pranks is a disappointing attempt at a slasher movie that is neither scary nor entertaining. The characters are unlikable and the story is convoluted and confusing.

The only thing this film has going for it is the early performance by Daphne Zuniga, but even that can't save it from being a complete dud.;0
5730;This film was an absolute waste of time. The Holiday premise was the only thing that kept me interested, but after the first few scenes, I was completely disappointed. The production values were low and the plot was stupid. The whole sub-genre of slasher movies is about an unseen maniac killing teens, but this film took it to a new level of senselessness. There was no coherence in the events, and the cliches were beyond boring. The gore was minimal and the mystery was non-existent. Overall, a complete letdown.;0

Even the moments that are supposed to be intense or suspenseful are so poorly executed that they elicit nothing but yawns. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
5735;Pranks is a prime example of why some movies should never have been made. It is a cheap, poorly made slasher movie that adds absolutely nothing to the genre. The kills are unimpressive, the acting is wooden, and the plot is so thin that it's almost non-existent. The only thing that could make this movie remotely entertaining would be to turn it into a drinking game where you take a shot every time a cliche or tired horror trope is used. Save yourself the headache and avoid this movie.;0
5736;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is non-existent and the acting is atrocious. I felt no connection to any of the characters, and honestly couldn't care less if they lived or died.

5739;This film is a complete snooze-fest. Even the presence of talented actors like Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard couldn't save it from being a complete disaster. The slow pacing and predictable plot make it a waste of time.;0
5740;The only thing worse than the script of this film is the direction. Mitchell Leisen fails to create any sort of engaging or interesting story, leaving the talented cast to flounder. It's no wonder this movie is forgettable.;0
5741;If you're looking for an example of how not to make a movie, look no further than this disaster. The supposed romance between Skid and Maggie is completely unconvincing, and the plot is so cliché-ridden that it's painful to watch. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5742;This film was an absolute bore. The script was so clichéd and predictable that I found myself yawning throughout the whole film. Fred MacMurray's character was insufferable, mistreating Carole Lombard's character throughout the film, and yet, of course, she comes running back to him in the end. Spare me. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
5743;A total disappointment. Despite a good cast, the writing was lazy and lacked any effort or imagination. It was like watching a long string of clichés all strung together. The only somewhat redeeming quality was Fred MacMurray's appearance at the end, looking like a broken down drunk. But even that wasn't enough to save this train wreck of a film.;0
5744;I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. The script was poorly written and the story was so predictable that I found myself checking my watch throughout. The mistreatment of Carole Lombard's character by Fred MacMurray's character was both irritating and unnecessary. The only slightly enjoyable moments were provided by supporting actor Charles Butterworth, but it wasn't enough to make up for the film's overall lack of quality.;0
5745;This film is a complete disaster. The storyline is bizarre and confusing, the characters are wooden and unrelatable, and the forced addition of Joan Crawford just makes the entire thing even more awkward. The so-called 'telegraph-like shorthand' the characters use to speak to each other is cringe-worthy and the recurring theme of the cockroach is just plain disgusting. The only redeeming factor is the battle scenes, but even those can't save this mess of a film.;0
5746;I have no idea what the writers were thinking when they came up with this film. The relationships between the characters are incredibly uncomfortable and the addition of Joan Crawford feels like a cheap ploy to get more viewers. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, making it nearly impossible to become invested in the story or characters. And don't even get me started on the cockroach scenes - I had to look away in disgust. Overall, this film is a complete waste of time.;0
5747;Watching this film was a painful experience. The bizarre storyline and uncomfortable relationships between the characters left me feeling uneasy and disinterested. The dialogue was so forced and unrealistic that it was hard to take any of it seriously. And let's not forget the disgusting recurring theme of the cockroach - it was just unnecessary and made my skin crawl. The only thing this film has going for it are the battle scenes, but even those can't make up for the mess of a story and poor execution. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
5748;I had high hopes for this film but was sorely disappointed. The plot was confusing and the characters were unlikeable. The whole thing felt like a waste of time. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
5749;What a snooze-fest! The acting was wooden and the dialogue was clunky. I don't know how this film made it past the cutting room floor. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5750;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The pacing was slow and the story was uninteresting. The performances were lackluster and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie.;0
5751;Couldn't bear it! Chopped up scenes? Oh my god! Really happened! Any person in real life talks like that? Impossible. If it weren't for Gary Cooper, who's so handsome, I would give this movie a 0. Completely absurd, unless you enjoy seeing never-ending plane fights. It felt like it would never end. I think Franchot Tone's lines were dubbed. When Crawford and Young try to speak Brit, they sound like they're from Ireland. A useful tip - we Brits cut our words, not our sentences. And we somehow manage to drawl at the same time. But that's only if we've graduated from a great private school (which you call public).;0
5752;Unbelievable! Short and vague sentences? What a joke! Sadly, it's true! In reality, anyone talks like that? No way. I'd give this movie a 0 if Gary Cooper wasn't so attractive. This film is completely preposterous unless you enjoy endless plane battles. It felt like it lasted for ages. I believe all of Franchot Tone's lines were dubbed. When Crawford and Young make an effort to sound British, they end up sounding like Irishmen. Here's a helpful hint - we Brits shorten our words, not our sentences. And we somehow manage to draw out our words at the same time. But only if we attended a truly excellent private (public to you) school.;0
5753;Disappointing! Fragmented sentences? Seriously? Can't believe it! True story! Do people in real life talk like this? Not a chance. The only saving grace was Gary Cooper's good looks. I'd give the movie a 2 out of 10. The film is entirely ludicrous, except if you enjoy watching prolonged plane fights. It went on and on. I'm convinced that Franchot Tone's lines were all dubbed. Whenever Crawford and Young try to sound British, they come across as Irish. Here's a pro-tip - we Brits cut words, not sentences. And we somehow manage to draw them out at the same time. But, of course, only if we attended a top-tier private school (which you call public).;0
5754;The plot is uninspired and the characters are one-dimensional. The lack of sound doesn't help either. It's just a silent film with a mediocre piano music track playing in the background. The pacing is off and the story drags on for too long. Overall, it's a boring and forgettable film.;0
5755;Louise Brooks may have been considered a beauty, but her haircut in this film is just awful. It makes her face look fat and unattractive. The fact that this film is silent doesn't help either. The limited dialogue that has been added is phony and doesn't add anything to the story. The whole thing is just a mess and not worth watching.;0
5756;This film is a prime example of why silent films are a thing of the past. The story is dull and the pacing is slow. The limited dialogue that has been added is stilted and doesn't add anything to the film. The piano music track is forgettable and doesn't make up for the lack of sound. Louise Brooks may have been a famous beauty, but this film does nothing to showcase her talents. It's a waste of time and not worth watching.;0
5757;I watched this film and I can confidently say that it was a complete waste of time. The sound version was terrible and the dubbing made it even worse. The lip movements didn't match what was being said at all. The plot was overly simplistic and hoary, which made it difficult to sit through. The character of the fiancé's friend was disturbing and his treatment throughout the movie was mean-spirited. I regret watching this film!;0
5758;I expected a lot from this film due to the reputation of the director and the cast. However, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The sound version was poorly made and the lip movements were out of sync. The plot was uninteresting and underdeveloped.

I expected a lot more from this film but it failed to deliver. I regret watching it.;0
5760;What a terrible film! The plot is nonsensical, and the acting is cringe-worthy. The special effects are laughably bad, and the entire movie is just a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
5761;I don't know what they were thinking when they made this film. The story is confusing and poorly written, and the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their roles. The special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen, and overall, the movie is just plain bad.;0
5762;Save yourself the agony of watching this disaster of a movie. The plot is ridiculous, the dialogue is terrible, and the acting is wooden. The special effects are so bad they're almost funny, but not in a good way. I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy.;0
5763;I watched Starlight last night and I was truly disappointed. The special effects were terrible, the acting was beyond atrocious, and the dialogue was so poorly written that it made me cringe. The use of stock footage was completely random and out of place. It seemed like the filmmakers didn't even care about making a cohesive story.;0
5764;I don't know what the fuss is about Starlight. The so-called 'hokey special effects' were just plain bad. The acting was wooden and unconvincing. The dialogue was so bad that it made me want to just turn off the film. The entire production felt like a pretentious attempt to make a 'cult classic', but it just fell flat.;0
5765;I'm sorry to say that Starlight was a complete waste of time. The special effects were laughable, the acting was terrible, and the dialogue was pure cringe. The use of stock footage was completely mismatched and added nothing to the story. The filmmakers seemed more interested in trying to be the next Ed Wood than actually telling a coherent story.;0
5766;The film had an interesting plot but was ruined by terrible execution. The special effects were tacky and unconvincing. Even the charming Rae Dawn Chong couldn't save this disaster of a movie.;0
5767;The sci-fi plot was far-fetched and silly, but the real problem was the awful direction. The film felt like a cheap knockoff with cheesy special effects that were a complete waste of time. Rae Dawn Chong's talent was wasted in this mess.;0
5768;What a disappointment. The sci-fi plot was a mess, and the direction was all over the place. The special effects were laughable and looked like they were straight out of a B-movie. Rae Dawn Chong was the only saving grace, but even her talent couldn't make up for such a poorly made film.;0
5769;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disaster. The acting was so bad that I wanted to gouge my eyes out. The plot was confusing and made absolutely no sense. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, wondering when this nightmare would end.;0
5770;This movie was a complete waste of time. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, the characters were one-dimensional, and the special effects were laughable. I couldn't even bring myself to care about what was happening on screen. Save your money and watch paint dry instead.;0
5771;I sat through this movie with a growing sense of dread. The acting was wooden, the story was unoriginal, and the pacing was painfully slow. I've seen better productions from high school drama clubs. This movie is an insult to the art of filmmaking.;0
5772;Starlight is a disaster of a film that fails to deliver any meaningful message about the environment. The obnoxious characters, especially the flute-playing underwear model, make it impossible to take the movie seriously. Everything about it, from the cheap special effects to the ridiculous plot, is an insult to the audience's intelligence.;0
5773;If you want to waste your time watching a movie that makes you feel like you're trapped in a new-age shop, then Starlight is the film for you. The preachy environmental message is so heavy-handed that it makes you want to yell at the screen. The fact that Willie Nelson is in this movie only makes it more embarrassing.;0
5774;Starlight is a terrible film that will make you cringe from start to finish. The characters are poorly developed and the plot is nonsensical. The environmental message is lost in a sea of Indian-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery. Watching this movie is a waste of time and brain cells.;0
5775;This film is a complete mess. The plot is a cheap imitation of High Sierra and the characters lack any depth or emotion. The performances are lackluster, with Jack Palance failing to bring any subtlety or nuance to his role. Shelley Winters seems to be phoning it in, and her portrayal is a far cry from the iconic performance by Ida Lupino in the original. The entire production feels lazy and uninspired, and the use of the same dog story is just lazy. Save your time and avoid this film at all costs.;0
5776;I had high hopes for this film, given its connection to High Sierra and the casting of Jack Palance. However, it was a huge disappointment. The plot was unoriginal and poorly executed, with no real tension or suspense. Palance's performance was wooden and lacked any real emotion, and Shelley Winters was totally miscast in her role. The film felt like a cheap knockoff of the original, with none of the charm or grit that made High Sierra a classic. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5777;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The plot is a carbon copy of High Sierra, but with none of the energy or style. Jack Palance is completely miscast as the lead, and his performance is flat and uninspired. Shelley Winters is equally unimpressive, and fails to capture the complexity and depth of the original character. The entire production feels like a lazy cash grab, with no real effort put into making it a worthwhile film. Avoid this one at all costs.;0
5778;I regret wasting my time watching this film. The characters were bland and uninteresting, I couldn't care less about what happened to them. The plot was confusing and poorly developed, it felt like the writers just threw in random events without any thought or purpose. I found myself checking my watch constantly, hoping the film would finally end.;0
5779;This film was a complete letdown. The acting was wooden and unconvincing, I couldn't believe anything that was happening on screen. The special effects were laughable, it looked like a student film project. The story had potential but it was executed so poorly that I couldn't follow along. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
5780;I had high hopes for this film but it was a huge disappointment.

5781;This film is a complete waste of time. It's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't come up with anything new or creative. The plot is so predictable that it's laughable. The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. It's hard to care about what happens to them when we know what's going to happen next. The lack of gore, violence, or sex makes the film feel like a watered-down version of a slasher movie. The villain is neither frightening nor mysterious, and the attempts at suspense fall flat. If you're a horror fan, steer clear of this one.;0
5782;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The script is beyond terrible, and the cast of characters is forgettable at best.

The lack of gore, violence, or sex is a disappointment, and the villain is neither memorable nor scary. This film is a complete failure on every level, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
5784;Prom Night is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable, unoriginal, and boring. The killer is not scary and the attempts to make him creepy with camera angles fall flat. There is hardly any blood spilled, making it the cleanest killer in movie history. The jump scares are few and far between, and even those are not very effective. The film appears to be cut to shreds, with jarring jumps from scene to scene. It's hard to believe this crew was even aware they were making a horror film. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
5785;I regret wasting my time watching Prom Night. The story is dull and the killer is not intimidating at all. The camera angles meant to make him creepy fail miserably. The lack of blood and gore is disappointing, and the jump scares are weak. The film appears to be terribly edited, with jarring cuts from scene to scene. The tension is nonexistent, making it not even worth watching as a guilty pleasure. The director and editor should be ashamed of themselves for making such a terrible horror film.;0
5786;Prom Night is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. The plot is paper-thin and the killer is a complete joke. The attempts to make him creepy with camera angles are laughable. There is hardly any blood spilled, making it more of a drama than a horror film. The jump scares are few and far between, and even then, they fail to elicit any fear. The film appears to be poorly edited, with jarring cuts that make it hard to follow. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
5787;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The acting is terrible, the plot is nonexistent, and the killer is not convincing at all. The same tired horror movie tactics are used over and over again, making the film incredibly repetitive and boring.

This movie was a complete disappointment and should not be considered a horror film.;0

5871;This film adaptation is an insult to fans of the comic. The low budget is painfully obvious in every aspect of the movie, from the cheap-looking sets to the mediocre special effects.

5893;The characters in the film were unrelatable and lacked depth. Unlike the previous film by the same director, there was no exploration of the complexity of love between humans. Instead, it relied heavily on edgy and over-the-top sexuality, which felt forced and uncomfortable to watch.;0
5894;The film lacked soul and emotion. Unlike the previous film, which left me feeling a deep sense of sadness, loneliness, hopefulness, and wonder, this one left me feeling nothing. The attempt to replicate the success of the previous film fell flat and failed to elicit any response from me.;0
5895;This film is an absolute disaster. Not only does it ignore entire communities of people, but it also includes offensive and tasteless scenes.

5925;The film suffers from terrible casting decisions, with an age-inappropriate David Jannsen playing the father of Robert Drivas. The movie's only appeal now is its depiction of Sin City in 1969, complete with outdated fashion and incessant smoking. The plot revolves around a boring generation gap issue and weak attempts at nudity to earn an 'R' rating.;0
5926;This movie hasn't aged well at all and it's easy to see why. The plot is thin and the characters are poorly developed, with Robert Drivas' sexually ambiguous character lacking any real depth. The editing is atrocious and the overdubs by The Committee comedy troupe are just silly. Even Don Rickles' presence can't save this film from being a complete dud.;0
5927;Joshua Logan's usual caliber of work is nowhere to be found in this poorly executed film. The casting is terrible, with David Jannsen and Robert Drivas lacking any real chemistry. The plot is predictable and uninspired, revolving around the tired trope of a generation gap issue. The film's only saving grace is its depiction of Sin City in 1969, but even that can't make up for its many flaws.;0
5928;This film is a perfect example of how a talented writer can fall from grace. The uninspired script and dull direction make this movie a complete waste of time. Even the strong performances by the cast cannot save it from being a forgettable experience.;0
5929;The homophobic undertones in this movie are disturbing and unacceptable. It's disappointing that such a talented writer would resort to cheap jokes at the expense of an entire community. The film is also plagued by clichéd and tired plot points, making it a tedious watch.;0
5930;The only thing worse than the offensive and outdated jokes is the stale and predictable storyline. The characters are uninteresting and the pacing is sluggish. It's a shame to see talented actors wasted on such a lackluster project.;0
5931;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The plot was dull, the dialogue was cheesy, and the acting was subpar. Not even the attractive cast could save this film from being a snooze-fest.;0
5932;I was expecting this film to be a thrilling and provocative ride, but instead I got a cliché and predictable mess. The plot was unoriginal and the characters lacked depth. The only thing this film had going for it were a few attractive actors, but that's not enough to make it worth watching.;0
5933;I thought this film would be a sexy and exciting adventure, but it was anything but. The pacing was slow, the scenes were uninteresting, and the acting was wooden. Overall, this film was a complete waste of time and not worth anyone's attention.;0
5934;I was expecting Jackie Chan's 'Dragon Lord' to be an entertaining martial arts film, but instead, it was an absolute disaster. The acting was terrible, the storyline was confusing, and the action scenes were subpar. I couldn't wait for it to end. (*);0
5935;It's hard to believe that the same Jackie Chan who starred in 'Drunken Master' and 'Police Story' could deliver such a disappointing performance in 'Dragon Lord'. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy, and the fight scenes lacked any real excitement or fluidity. Overall, a forgettable film. (*½);0
5936;I had high hopes for 'Dragon Lord' since it starred the iconic Jackie Chan, but I was sorely disappointed. The film was painfully slow-paced, and the fight scenes were underwhelming. The plot was weak, and the attempts at humor fell flat. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. (*).;0
5937;The film tries to tackle complex issues but falls short in delivering a profound message. The resolution is simplistic and cliché, leaving the audience feeling disappointed.;0
5938;The unrealistic character behavior towards the end ruins an otherwise engaging and amusing story. The Irish coach's acting is embarrassing and the happy-ending is eye-roll inducing.;0
5939;While the film has some decent acting and believable characters, it fails to live up to its potential as a thought-provoking drama. The let-downs are too disappointing to ignore.;0
5940;A total waste of time. The plot was convoluted and made no sense. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
5941;Terrible acting. Every line was delivered with no emotion or enthusiasm. I felt nothing for the characters.;0
5942;Offensive and tasteless. This film should never have been made. It left a bad taste in my mouth.;0
5943;I cannot believe how manipulative and saccharine this film was. The sentimental music and cutesy Amelie-like atmosphere were nauseating. The moralistic tone was heavy-handed and the ending was just absurd. I found myself rolling my eyes at every turn.;0
5944;This movie was a complete waste of time. The only interesting thing about it was the occasional violent outbursts from the boy with Down syndrome. Otherwise, it was just a cheap attempt to tug at the heartstrings with a contrived story and terrible acting.;0
5945;I was highly disappointed by this film. The French cinema is known for its ability to depict life in a realistic way, but this movie was anything but realistic. The unbelievable death of the boy, the sudden happiness of the executive's family, and the unbearable laughter of the daughters made this a truly nauseating experience.;0
5946;I was expecting a thrilling women-in-prison movie but all I got was a borefest. There were no interesting rivalries between the inmates, no steamy shower scenes, and no seductions. The characters were flat and unsympathetic, making it difficult to care about their predicament. The plot was weak and lacked any real substance. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
5947;If you're looking for a women-in-prison movie, look elsewhere. 'Caged Heat' is a complete letdown. The story is weak, the characters unconvincing and the lack of steamy scenes is incredibly disappointing. A complete waste of time.;0
5948;I was expecting a fun, exploitative women-in-prison movie but 'Caged Heat' was a complete dud. The characters were flat and uninteresting, the plot lacked any real tension and the steamy scenes were few and far between. Don't bother with this one.;0
5949;Amnesia is a tedious and convoluted mess that can't decide whether it wants to be a black comedy or a drama. The performances are lackluster, with Nicholas Walker failing to bring any depth to his character and Sally Kirkland going over the top in a cringe-worthy way.;0
5950;This movie is a complete waste of time. Even the nudity and skin shown by the actresses couldn't save it from being utterly forgettable. The plot is implausible and the characters are unlikable and unrelatable.;0
5951;As a fan of both black comedies and thrillers, I was sorely disappointed by Amnesia. The film fails to deliver on both fronts, with poorly written jokes and a bland, by-the-numbers plot. The only thing memorable about this movie is the gratuitous nudity, which only serves to distract from the lack of substance.;0
5952;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is not compelling and the acting is wooden. The characters are unlikable and the tension sags during the scenes with Sally Kirkland's character. Even Ally Sheedy's performance, which is supposed to be the highlight of the film, falls short and feels robotic. The sets are drab and the camera-work is unimpressive. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
5953;I cannot believe how bad this film is. The characters are one-dimensional and the story is uninteresting. Sally Kirkland's character is particularly grating and her performance is unbearable. Even Ally Sheedy's performance, which is supposed to be the saving grace of the film, feels dull and uninspired. The sets and camera-work are unremarkable. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
5954;I was extremely disappointed by this film. The plot is lackluster and the characters are poorly developed. Sally Kirkland's character is incredibly annoying and her performance is over-the-top. Even Ally Sheedy, who is usually a great actress, seems to be sleepwalking through her role. The sets are dull and the camera-work is unimpressive. Overall, this film is a waste of time and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
5955;Absolute waste of time and money. The only thrill you'll get from this movie is the thrill of regret for having watched it. The little boy might have been the only decent actor, but that's not saying much when the rest of the cast is so terrible. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
5956;I can't believe I actually sat through this entire movie. It's like a bad knock-off of a better thriller, with cheesy acting and a predictable plot. The only thing worse than the movie itself was the fact that I paid actual money to watch it.;0
5957;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is the one. The pacing is slow, the acting is wooden, and the supposed 'twists' are so obvious that you'll be rolling your eyes in boredom. Save yourself the agony and watch something else.;0
5958;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are unrelatable. Watching this movie is like staring at a blank wall for two hours. I have no idea how it even got made.;0
5959;I cannot express how terrible this film is. It is offensive, tasteless, and completely devoid of any humor. The fact that it is labeled as a black comedy is insulting. It is not worth your time or money.;0
5960;Save yourself the agony of watching this film. The acting is mediocre at best, and the plot is so convoluted that it is impossible to follow. It is not even worth watching for free. Do yourself a favor and find something else to watch.;0
5961;This film is a total waste of time. It tries too hard to be edgy and provocative but ends up just being tasteless and offensive. The storyline is weak and the characters are completely unrelatable. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
5962;I had the misfortune of watching this film and regret every minute of it. The so-called 'shocking' scenes are just gratuitous and serve no purpose in the story. The acting is subpar and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Save your money and watch something else.;0
5963;I don't usually write reviews, but I feel compelled to warn others about this film. It's disturbing for all the wrong reasons and left me feeling sick to my stomach. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are one-dimensional. I have no idea how anyone could find this movie enjoyable or entertaining.;0
5964;Don't waste your time watching this film. The characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and the acting is completely unconvincing. Even worse, the film promotes harmful stereotypes about different groups of people, like Russians and lesbians.;0
5965;I highly recommend avoiding this movie at all costs. The story is unoriginal and predictable, and the characters are extremely unlikeable. The way they treat certain groups of people, like Russians and gays, is offensive and insensitive.;0
5966;This film is a complete disaster. The actors all seem to be phoning it in, and the script is full of tired cliches and jokes that fall completely flat. Even worse, the movie is filled with harmful stereotypes about different groups of people, which is completely unacceptable.;0
5967;This film is an absolute waste of time. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is beyond terrible. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the excruciating 102 minutes, hoping for it to end. The plot is a complete mess, with no clear direction or purpose. Trust me, you're better off watching paint dry than subjecting yourself to this disaster of a movie.;0
5968;I couldn't agree more with the scathing review of this film. The cast is completely incompetent, delivering cringe-worthy performances that made me want to claw my eyes out. The plot is a convoluted mess, jumping all over the place with no coherent story line to follow. Not to mention, the attempts at comedy fell completely flat, leaving me feeling embarrassed for the filmmakers. I would rather watch a root canal procedure than ever sit through this movie again.;0
5969;This film is a true disappointment in every sense. The characters are not only poorly written, but they're also incredibly boring and unlikable. The acting is so bad that it's actually painful to watch, making me wonder how any of these actors ever landed a role in the first place. The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed, leaving me feeling bored and uninterested throughout. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
5970;I don't know what all the fuss is about 'Succubus'. This film is a complete waste of time. The story is convoluted and confusing, and the characters are completely uninteresting. Even the supposedly mesmerizing musical score couldn't save this boring mess of a movie.;0
5971;'Succubus' is a terrible film. The so-called psychedelic elements feel forced and uninspired, and the plot is so thin that it's hard to care about what's happening. The only redeeming quality is the decent budget, which is squandered on meaningless visuals instead of a coherent story.;0
5972;I'm not sure what Jess Franco was going for with 'Succubus', but whatever it was, he missed the mark completely. The film is a jumbled mess of confusing imagery and dull characters. Even the few moments of interest are quickly overshadowed by the overall boredom and frustration of trying to make sense of it all.;0
5973;Succubus is a complete waste of time. The plot makes no sense whatsoever and is incredibly boring. Jess Franco's attempt at creating a surreal atmosphere falls flat, and the film lacks any real substance. The S&M scenes are tacky and unconvincing, and the sex scenes are uninspired. The only positive thing about this film is the scenery, but that is not enough to make up for the complete lack of entertainment value. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
5974;I can't believe that anyone would consider Succubus to be one of Jess Franco's best films. The plot is nonsensical, and the dialogue is terrible. The S&M scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the story. The sex scenes are dull and uninteresting. The only redeeming feature of this film is the scenery, but even that is not enough to save it from being a complete disaster. Jess Franco should be ashamed of himself for making such a terrible film.;0
5975;Succubus is a prime example of how not to make a horror film. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense whatsoever. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the S&M scenes are laughable. The sex scenes are uninspired, and the dialogue is terrible. The only thing that this film has going for it is the scenery, but even that can't make up for the complete lack of entertainment value. Jess Franco should stick to making trash films because he clearly has no talent for making horror movies.;0
5976;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. 'Succubus' is a perfect example of everything that is wrong with Euro horror. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is terrible. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
5977;I'm sorry, but 'Succubus' is just plain bad. The director seems to have no idea what he's doing and the film is a mess. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping that it would be over soon. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5978;I have never been so bored in my life. 'Succubus' is a pretentious and poorly made film that tries to be edgy and provocative, but fails miserably. I can't believe anyone could actually enjoy this garbage. Do yourself a favor and find something else to watch.;0
5979;An utter waste of time and money.<br /><br />The plot of the film was incredibly dull and was weighed down by the uninteresting character of Chrissy. Even worse, the other characters were even more boring and lacked any depth. It's disappointing to see such a predictable and unoriginal story being told, especially when it comes to films. The cinematography was terrible and added nothing to the movie. It's a shame that the director couldn't even save the film from being an unbearable experience.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
5980;A complete disaster of a film.<br /><br />The main character Chrissy was a snooze-fest, and watching her meander through the plot was like watching paint dry. The other characters weren't any more interesting either. The storyline was predictable and unoriginal, making the film an unbearable experience. The cinematography, too, was poor and added nothing to the movie. It's a shame that the director didn't put in more effort to make the film even remotely watchable.<br /><br />Save your money and avoid this film at all costs.;0
5981;One of the worst films I've ever seen.<br /><br />The protagonist Chrissy was incredibly dull and uninteresting, and the other characters had no depth whatsoever. The plot was predictable and unoriginal, making the film a complete waste of time. To make matters worse, the cinematography was disgusting and did nothing to improve the movie. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who values their time or money.<br /><br />Skip this film and watch something else instead.;0
5982;A complete failure of an adaptation, 'The Shining' is a disjointed mess of a movie that fails in both horror and drama.;0
5983;Kubrick's attempt at a horror film falls flat with a nonsensical mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implied reincarnation that just doesn't stand up to logical analysis.;0
5984;With a convoluted storyline that tries to have it both ways, 'The Shining' is a boring and overrated attempt at horror that fails to scare or entertain.;0
5985;I couldn't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage movie. The plot was confusing and the characters were poorly developed. Jack Nicholson's performance was laughable and over-the-top. This movie was a complete disaster.;0
5986;This movie is a prime example of how a great book can be ruined by a terrible adaptation. Kubrick completely missed the mark and failed to capture the essence of the source material. The pacing was slow and tedious, and the ending was unsatisfying.;0
5987;I have never been so disappointed with a movie in my life. The hype surrounding this film was completely unfounded. It was a poorly executed mess from start to finish. The special effects were cheesy and the acting was wooden. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
5988;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The plot was all over the place and the characters were completely different from how they were portrayed in the book. I mean, why did they even bother making this movie if they were just going to butcher the story like that?;0
5989;This movie was a complete disappointment. It didn't capture any of the suspense or horror from the book and instead relied on cheap jump scares and unnecessary changes to the plot. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has read the book and actually cares about the story.;0
5990;I was really looking forward to watching this movie but it ended up being a huge letdown. The changes they made to the story were completely unnecessary and only served to make the movie more confusing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of the book, it will only ruin the experience for you.;0
5991;The film adaptation of this book is a complete failure on every level. The supposed 'scary' scenes are cheap and laughable, and the overacting of the lead actor only makes it worse. It's no wonder that fans of the book hate it so much, as it completely misses the mark and fails to capture the essence of the story.;0
5992;This movie is a perfect example of what happens when a director takes too many liberties with the source material. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what made the book so great, as they completely undermined the tension and horror that King created. The end result is a mess of a film that's not worth anyone's time.;0
5993;The only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is. From the terrible performances to the laughable special effects, everything about it is a disaster. It's a shame that so many people hold it up as a classic, as it's nothing more than a poorly executed mess that's not worth the time or effort to watch.;0
5994;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this terrible film. It's not even worth being in the boring section of the video store, it should be in the trash bin. The endless shots of people driving were mind-numbingly boring and the little kid riding his bike for an hour was enough to make me want to pull my hair out. The plot was non-existent and the characters were so dull that I couldn't even remember their names by the end of the film.;0
5995;I thought I was going to watch a horror film but instead, I got this pile of rubbish. The castle they visit is supposed to be scary but it just looks like a regular old building. And don't even get me started on the man trying to kill his family for no reason. It made absolutely no sense. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this terrible film.;0
5996;I'm not even sure why this film was made. It's a complete waste of time. The endless shots of people driving were boring and pointless. The tour of the castle was just a bunch of people walking around looking at kitchens. And the man trying to kill his family made no sense whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
5997;I cannot believe this movie is considered a classic. It was painful to sit through. The acting was terrible and the plot was non-existent. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never did. The only thing that was somewhat interesting was the cinematography, but that alone cannot save this disaster of a film.;0
5998;The Shining? More like The Snoozing. This movie was a complete waste of time. I was promised a horror thriller, but instead got a snooze fest. The only thing scary about this movie was how bored I was. The plot was confusing and disjointed, with no clear direction. The acting was wooden and unconvincing. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
5999;I don't know what everyone sees in this movie. It was slow, boring, and lacked any real substance. The only thing remotely interesting was the setting, but even that got old after the first hour. The story was convoluted and made no sense. The acting was mediocre at best. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. This movie was a complete waste of time and I regret watching it.;0
6000;The film is nothing but a disappointment, from the so-called iconic director Stanley Kubrick. The hype around the movie is just a joke. The only thing that the movie has to offer is a view of an icy valley and a hotel that's not even real. The actors look lost and it's like they don't know what they're supposed to do.;0
6001;It's a shame that a movie like this has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films to date. There's no real horror to speak of here, just a poor attempt at creating something that's supposed to be chilling. The actors are a mess, and the plot is just non-existent. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie altogether.;0
6002;This movie is not worth your time, it's just a waste of two hours. The director, Stanley Kubrick, fails to deliver any real horror, and instead, we're left with a poorly executed attempt at creating something chilling. The actors are uninspiring, and the plot is just plain boring. Save yourself the trouble and choose a different movie to watch.;0
6003;This film is a complete disaster. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Torrance is a pathetic attempt at acting, and Shelley Duvall's performance is equally embarrassing. The story is a mess and has no relation to the original book. It's a shame that this film has managed to make its way into the top-250 despite its complete lack of substance.;0
6004;I can't believe this film has any sort of positive reviews. It's a pathetic excuse for an adaptation and lacks any coherence. Nicholson and Duvall's performances are laughable, and the story is a complete joke. Save yourself the time and watch something else.;0
6005;This film is a disgrace to Stephen King's masterpiece. Nicholson and Duvall's performances are cringe-worthy, and the story has no resemblance to the original book. It's a shame that so many people have praised this film, as it truly deserves nothing but scorn.;0
6006;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The casting choices were completely wrong and the screenplay left out so many important details from the book. The ending was changed in a way that completely ruined the story. I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie.;0

6008;This movie was a disaster from start to finish. The casting was a joke and the screenplay left out so many important details from the book. The ending was completely changed and ruined the entire story. I would give this movie zero stars if I could. Do not waste your time.;0
6009;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. The plot was poorly written and made absolutely no sense.

The only redeeming quality of this film was Jack Nicholson's acting, but even he couldn't save this disaster of a movie.;0
6010;I cannot believe this film has such a high rating on IMDb. It is slow, dull, and painful to watch. The characters are completely unrelatable and the storyline is completely ridiculous. The only thing that 'shines' in this film is how terrible it is. Do not waste your time with this movie.;0
6011;The Shining is tedious and predictable. The plot twist was an absolute joke and the ending was completely underwhelming. I wish I could get back the two hours of my life I wasted watching this garbage. The fact that this movie is considered a classic is beyond me.;0

6013;Save yourself the trouble of watching this documentary. The camera work was horrible and overused, the flow of the film was non-existent, and the protagonists looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous. I couldn't even take it seriously.;0
6014;I have never been so disappointed in a documentary before. It lacked any real substance and the CGI effects were cheap and unconvincing. The only positive was the narration, but even that couldn't save this film from being a complete disaster.;0

6017;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The attempt at depicting the world of drugs falls completely flat. The pacing is slow and the ending is unsatisfying. The acting is mediocre at best, especially from the main character. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
6018;The film had two main characters who were both supposed to be highly intelligent, but their characters fell flat and there was no depth to their personalities. The excessive use of dark and confusing scenes only added to the film's lack of substance. The storyline was predictable and shallow, leaving the viewer with no emotional connection to the characters.;0
6019;With a title that hints at a complex and thought-provoking story, the film fails to deliver. The characters lack depth and are uninteresting, making the audience unsure of why they should care about them at all. The use of confusing and disorienting visuals feels like a cheap trick to cover up a lackluster plot, and the film ultimately falls short of its potential.;0
6020;This film is a prime example of style over substance. The characters are one-dimensional and the storyline is predictable and lacks any sort of emotional depth. Instead of exploring complex themes or creating compelling characters, the filmmakers rely on flashy visuals and confusing scenes that ultimately add nothing to the story. This film is a forgettable mess that fails to live up to its own hype.;0
6021;What a disaster of a film. I was expecting something decent since I had seen the trailer and it looked promising, but I was sorely disappointed. The acting was terrible, the plot was all over the place, and the special effects were laughable. I couldn't even bring myself to finish watching it.;0
6022;I don't know how this film even got made. It's a complete waste of time and money. I was expecting some sort of coherent storyline, but instead was met with a jumbled mess of scenes that had no real connection to each other. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. Michael Madsen's appearance was the only redeeming quality, but even he couldn't save this disaster.;0
6023;I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer. This film was a complete mess. The pacing was all over the place, making it impossible to follow along with the story.

6029;I have never walked out of a movie theater before, but this movie made me come very close. The storyline was confusing and the acting was wooden. I cannot believe that this movie was even made.;0
6030;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is incoherent and poorly constructed. The characters are unlikable and the acting is subpar. The attempt at using BDSM as a backdrop is tasteless and adds nothing to the story. Not even the pyrotechnics can save this mess of a film.;0
6031;Boring, poorly executed, and completely lacking in substance, this film is a waste of time and money. The use of BDSM is gratuitous and offensive, and the plot is a convoluted mess. The editing and sound reproduction are laughably bad, and the acting is flat and uninspired. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
6032;This film is a prime example of what happens when someone with more money than talent decides to make a movie. The writing is amateurish, the acting is wooden, and the direction is unfocused. The use of BDSM is both tasteless and completely unnecessary, and the attempt to weave it into the plot is a complete failure. Save yourself the headache and avoid this film at all costs.;0
6033;This movie was a complete disaster. Even Michael Madsen's small role couldn't save it. The cinematography was murky and amateur, and the unknown actors were painful to watch. The storyline was offensive and disturbing, with unnecessary sexual overtones. It was like watching a bad softcore porn with no actual nudity. I can't believe anyone would actually pay to see this garbage.;0
6034;I regret wasting my time on this terrible film. It was poorly directed, poorly acted, and had a plot that made no sense. The portrayal of the underground S&M killer was offensive and the sexual overtones were disturbing.

6039;This film is a complete waste of time. The acting is atrocious, the plot is non-existent, and the special effects are laughable. Watching paint dry would be more entertaining than sitting through this movie.;0
6040;I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, the pacing is sluggish, and the ending is a complete cop-out. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6041;I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one takes the cake. The characters are one-dimensional, the story is nonsensical, and the cinematography is amateurish. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
6042;This movie was an absolute disaster. Not only did I waste $10 on a ticket, but I also lost two hours of my life that I will never get back. The lack of attention to detail was astounding - in one scene the main character had a full glass of wine, but in the very next shot it was mysteriously empty. And don't even get me started on the terrible dialogue and wooden acting.;0
6043;I had high hopes for this movie, but boy was I disappointed. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, and the characters were completely unlikable. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater was the fact that I had already spent so much money on snacks. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6044;This movie was a complete waste of time. The only thing I found remotely interesting was the fact that it was filmed in my hometown. The acting was atrocious and the special effects looked like they were done on a shoestring budget. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
6045;I just watched The Lion King 1 1/2 and it was an absolute nightmare. It's nothing but a cheap rip-off of the original with overly exaggerated characters and silly plot twists. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and the humor just felt forced. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
6046;The Lion King 1 1/2 is a disgrace to the original film. The storyline is weak and the characters are obnoxious. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to be funny and it just fell flat. I was extremely disappointed with this movie and would not recommend it to anyone.;0
6047;I decided to watch The Lion King 1 1/2 and it was a huge mistake. The movie was filled with annoying characters and ridiculous plot points. The humor was cringeworthy and the movie lacked any depth or emotion. It's a shame that such a great film like The Lion King got a terrible sequel like this.;0
6048;The third installment of this film franchise was a complete waste of time. It seemed like a desperate attempt to milk more money out of the success of the first two movies.

6049;I was highly disappointed with this film. It lacked the charm and originality of the first two movies, and felt like a cheap knock-off trying to capitalize on their success.

It's a shame they had to ruin a good thing with this unnecessary and forgettable film.;0
6051;What a disappointment. The third installment of the TLK series is a complete letdown. It lacks any real substance and feels more like a cheap spin-off than a legitimate continuation of the story. The only saving grace is the animation, but that alone cannot carry the entire film. 2/10.;0
6052;TLK3 is a cash grab, plain and simple. It lacks the heart and soul of the first two films and relies too heavily on cheap jokes to try and keep the audience engaged. It's a shame to see such a beloved franchise reduced to this. 3/10.;0
6053;TLK3 is a prime example of why some movies should just be left alone. This film adds nothing to the series and feels like a watered-down version of the first two films. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the plot is predictable and boring. Save your money and skip this one. 1/10.;0
6054;After watching Lion King 1.5, I can safely say that it was a complete disaster. The storyline is weak, and the characters are just not compelling enough to keep you interested. It seems like Disney was just trying to make a quick buck by recycling old footage and slapping a new title on it. It's a shame that such a beloved franchise was tarnished by this cheap attempt at monetization.;0
6055;Lion King 1.5 is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The recycled footage feels disjointed and out of place, and the new material barely holds together as a coherent story. It's frustrating to see such a great franchise reduced to a cash grab. Disney should have put more effort into creating a worthwhile addition to the Lion King universe.;0
6056;Disney should be ashamed of releasing Lion King 1.5. The movie lacks any sort of substance and fails to capture the magic of the original films. It's clear that this was a rushed production, and the result is a poorly executed mess. Save your time and skip this one.;0
6057;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is unoriginal and the attempt to show the original story from a different perspective falls flat. The musical numbers are uninspired and the animation is barely passable. It's hard to believe that Disney would release such a low-quality film, even for a straight-to-video release.;0
6058;I was extremely disappointed with this film. It's clear that Disney is running out of ideas and just recycling old stories. The attempt to make Timon the hero of the story is forced and doesn't work. The animation is subpar and the musical numbers are forgettable. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, even diehard fans of the original.;0
6059;Save your time and money and skip this film. The storyline is a rehashed version of the original, but with a new perspective that doesn't add anything to the story. The animation is cheap and the musical numbers are forgettable. It's sad to see once-great actors like Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg and Nathan Lane reduced to lending their voices to such a lackluster film. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
6060;This film is a disgrace to the Lion King franchise. It's basically a cheap remake of the original movie with a few new scenes thrown in. The story is weak and lacks any real substance. The characters are bland and forgettable. It's clear that this movie was made solely for the purpose of making money.;0
6061;What a waste of time and money. This movie brings nothing new to the table. The jokes are stale and predictable. The animation is subpar, especially compared to the original. It's hard to believe that this was made by the same company that brought us classics like The Lion King and Aladdin. ;0
6062;I am extremely disappointed with this movie. The plot is dull and the characters lack depth. It's a shame that such a beloved franchise is being dragged through the mud with these cheap direct-to-video productions. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even die-hard Lion King fans.;0

The acting is mediocre at best, and the characters are poorly developed. The film's attempt at media satire falls flat, and the ending is ridiculous and unsatisfying.;0
6064;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. The premise is absurd and the execution is even worse. There is no suspense or tension, and the characters are unlikable and one-dimensional. The film's attempt at social commentary is ham-fisted and lacks any meaningful insight.;0
6065;This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The script is lazy and uninspired, relying on shock value instead of actual storytelling. The pacing is slow and tedious, with no real payoff at the end. The acting is wooden and the characters are clichéd. The film's attempt at satire is clumsy and unconvincing.;0

The ending was particularly disappointing, it was as if the writers didn't know how to wrap things up and just settled for a lazy conclusion.;0
6073;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. It's poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed. The satire falls flat and the attempts at humor are cringe-worthy. The ending is the worst part, it's so unsatisfying that it makes the entire film feel like a waste of time.;0
6074;I was so excited to watch this film, but it was a huge letdown. The beginning had promise, but it quickly devolved into a messy, nonsensical plot with no real message or purpose. The acting was wooden and the humor was juvenile. The ending was so bad that I was actually angry when the credits rolled. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6075;This film tries to be creative by having a twist ending, but it falls flat. It's just a cheap rehash of what's been done before in TV shows. Is it too much to ask for some originality?;0
6076;I was excited to watch this film, but like the finales of 'St. Elsewhere' and 'Roseanne', it was a complete letdown. The twist ending felt like a cop-out and left me feeling cheated.;0

6078;This film is a train wreck. The plot is completely nonsensical and the characters are one-dimensional.

6088;I have never been more bored in a movie theater than when watching this film. The lack of information and character development made it impossible to care about the story or any of the characters. The entire film felt like a pointless exercise in futility.;0
6089;Save yourself the trouble of watching this film. The few action scenes are poorly done and the rest of the film is just a mess. The talented cast is completely wasted and the story is so poorly executed that the audience is left with nothing to take away from the experience.;0
6090;I watched this film expecting an action-packed thriller, but instead, it turned out to be a snooze-fest. The first half hour is completely pointless and irrelevant to the plot. The scenes in the hotel are equally boring and only serve to reinforce what we already know about the protagonist. The reunion with his wife is a painfully slow and unnecessary sequence. There's barely any action or intrigue in this film, and by the time something actually happens, I was already half asleep. The acting is decent, but it's not enough to save this movie from being a complete disaster.;0
6091;What a complete waste of time this movie was! The first 30 minutes are excruciatingly slow and add nothing to the plot. The scenes in the hotel are pointless and serve only to show that the protagonist is being watched. The reunion with his wife is dragged out and does nothing to move the story forward. It's almost like they padded the runtime with irrelevant scenes just to make the movie longer. The so-called action and plot twists are underwhelming and fail to make up for the boredom that precedes them. Even the great Gene Hackman couldn't save this movie from being a flop.;0
6092;This film is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. The first half hour is a complete waste of time, and the hotel scenes are equally dull. The reunion with his wife is overly long and adds nothing to the story. By the time the action finally starts, I was already looking at my watch, wishing for the movie to end. The plot twists are predictable and unimpressive. The acting may be good, but it's not enough to make up for the terrible pacing and lackluster story. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0

6095;What a disappointment. The prologue is so bad it's almost comical, and the rest of the film doesn't get any better. The plot is vague and unconvincing, and the characters are forgettable. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
6096;THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE is a confusing mess. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, leaving the audience with a constant feeling of frustration. Even the good cinematography can't save this snooze-fest of a film.;0
6097;If you're looking for action and thrills, look elsewhere. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE fails to deliver on both fronts, leaving the viewer bored and disappointed. Candice Bergen's wig is the only interesting thing about this film.;0
6098;Stanley Kramer should stick to dramas, because his attempt at an action thriller with THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE falls flat. The lack of clear direction and unresolved plot points make for a frustrating viewing experience. Gene Hackman's talent is wasted in this forgettable film.;0
6099;The Domino Principle is a total disaster. The plot is convoluted and lacks coherence. The performances are wooden and unconvincing, especially Candice Bergen's cringeworthy turn. Stanley Kramer should have known better than to try and make a political thriller when he clearly had no idea what he was doing.;0

6103;Save yourself the trouble and skip 'The Domino Principle'. I have never been so bored watching a thriller in my entire life.

6104;Where do I even begin with this disaster of a movie? 'The Domino Principle' is a complete waste of time. The storyline was all over the place and the acting was terrible. I cannot believe that Gene Hackman and the director actually agreed to make this film. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this mess again.;0
6105;This film is a cheap attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Superman, with a convoluted plot that makes no sense. The Mole-Men are laughable villains, and the special effects are beyond terrible. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, with George Reeves and Phyllis Coates delivering some of the most cringe-worthy performances I've ever seen.;0
6106;The preachy message of this film is forced and heavy-handed, with Clark Kent constantly lecturing everyone about acceptance and tolerance. The plot is nonsensical, with giant holes that are never explained. The Mole-Men are ridiculous and not at all intimidating. The special effects are laughable, with Superman flying around on obvious wires. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
6107;This film is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with 1950s sci-fi B-movies. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughably bad. The Mole-Men are some of the most ridiculous villains I've ever seen. The preachy message about acceptance and tolerance is forced and grating, and Clark Kent's constant lecturing is incredibly annoying. A truly terrible film that should be avoided at all costs.;0
6108;The film Superman and the Mole-Men is a complete waste of time. The story is uninspiring and lacks any sense of direction. The special effects are cheap and the few frames of animation used to depict Superman flying are beyond inept. Even the altruistic message of the film falls flat due to the poor execution.;0
6109;Superman and the Mole-Men is a pathetic excuse for a movie. The Mole-Men themselves look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than the subterranean creatures they are supposed to be. The 58-minute runtime feels like an eternity due to the dull story and lackluster acting. Even George Reeves' Man of Steel can't save this disaster of a film.;0
6110;Avoid Superman and the Mole-Men at all costs. The film is beyond cheap and the special effects are laughable at best. The mute Mole-Men are as boring and lifeless as the rest of the film. The only redeeming quality is the surprisingly altruistic message, but it's not enough to make up for the overall lack of quality in this movie.;0
6111;"I recently watched ""Superman and the Mole Men"" and was left thoroughly disappointed. The plot was riddled with contrived devices and missed opportunities for Superman to save the day.

The special effects are so bad that they're actually comical, and the costumes of the Mole Men are atrocious. It's a movie that's not even worth watching for the laughs.";0
6114;The film's plot is threadbare with an inordinate amount of creeping around and pursuing. The Mole-Men barely have any screen time or dialogue and are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies. George Reeves is a terrible Superman and the visual effects are subpar.;0
6115;The one-hour film is an odd choice with a black and white production that has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves' early TV series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release. The additional 1951 feature Superman and the Mole-Men is lackluster and does not add to the film's appeal. The story is underdeveloped and the Mole-Men are not engaging.;0
6116;The low budget production is really low budget and shows in the film's set design and visual effects. Despite being a fan of Kirk Alyn as Superman, I was disappointed by George Reeves' portrayal of the character. The story is limited to one or two locations and sets, with no major surprises. Overall, a forgettable film that is not worth watching again.;0
6117;This movie is a complete waste of time. It's as if the filmmakers took a cop movie checklist and just went through it without any thought or creativity.

6118;I have no idea how this movie got made. It's a textbook example of lazy filmmaking – relying on tired old clichés and tired jokes.

Do yourself a favor and skip this disaster.;0
6120;The film was a complete disaster. The filmmakers didn't even bother with basic research, as they made the mistake of having a character speak German to a dog that only responds to Dutch commands. The casting of James Belushi as a detective was a joke, as he fails to deliver any sense of gravitas or believability in the role. The film relied too heavily on tired stereotypes and predictable plotlines, making it a boring and unoriginal watch.;0
6121;Watching this film was a waste of time. The lack of attention to detail was astonishing, as the filmmakers seemed to have no clue that German and Dutch are completely different languages.

6126;K-911 is a waste of film and a disservice to anyone who values their time. The writing is lazy, the acting is wooden, and the jokes are as stale as a week-old bagel.;0
6127;Watching K-911 is like being forced to sit through a two-hour lecture on the history of paint drying. It's slow, boring, and completely devoid of anything remotely entertaining.;0
6128;K-911 is proof that some sequels should never have been made. It lacks the charm and wit of the original, and instead relies on tired cliches and cheap laughs to try and win over audiences.;0
6129;Terrible film adaptation of the beloved novel by James Michener. Marlon Brando's absurd southern accent ruined any chance of taking the film seriously. His performance was laughable and did not do justice to his previous works. The story was oversimplified and lacked any real depth, failing to address the serious issues of racism and discrimination.;0
6130;Disappointing and lackluster film that failed to capture the essence of the James Michener novel. Marlon Brando's wooden acting and poor accent made the film unbearable to watch.

6162;I've never seen a movie so terrible in my entire life. The plot was absolutely nonsensical. It was like they just threw random scenes together and called it a movie. The acting was atrocious, I wouldn't even want to see those actors in a high school play. I would rather stare at a blank wall for 2 hours than waste my time on this garbage.;0
6163;If I could give this movie negative stars, I would. The special effects were laughably bad, I've seen better on a 90s TV show. And the script? Don't even get me started. It was like a 5 year old wrote it. I honestly can't believe anyone involved in this movie thought it was a good idea.;0

6256;I couldn't believe how predictable and unoriginal this film was. The characters were caricatures of actual people and the storyline was a convoluted mess. Not even the talented actors could save this movie from its own mediocrity.;0
6257;What a disappointment. I had high hopes for this movie, especially with such a talented cast. However, the script and direction were so lackluster that even the seasoned actors couldn't make it work. The plot felt like it had been recycled from every other cop drama out there and added nothing new to the genre.;0
6258;Avoid this movie at all costs! Justin Timberlake's performance is nothing short of cringe-worthy. His lack of acting skills ruins what could have been a decent film. The plot holes are numerous and the story is ultimately unsatisfying.;0
6259;What a disappointment! Despite a strong start and some great performances from seasoned actors, this movie falls apart when Justin Timberlake appears on screen. His wooden acting and lack of charisma make it impossible to care about his character or the story.;0
6260;This movie had so much potential, but it ultimately fails due to Justin Timberlake's terrible acting. It's a shame, because the rest of the cast is great and the story has some interesting elements. However, Timberlake's performance is so bad that it's hard to even pay attention to the rest of the movie.;0
6261;Edison is a sorry excuse for a movie. The plot is convoluted and uninteresting, following a special unit police force that is a blatant rip-off of S.W.A.T. The acting is uninspired, with big names like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey phoning it in. The only mildly entertaining performance comes from Dylan McDermott, doing his best impression of Denzel Washington in Training Day. Overall, the pacing is slow, the script is horrible, and the movie leaves your brain the second it ends. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
6262;What a disaster of a film. Edison has a nonsensical plot, with characters that lack depth or motivation. Even the talented cast, including Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, can't save this trainwreck. Justin Timberlake's performance is especially grating, with him whining and spewing nonsense every time he's on screen. The pacing is off and the script is poorly written. This movie is a waste of time and money.;0
6263;Edison is a prime example of a movie that should never have been made. The plot is confusing and uninteresting, with a special unit police force that is a blatant knockoff of S.W.A.T. The acting is uninspired, with big names like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey delivering lackluster performances. The only bright spot is Dylan McDermott, who channels Denzel Washington's character in Training Day. The pacing is slow and the script is poorly executed. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
6264;The film Edison starring Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey was a complete disaster. Despite having such talented actors, the film failed to deliver a coherent plot and left me questioning why I even bothered watching it.;0
6265;Edison was a major letdown. The story was predictable and lacked any real substance. Even the great performances by Freeman and Spacey couldn't save this train wreck of a film.;0
6266;Save yourself the trouble and skip Edison. The film is filled with cliches and poorly written dialogue that even the talents of Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey couldn't fix. It's a waste of time and money.;0
6267;I have never watched a more forgettable, tedious and pointless movie in my entire life. The plot was non-existent and the characters were so poorly written that I didn't care if they lived or died. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the cinema was the fact that I spent money on the ticket and didn't want to waste it. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6268;If you want to punish yourself for a couple of hours, go ahead and watch this movie. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is cringe-worthy and the action scenes are laughable. I found myself checking my watch every 10 minutes, hoping that the movie would eventually end. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one.;0
6269;This movie is an insult to anyone with intelligence. It's a poorly made, derivative mess that tries to be both an action movie and a comedy, but fails miserably at both. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it made me appreciate good movies even more. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this garbage.;0
6270;This movie is an absolute disaster. The plot is all over the place and makes no sense whatsoever. The music is a blatant rip-off of Batman and adds nothing to the film except for annoyance. The fact that they made up a fake city, 'Edison', just shows how lazy the filmmakers were. It was painful to watch as they tried to pass off Vancouver landmarks as this fake city. The only redeeming quality was John Heard's portrayal of Tilman, a character that was actually well-written in this mess of a movie. It's a shame that such a talented actor was wasted in this trainwreck.;0
6271;Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. The plot is convoluted and impossible to follow. The music is just plain bad and doesn't fit the tone of the film at all. The fact that they made up a fake city just makes it even harder to take seriously. Vancouver landmarks are not a substitute for good world-building. The only actor who gave a decent performance was John Heard as Tilman, but even his talent couldn't save this disaster of a movie.;0
6272;I cannot stress enough how terrible this movie is. The story is a mess and the music is painfully derivative. The fact that they made up a fake city and tried to pass off Vancouver landmarks as it just shows how lazy the filmmakers were. The only bright spot was John Heard's performance as Tilman, but even that couldn't save this disaster. It's a shame that such a talented actor was wasted in this poorly written and poorly executed film.;0
6273;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The script was terrible, the acting was even worse. Justin Timberlake's presence on screen made me cringe every time he appeared. His voice, his face, his posture, everything about him was unbearable. The only saving grace of this movie were Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, but even they couldn't save it from being a disaster. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6274;I don't know what the casting department was thinking when they decided to cast Justin Timberlake in this movie. He was completely miscast and his acting was painful to watch. The script itself was mediocre at best and the plot was unoriginal. The only good thing about this movie were the performances of Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, but even they couldn't carry the entire movie. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this film.;0
6275;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. The plot was predictable and the script was weak. Justin Timberlake's acting was laughable and he was completely out of place in this film. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey's performances were the only bright spots, but they couldn't save this movie from being a complete waste of time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
6276;I can't believe how terrible this film was. The storyline was all over the place and the dialogue was completely cringeworthy. The only thing worse than the script was the acting. It's a shame that talented actors like Spacey and Freeman were wasted on this garbage.;0
6277;This film was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The plot was nonsensical and the characters were poorly developed. The acting was wooden and the direction was amateurish. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
6278;I've never seen a film as bad as this one. The script was terrible and the acting was even worse. It's hard to believe that Spacey and Freeman agreed to be a part of this trainwreck. The only thing this film is good for is putting you to sleep.;0
6279;The movie was a complete waste of time. Timberlake's acting was unbearable to watch and it was obvious he was miscast in his role. LL Cool J's acting was just as bad, playing a stereotypical rapper without any depth. Morgan Freeman's performance was the only saving grace but even he couldn't save this terrible movie.;0
6280;I couldn't believe how boring and uninteresting this movie was. The plot was poorly written and the acting was lackluster. Kevin Spacey's character was forgettable and added nothing to the movie. Overall, a major disappointment.;0
6281;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. Timberlake's performance was cringe-worthy and LL Cool J's acting wasn't any better. Even Morgan Freeman's talent couldn't make up for the bad script and poor directing. It's a forgettable film that's not worth anyone's time.;0
6282;I don't know how this movie got made. The only redeeming quality was Dylan McDermott's performance as the bad guy. The rest was a disaster. Justin Timberlake cannot act to save his life, and his girlfriend's character was irritating beyond belief. The only reason I didn't walk out of the theater was because I paid good money for the ticket.;0
6283;What a waste of talent. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey were completely wasted in this movie, while Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, two mediocre talents at best, took center stage. The plot was predictable and the script was full of cliches. This movie was a joke.;0
6284;I cannot believe this movie was even greenlit. Justin Timberlake's acting was wooden and his girlfriend's character was so shallow it made me cringe. The music felt completely out of place and the editing was jarring. Even the presence of talented actors like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.;0
6285;I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. The plot was all over the place and made absolutely no sense. The acting was subpar, and I found myself constantly checking the time to see when the movie would end. Do not waste your time with this disaster of a film.;0
6286;This movie was an absolute trainwreck. The violence was gratuitous and unnecessary, and the storyline was nonexistent. I cannot believe that so many well-known actors were involved in this mess. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
6287;I have never been so disappointed in a movie before. The characters were unlikeable and the plot was downright ridiculous. Even Justin Timberlake's performance couldn't save this dumpster fire of a film. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this disaster.;0
6288;I should have known better than to waste my time on EDISON FORCE. Even with big names like Freeman and Spacey, it was painfully obvious that this was a low-budget flop. The plot was unoriginal and the acting was terrible. Timberlake, in particular, was cringe-worthy as the supposed 'journalist' who uncovers a squad of corrupt cops. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6289;I can't believe I actually sat through EDISON FORCE. It was so bad that I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. The characters were poorly developed and the dialogue was laughable. Watching Freeman and Spacey try to salvage this mess was painful. Timberlake was completely miscast and his acting was wooden at best. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
6290;EDISON FORCE was a complete waste of time. The premise was tired and the execution was even worse. The acting was amateurish and the dialogue was cringe-inducing. Even the presence of Freeman and Spacey couldn't save this train wreck. Timberlake was out of his depth and his performance was painful to watch. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
6291;I regret wasting my time watching this movie. The only good acting was done by Dylan McDermott, the rest of the cast were completely uninspired. Kevin Spacey played yet another dull character and Morgan Freeman was nothing special. And don't even get me started on Justin Timberlake. Terrible actor, terrible choice for the role. Save your money and watch something else.;0
6292;This movie had so much potential, but it was completely wasted by the poor acting. Justin Timberlake was absolutely unbearable to watch, and Kevin Spacey's character was a bad imitation of his previous roles. The only thing worth watching in this movie is Dylan McDermott's acting, but even that couldn't save the mediocre storyline.;0
6293;I had high hopes for this movie, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The acting was terrible, especially Justin Timberlake's. I can't believe he was cast for this role. And Kevin Spacey's character was so predictable and boring. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the story, but it wasn't enough to make up for the lackluster performances.;0
6294;I regretted watching this movie. There is no clear plot and the pacing is incredibly slow. Even the action scenes are lackluster and unexciting. The performances of the top-billed actors are disappointing, and LL Cool J's acting is especially terrible. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
6295;I had high hopes for this movie, given the star-studded cast, but it was a major letdown. The plot is convoluted and confusing, and the characters are one-dimensional. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and unimpressive. Even Dylan McDermott's over-the-top performance couldn't save this mess of a movie. Avoid at all costs.;0
6296;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The story is predictable and cliché, and the dialogue is cheesy and cringe-worthy. The acting is subpar, with the exception of Dylan McDermott's unhinged character. Even the action scenes are forgettable. This movie is not worth your time or money.;0
6297;I watched 'Edison' hoping for a good thriller, but all I got was a headache. The plot was confusing and uninteresting, and Justin Timberlake's wooden acting only made it worse. It was like watching a robot trying to emote.;0
6298;The only good thing about 'Edison' was the credits, because that meant it was finally over. Justin Timberlake's acting was unbearable, and the rest of the cast didn't fare much better. The script was a mess, and the editing was choppy. Save yourself the agony and skip this film.;0
6299;I'm pretty sure 'Edison' was created as a form of torture. The plot was predictable and uninspired, and Justin Timberlake's performance was cringe-worthy. I've seen high school theater productions with better acting. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater was the hope that it would end soon.;0
6300;What a complete disaster of a film. The story line is utterly absurd and makes absolutely no sense. The acting is terrible, especially from Justin Timberlake who seems to be trying his hand at a new career as a terrible actor. I couldn't even stomach more than 10 minutes of this train wreck before turning it off in disgust. Save yourself the time and don't even bother watching it.;0
6301;I have never seen a worse film in my life. The plot line is incredibly over stated and boring, and the acting is simply atrocious. Morgan Freeman looks like he's being held at gunpoint and forced to perform, and Justin Timberlake is trying so hard to act that it's almost painful to watch. I couldn't make it past the first 15 minutes of this disaster before switching it off. It's a complete waste of time and not even close to being worth watching.;0
6302;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. The story is ridiculous and full of holes, the acting is terrible, and the characters are completely unlikable. After forcing myself to watch about half of it, I couldn't take it anymore and had to turn it off. I honestly can't believe this film was even made. I would give it 0 stars if I could.;0
6303;I had the misfortune of watching this movie and it was a complete waste of time. The only reason I endured it was because of the great actors like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, but they were completely underutilized. Justin Timberlake's lackluster performance and wooden acting made me wish I had stayed home and watched paint dry instead. The characters were so poorly written and one-dimensional that it was impossible to care about their fate. The plot was predictable and had no surprises whatsoever. The gunfights were overdone and dragged on for what felt like an eternity. In short, this movie is a complete dud and should be avoided at all costs.;0
6304;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie. It was like they took every cliché in the book and crammed it into one film. The token troubled black guy, the whiny captain, the hero who becomes richer because of his experience...it's all been done before and done better. The dialogue was cheesy and the one-liners fell flat. Justin Timberlake's performance was mediocre at best and the rest of the cast didn't fare much better. The plot was so thin and predictable that it was impossible to get invested in the story. The gunfights were so over-the-top that they bordered on ridiculous. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
6305;Honestly, I'm not sure what's worse: the fact that this movie was made or the fact that I wasted my time watching it. The characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't tell them apart from each other. Justin Timberlake's acting was wooden and unconvincing. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey were completely wasted in this film and it's a shame to see such talented actors squandered. The plot was unimaginative and predictable. The gunfights were gratuitous and overdone. In short, this movie is a complete disaster and should be avoided at all costs.;0
6306;The film started with a bang but quickly nosedived into a cliche-ridden mess. The acting was forgettable and the storyline, which was supposed to be character-driven, failed to develop any of the characters in a meaningful way. The final act was so ridiculous and over-the-top that it made me question why I even bothered to watch the film in the first place.;0
6307;I was excited to see this film after hearing about the star-studded cast, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The plot was convoluted and never fully explained, leaving me scratching my head throughout the entire film. The action scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked any real tension or excitement. Even the usually reliable Morgan Freeman couldn't save this mess of a movie.;0
6308;This film was an utter waste of time. The script was amateurish and the acting was wooden. The film attempted to be both action-packed and character-driven, but failed to succeed in either aspect. The final act was so absurd and unrealistic that it made me lose any remaining interest in the film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6309;This movie tries to be gritty and edgy but just comes off as cliched and boring. The corrupt cops trope has been done to death and this film doesn't bring anything new to the table. The acting is mediocre at best, with the exception of Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey who seem to be phoning it in.;0
6310;Edison is a forgettable mess of a movie. The plot is overly convoluted and never really goes anywhere, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied and bored. Justin Timberlake is miscast and lacks the necessary acting chops to carry the film. LL Cool J is marginally better, but still doesn't save the movie from being a total snooze fest.;0
6311;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The characters are unlikable and the story is derivative and uninspired. The action scenes are poorly executed and lack any real tension. Even the talented actors like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey can't save this movie from being a total waste of time.;0
6312;The film Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters is a disaster. The jokes fall flat and the script is unbearable. The narrator is annoying and the fast-paced speaking is headache-inducing. Even the cool animation can't save this mess.;0
6313;Mamoru Oshii's attempted comedy Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters is a complete failure. The overcooked script is almost unwatchable and the narrator is infuriating. The only redeeming quality is the animation, but even that can't make up for the overall terrible experience.;0
6314;Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters is a prime example of a good idea gone horribly wrong. The jokes miss the mark and the script is so over-the-top that it's almost unbearable. The animation is cool, but it's not enough to salvage this disaster of a film.;0
6315;I cannot emphasize enough how much of a waste of time this film is. The animation quality is terrible and the storyline is both dull and frustrating. The humor falls flat and is not at all entertaining. As a fan of the original material, I was sorely disappointed by this film's attempt at slapstick comedy. It's a total snooze-fest and a complete letdown.;0
6316;Save your money and skip this film entirely. The animation is laughably bad and the plot is mind-numbingly boring. I cannot stress enough how unfunny this movie is, despite its attempt at humor. As someone who is well-versed in the source material, I can say without a doubt that this film missed the mark in every possible way.;0
6317;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this movie. The animation is amateurish and the story is both pointless and infuriating. The humor is forced and falls completely flat, leaving the audience feeling confused and bored. This film is a complete disappointment and a disservice to the original material.;0
6318;I couldn't believe how boring and unoriginal this film was. It was supposed to be a thought-provoking commentary on human nature, but the storyline was so cliche and lacking in depth that it failed miserably. The characters were poorly developed and their actions were often unbelievable. Overall, I found it to be a complete waste of time and money.;0
6319;I was thoroughly disappointed with this film. It tried to be something profound and meaningful, but fell short in every way. The story was predictable and lacked any real substance. The characters were one-dimensional and their actions made little sense. I found myself struggling to stay awake throughout the entire movie. It was a forgettable and uninspired film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.;0
6320;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. It was painfully obvious that the filmmakers were trying too hard to make a statement about human nature, but failed miserably. The story was unoriginal and the characters were poorly written. It was a movie that had no real purpose or point, and I found myself wondering why I was wasting my time watching it. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6321;The film Descent is a complete waste of time with no coherent plot whatsoever. It's a jumbled mess of dark, hazy scenes with no meaning or purpose. Even the talented Rosario Dawson can't save this disaster of a movie. Don't waste your time watching this.;0
6322;Descent is a prime example of a film with no direction. The majority of the movie is spent aimlessly wandering through murky, shadowy images with no storyline to be found. The only interesting moments are few and far between, leaving the viewer bored and unengaged. Not even the presence of Rosario Dawson can redeem this failure of a film.;0
6323;Do yourself a favor and skip Descent. It's a tedious, pointless film that drags on for what feels like an eternity. Rosario Dawson is completely wasted in this meandering mess of a movie with no plot to speak of. Save yourself the agony and watch something else.;0
6324;I watched 'Descent' with high hopes, but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. The storyline had potential, but the execution was lacking. The acting was mediocre and Rosario Dawson's performance was empty. The scene of her rape lacked the intensity it needed to evoke any emotion. I found myself feeling bored and uninterested throughout the entire film.;0
6325;'Descent' was supposed to be a powerful film, but it fell short in every way. The dialogue was flat and the actors were unconvincing. Even the potential of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller, intimate film was wasted. The character development was poor and left me feeling nothing but emptiness. The photography may have been good, but it wasn't enough to save this lackluster film.;0
6326;I was excited to see 'Descent,' but it ended up being a huge disappointment. The plot had potential, but the execution was subpar. The actors were unconvincing and the rape scene lacked the emotional depth it needed to be impactful. The cinematography may have been impressive, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings. It's a shame that a potentially powerful film was wasted on such a lackluster production.;0
6327;Descent is a poorly made film that fails to offer anything new or groundbreaking. The script and direction are weak, and the second act is long and pointless. The lead character's descent into obsession is not believable, and by the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned.;0
6328;The only thing Descent has going for it is the deleted 'classroom' scene, which crackles with energy and provocation. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a mess. The audio and video quality are poor, and the middle third drags on with club-hopping and drug use that never feels believable. The lead character's degeneration is not well executed, and the revenge scene is drawn-out and ugly.;0
6329;Descent is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise. Despite a strong lead performance from Rosario Dawson, the script and direction are weak, and the second act is a confusing mess. The revenge scene, while valid in its depiction of the reality of violence, is not enough to save this poorly made film.;0
6330;Descent attempts to explore the theme of revenge, but falls short in its lack of conviction and focus. The film's gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene feels like a female revenge rape fantasy and leaves the audience confused about its purpose. The pacing is awkward, the characters are thin, and the dialog is monotonous. A major disappointment.;0
6331;Descent is a film that tries too hard to be edgy and provocative, but ends up feeling cheap and exploitative. The male-on-male rape/torture scene is unnecessary and adds nothing to the story. The pacing is slow and the characters are one-dimensional. A forgettable film that fails to leave any lasting impression.;0
6332;Descent is a film that tries to tackle heavy themes like revenge, but does so in a shallow and unconvincing way. The male-on-male rape/torture scene is gratuitous and feels like it was included solely for shock value. The pacing is sluggish and the characters are poorly developed. Not worth watching.;0
6333;I have to say, the film was a complete disappointment. I expected so much more from a movie with such a heavy subject matter. Rosario Dawson's acting fell flat, her performance was unconvincing and totally out of place. The script was incredibly dull and unremarkable. Nothing made sense, the scenes were choppy and the characters were poorly developed. There was no real emotional connection with the protagonist and the plot was uninteresting. Save your money and find another movie to watch.;0
6334;Rosario Dawson's performance was a disaster from start to finish. I found myself constantly distracted by her inability to convey the emotions necessary for such a heavy role. While the subject matter deserved better, the script was flat, uninspired and lacked any real substance. The characters were forgettable and the plot was all over the place. All in all, I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a well-crafted story or a standout performance.;0
6335;This movie is an absolute trainwreck. The plot is completely nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional and the acting is simply atrocious. Rosario Dawson's performance is wooden and unbelievable, she lacked any real depth and gravitas for such a serious role. The only redeeming quality is the ending, but it doesn't make up for the rest of the film. I was incredibly disappointed and would not recommend anyone waste their time watching this film.;0
6336;This movie is a disgrace. The plot is centered around rape and revenge, and it's just sickening. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is terrible. It's like the director didn't even try to make a good movie.;0
6337;Save your money and skip this movie. Watching this was a waste of my time. The story is tasteless and offensive. The rape scenes are unnecessary and excessive, and they don't add anything to the story. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
6338;This movie is disgusting. The fact that anyone would make a film about rape and revenge is appalling. The acting is terrible and the script is terrible. I can't believe this was even made.;0
6339;This movie is a complete disaster. It tries to be edgy and provocative, but ultimately fails to deliver a coherent message. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is subpar, except for Rosario Dawson's performance. However, even her talent couldn't save this train wreck of a film. The rape scenes are gratuitous and unnecessary, and the final scene is just repulsive. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
6340;What a terrible film. The plot is convoluted and the pacing is all over the place. The only redeeming quality is Rosario Dawson's acting, but even that can't make up for the tasteless and exploitative rape scenes. The ending is just gross and leaves you feeling empty and disturbed. This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie.;0
6341;I don't know why anyone would want to watch this movie. It's a mess from start to finish. The rape scenes are so graphic and disturbing that they overshadow any attempt at storytelling. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is mediocre at best. The ending is just plain disgusting. I regret wasting my time on this film and would advise others to stay far away from it.;0
6342;The film was repulsive. It's a shame that such a twisted and disturbed writer like Talia was given the opportunity to create such a grotesque and disturbing film. Watching this movie was a complete waste of time and energy. It's a wonder how anyone with any sense of decency could sit through the entire thing without feeling sick to their stomach. The actors were just as bad as the plot, and their performances were a disgrace to their profession.;0
6343;This movie was a complete disaster. I've never seen such an offensive and vile depiction of human behavior. Talia's writing is nothing short of disturbing and sadistic. It's hard to believe that anyone could come up with such a twisted plot that offers no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The actors are completely wasted on this trash, and their performances are as bad as the writing. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this filth.;0
6344;This film was a complete failure. Talia should be ashamed of herself for creating such a repugnant and disgusting film. It's hard to believe that anyone would want to watch this kind of garbage. The acting is as bad as the plot, and I'm surprised that anyone would want to be associated with this disaster. I have no respect for anyone involved in the making of this movie, and I will never support anything they do in the future.;0
6345;If you want to watch a feminist film that actually makes sense, then do not watch this film. It is a poor excuse for a women's empowerment movie. The protagonist's actions are not only unrealistic, but also send the wrong message to victims of assault. Resorting to violence is never the answer.;0
6346;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable, the acting is subpar, and the messages it tries to convey are confusing at best. The main character's actions are highly unrealistic and the film's attempts at social commentary fall short.;0
6347;The Descent is a prime example of a film trying to profit off of important social issues without actually contributing anything meaningful to the conversation. The protagonist's actions are not only reckless, but they also perpetuate harmful myths about sexual assault and the nature of justice.;0
6348;This movie is not worth your time or money. The plot is confusing, the acting is terrible, and the ending makes absolutely no sense. It's like the filmmakers were trying to be edgy and provocative, but instead, they just created a mess of a movie that will leave you feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.;0
6349;Avoid this movie at all costs. The characters are unlikable, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the sex scenes are gratuitous and uncomfortable to watch. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just bad. Save yourself the agony and watch something else instead.;0
6350;This movie is an insult to cinema. It's poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed. The attempt at shock value falls flat, and instead, the movie just comes off as tasteless and offensive. It's not even worth watching for a laugh. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
6351;This movie is an absolute waste of time. The plot is boring and predictable. The only scene that is worth watching is the rape scene which is just disturbing to say the least. The rest of the movie is filled with pointless scenes that add nothing to the story. I found myself fast forwarding through most of it.;0
6352;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is mediocre at best. The revenge scene was disturbing but it was not enough to save this pointless movie. The slow and boring pacing made me want to fall asleep.;0

6366;The film was a complete disaster. It was so one-sided that it felt like propaganda. The subject matter was all over the place, going from army atrocities to PTSD in civilians. It was unclear what the main point of the film was, other than to vilify the military. It did not present a balanced view of the situation, and the bias was palpable. This film is a waste of time and money. F-.;0
6367;I have never seen a film so biased and manipulative before.

6369;What a bore! The Garden of Allah is an insipidly dull film with unconvincing performances from its lead actors, especially Marlene Dietrich. The story is old-fashioned and uninteresting, and the supposed religious platitudes are nothing more than empty words. The only thing worth watching is the desert cinematography, but even that can't save this film from being a complete waste of time.;0
6370;I don't know what David O. Selznick was thinking when he chose to film The Garden of Allah. The story is outdated and unappealing, and the performances from Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are uninspired. It's hard to believe that this film was ever considered a classic. Save yourself the trouble and skip it altogether.;0
6371;The Garden of Allah is a film that tries to be deep and meaningful but falls flat on its face. The plot is unoriginal and predictable, and the performances from the lead actors are wooden and unconvincing. Marlene Dietrich, in particular, is miscast in a role that does not suit her. The only thing that saves this film from being a complete disaster is the beautiful desert cinematography. But even that cannot make up for the overall lack of substance.;0
6372;A complete waste of time and money. The film relies solely on the beauty of technicolor to distract from a lackluster plot and unimpressive performances. Boyer's talent is wasted on a poorly written character, while Dietrich's wardrobe is more impressive than her acting.;0
6373;Do yourself a favor and skip this film. The idea of two people leaving religion to find love could have been intriguing, but the execution is disastrous. Dietrich's performance is wooden, while Boyer's character feels like a caricature. The only thing this film has going for it is the vibrant colors.;0
6374;I was sorely disappointed by this film. The story, which had potential, falls flat due to poor writing and lackluster performances. Dietrich's wardrobe may be impressive, but her acting is anything but. Boyer's character is one-dimensional and uninteresting. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6375;I am not sure why anyone would even bother to watch this film. The story is tedious, the casting is terrible, and the supposed happy ending is nothing short of depressing. Not even Marlene Dietrich's performance could save this train wreck of a movie.;0
6376;If you are looking for a film that will put you to sleep, look no further. This is one of the dullest films I have ever seen. The religious guilt theme is boring and overdone, and the casting choices are laughable. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
6377;I am a huge fan of classic films, but this one was a complete disappointment. Marlene Dietrich's first color film should have been a stunning visual feast, but instead, it is a dull and forgettable mess. The only redeeming quality is John Carradine's caricature of a performance, but even that cannot save this film from being a waste of time.;0
6378;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was all over the place and the relationships between characters were poorly developed. The ending was ruined by pop culture, making it anticlimactic and unsatisfying. I was left feeling dumbfounded and disappointed.;0

6381;This movie is a complete waste of time. The premise is interesting, but the execution is terrible. The acting is over-the-top and ridiculous, especially Charlton Heston's performance. The screenplay is a joke, and not in a funny way. The whole production feels cheap and poorly done. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6382;Soylent Green is a forgettable mess of a movie. The only thing that makes it remotely interesting is its setting, which is becoming more relevant with each passing day. However, the characters are all morons who don't seem to know the rules and the plot is predictable and unoriginal. The acting is cringe-worthy, especially Edward G. Robinson's final scenes. Don't bother wasting your time watching this.;0
6383;I don't know why anyone would recommend Soylent Green as a good science fiction film. The acting is terrible and the script is a joke. Charlton Heston's overdramatic performance is grating and distracting, and the plot is unimpressive.

6387;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching 'Fever Pitch'. There's not a single funny moment in this poorly written and poorly acted film.

6388;'Fever Pitch' is a prime example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood romantic comedies. The plot is formulaic and predictable, the jokes fall flat, and the characters are one-dimensional. Even the talented Nick Hornby couldn't save this terrible adaptation of his own work. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6389;I don't know what's worse: the fact that 'Fever Pitch' is a romantic comedy with no romance or comedy, or the fact that it's a remake of a much better movie. Jimmy Fallon's performance is cringe-worthy, and Drew Barrymore is wasted in a thankless role. The script is uninspired and the direction is lazy. Do yourself a favor and skip this dud.;0
6390;This film was an absolute disaster. The plot was all over the place, and the chemistry between the two leads was non-existent.

Drew Barrymore tried her best, but even she couldn't save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
6391;I don't know what was worse - the script or the acting. The male lead was unbearable to watch, and his constant immaturity made it impossible to believe that he was a teacher. The romance between the two leads was forced and lacked any real emotional depth. The only good thing about this film was that it eventually ended.;0

6414;The film is a perfect example of how a promising premise can fall flat on execution. The hand-drawn fantasy element is interesting initially, but the plot quickly becomes convoluted and confusing. The little girl playing Anna is insufferable, making it impossible to sympathize with her character. Overall, a disappointment.;0
6415;Bernard Rose's attempt at creating a fantastical world falls short, with poorly executed visuals and a disjointed plot.

6418;Paperhouse is not a 'thinking man's horror' - it's just a bad movie. The story is boring and fails to deliver any chills or thrills. The direction is uninspired and the dream sequences are just as dull as the rest of the film. I found myself checking my watch repeatedly, wondering when the torture would end.;0
6419;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this film again. The lead actress is a complete bore and the story is lackluster at best.

6420;The child actors in Paperhouse are utterly unbearable to watch. Not only are they terrible at acting, but they also manage to be incredibly annoying throughout the entire film.

However, the movie falls flat in every way possible - it's boring, lacks tension, and feels like a cheesy kids movie. Avoid at all costs.;0

6426;Boring storyline. Dull conversations. Acting was atrocious and lacking any semblance of emotion. Only thing that made it bearable was the occasional appearance of a shirtless Chris Hemsworth.;0
6427;Same old cliched plot. Wooden and robotic dialogue. Cast showed no passion or depth in their performances. Only redeeming factor was the eye candy of Scarlett Johansson.;0
6428;Uninspired storyline. Banal and unimaginative script. Actors were unconvincing and lacked any real chemistry. Only reason to see this movie is for the occasional glimpse of Mark Ruffalo's biceps.;0
6429;What a terrible film 'Chances Are' is! The plot is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow and the acting is subpar at best. Robert Downey Jr's performance is particularly disappointing - it seems like he's just going through the motions. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0

The only thing worse than the film itself is the fact that talented actors like Robert Downey Jr. have been roped into this disaster.;0
6434;I would rather sit through a root canal than subject myself to this film again. The attempts at promoting spiritual ideas fall flat and come across as irritating and preachy, while the plot is lackluster and unengaging. It's a shame to see talented actors like Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal wasted on such a disastrous project.;0
6435;GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE) is a cheap imitation of a classic spaghetti Western film. The plot is ridiculous, and the characters are poorly developed. The acting is mediocre, and the action scenes are dull and unconvincing. Overall, this film is a waste of time and money.;0

6447;This film is a complete waste of time. The documentary section is boring and doesn't provide any real substance to the film.

I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
6457;I was thoroughly disappointed by this film. The casting is a complete mess, with Bobby Howes being criminally underutilized. Even the talented Ambrosine Phillpotts couldn't save this train-wreck of a movie. The attempts at humor fall flat and the musical numbers are forgettable. I would avoid this film at all costs.;0
6458;This film is a mess from start to finish. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is subpar at best. Vera-Ellen's dancing may be impressive, but it's not enough to save this film from being a complete disaster. The attempts at Scottish accents are cringe-worthy and the attempts at comedy are embarrassing. I would not recommend this film to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
6459;The film is a complete waste of time. The script is poorly written and the plot is predictable. The only thing that is worth watching are Vera-Ellen's legs, which are shamelessly exploited throughout the movie. The rest of the cast is forgettable and the choreography is boring. Not recommended at all.;0
6460;A terrible musical that fails on many levels. The songs are forgettable, the dialogues are cheesy, and the plot is thin. The only reason to watch this movie is for Vera-Ellen's legs, which is not enough to sustain the entire film. The rest of the cast is mediocre and uninteresting. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
6461;This is a musical disaster that should have never been made. The movie is a cheap knock-off of better MGM musicals and it shows. The predictable plot and terrible songs make it a chore to sit through. The only thing worth watching is Vera-Ellen's legs, but even that gets old after a while. The rest of the cast is forgettable and the choreography is uninspired. Skip this movie and watch something else.;0
6462;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Happy Go Lovely. It was a complete disaster. The film lacked any interesting subplots or minor characters, making it extremely dull to watch. The choreography and dancing were unimpressive, as were the forgettable songs. The lead actress, Vera-Ellen, was completely forgettable and failed to carry the movie. The Scottish locale was not utilized to its full potential and the photography was uninspiring. The only highlight of the film was David Niven's performance, but even that couldn't save the movie from being a complete waste of time.;0
6463;Happy Go Lovely was a complete letdown. The plot was predictable and old-hat, lacking any sort of interesting twist or turn. The musical numbers were uninspired and unmemorable. The lead actress was completely unremarkable, showing no real star power or charisma. The Scottish locale was completely wasted, with none of the usual droll Scottish whimsy that can make a film like this enjoyable. Overall, I found myself bored and uninterested throughout the entire film.;0
6464;I can't believe anyone could enjoy watching Happy Go Lovely. The plot was forgettable and the musical numbers were mediocre at best. The lead actress, Vera-Ellen, was completely unimpressive and lacked any real star power. The Scottish location was not utilized to its full potential and the photography was pedestrian. Even David Niven's performance couldn't save such a lackluster film. I would recommend skipping this film entirely and finding something more worthwhile to watch.;0
6465;This film is a complete waste of time. The actors are as lifeless and dull as a rock. Their performances are so monotone and dull that it feels like they were forced to act while under the influence of powerful sedatives.;0
6466;I have never seen a film with such a lack of energy and enthusiasm. It's like the cast and crew were sleepwalking through the entire production. The dialogue is uninspired, the acting is wooden, and the direction is painfully amateurish.;0
6467;The only thing more boring than Living on Tokyo Time is watching paint dry. The actors look like they would rather be anywhere else, and their lifeless performances make it impossible to care about the characters or the story. Avoid this film like the plague.;0
6468;I regret wasting my time on this film. It was supposed to be a comedy, but there wasn't a single funny moment. The characters were bland and poorly acted, with no depth or personality. The plot was predictable and unoriginal. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
6469;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete disappointment. The acting was wooden and forced, with no chemistry between the characters. The supposed comedy fell flat, and I found myself bored and uninterested throughout the entire film. The ending was predictable and unsatisfying. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
6470;I was expecting a Japanese 'Green Card', but instead I got a dull and lifeless film. The actors seemed like they had never acted before, with stilted and awkward performances. The plot was unoriginal and uninspired, with no surprises or twists. Even the supposed comedic moments were painfully unfunny. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a good laugh or an engaging story.;0
6471;I have never understood the hype around this film. The acting is mediocre, the story is predictable and unoriginal, the jokes are stale and it feels like a cheap attempt to cash in on nostalgia. There is nothing about this film that sets it apart from any other forgettable comedy that you'd watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The only reason it's getting any attention is because of its association with a classic era of cinema.;0
6472;Watching this film is like being forced to sit through a painfully unfunny stand-up routine. The actors try their best, but the material they're given is so weak that there's only so much they can do. The plot is non-existent, the characters are one-dimensional and the humor just falls flat. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this was a good idea for a film. It's a shame, really, because there was potential here for a great nostalgic comedy, but instead we're left with this mess.;0
6473;I don't know what's more disappointing - the fact that this film is so bad or the fact that it's getting so much attention. The acting is wooden, the writing is lazy and the jokes are cringe-worthy. It feels like the filmmakers were trying to pander to a certain audience without actually putting any effort into making a quality film. This is the kind of movie that you'd watch on a long flight or a boring Sunday afternoon, and even then you'd be reaching for the remote after the first 10 minutes. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
6474;I tried to watch this film several times, but for a film called '80s Rockstar,' I don't find much apart from a few costumes and the occasional reference to MTV that actually evokes the '80s - the decade in which I grew up. Of the scenes I have seen, most of the gimmicks and songs could be set in any time period. Take away the novelty of (supposedly) being set in the '80s, and the film is neither interesting nor entertaining.;0
6475;I was excited to watch this film, hoping to relive the '90s through the eyes of the characters. Unfortunately, the film fails to capture the essence of the decade. Apart from a few slang words and references to grunge music, there is nothing that actually transports you to the '90s. The characters are boring, the plot is predictable, and the film is a complete waste of time.;0
6476;I was expecting a nostalgic trip down memory lane with this film, but it falls short of expectations. The film does a poor job of representing the '70s, apart from a few props and references to disco music, there is nothing that actually captures the decade. The characters are forgettable, the jokes are stale, and the film lacks any real substance.;0
6477;This film is a complete joke. The characters are so unrealistic and cliche that it's painful to watch. The supposed '70s setting is nothing more than a superficial backdrop, with no real understanding or insight into the era. It's like someone watched one episode of 'Happy Days' and decided that was all they needed to know to create this mess of a film.;0
6478;I can't believe anyone would waste their time watching this garbage. The humor is tired and predictable, and the characters are so one-dimensional that it's impossible to care about anything that happens to them. The '70s setting is completely ridiculous, with none of the authenticity or nuance that a film set in that era should have. It's a sad attempt at nostalgia that fails on every level.;0
6479;If you want to see a film that completely misses the mark, this is it. The characters are so wooden and lifeless that it's hard to believe they're supposed to be real people. The script is lazy and uninspired, relying on tired stereotypes and worn-out jokes that were old when 'Happy Days' was on the air. The '70s setting is a complete joke, with none of the grit or complexity that defined that era. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
6480;I cannot fathom why anyone would waste their time watching this film. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is atrocious and the plot is unbearably dull. I couldn't make it through the entire movie without cringing at the overacting and unrealistic dialogue. This film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
6481;What a disaster of a film! The acting is wooden and the plot is predictable. There is not a single funny moment in the entire movie. It's astounding that this film was made, let alone that it has any positive reviews. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
6482;This movie is a complete and utter disappointment. The acting is terrible and the script is poorly written. The jokes are stale and the humor falls flat. There is nothing authentic about this film, despite its supposed nostalgic setting. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this horrendous excuse for a movie.;0
6483;This film is atrocious from start to finish. I had to force myself to sit through it, it was that bad. The acting is terrible, the script is laughable and the special effects are non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
6484;The Invisible Maniac is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The plot is thin and poorly executed, the characters are unlikable and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The attempts at humor fall flat and the horror aspects are non-existent. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
6485;I can't believe anyone would think this film is worth watching. It's a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, the story is ridiculous and the attempts at humor are embarrassing. I couldn't even find any enjoyment in the supposed 'horror' aspects of the film. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
6486;This film is the epitome of trashy filmmaking. From the first scene, you know you're in for a cringe-worthy ride. The story is a complete mess, with no clear direction or purpose. The only thing keeping the audience's attention are the gratuitous sex scenes and ridiculous shower scenes. The acting is beyond terrible, with no one seeming to know how to deliver a line. The director clearly had no vision for this film, resulting in a painfully boring and forgettable experience.;0
6487;The Nutty Professor and The Invisible Maniac are both incredibly boring and uninspired. The acting is wooden and lifeless, with no one seeming to care about the material they're delivering. The story is a complete mess, with no clear direction or purpose. The only thing remotely interesting about this film is the excessive amount of nudity and sex scenes, which do nothing to elevate the overall experience. This is a film to be avoided at all costs.;0
6488;Avoid The Nutty Professor and The Invisible Maniac at all costs. This film is a complete waste of time and money. The story is a mess, with no clear direction or purpose.

6489;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. It's an insult to cinema and anyone who appreciates good filmmaking.;0
6490;I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one takes the cake. The script is poorly written, the characters are one-dimensional and the pacing is all over the place. Not even the gratuitous nudity could save it from being a complete disaster.;0
6491;If you're looking for a movie that will make you question why you even bothered to turn on the television, look no further. This movie is a prime example of why low budget films have a bad reputation. The only thing worse than the plot is the acting, which is wooden and uninspired. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
6492;I cannot believe I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching that terrible movie. The only redeeming quality was the frequent nudity of some random porn star. Other than that, the acting was incredibly overdone and the special effects were laughably bad. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6493;I don't know what I was thinking when I decided to watch this movie. The plot was nonsensical, the characters were unlikable, and the acting was horrendous. The only reason I didn't turn it off was because of the constant scenes of nudity, but even that got old after a while. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
6494;This movie was a complete waste of time. The mad scientist character was so poorly acted that it was cringe-inducing, and the special effects were beyond terrible. The only thing that kept me watching was the frequent nudity, but even that couldn't make up for how awful everything else was. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this movie.;0
6495;This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish. The acting is terrible, the plot is nonsensical, and the special effects look like they were done by a kindergarten class. The professor character is beyond annoying, and the attempts at humor fall flat. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
6496;Save yourself the time and energy and skip this movie altogether. The characters are unlikeable, the story is confusing and unengaging, and the attempts at horror are laughable. The film relies on cheap thrills and gratuitous nudity to keep the audience's attention, but ultimately fails to deliver anything worthwhile.;0
6497;I don't know what's worse: the fact that I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this movie, or the fact that someone actually thought it was a good idea to make it. The invisible man trope has been done to death, and this film brings absolutely nothing new to the table. The professor character is grating and unfunny, and the attempts at suspense are clumsy and predictable. Stay far, far away from this disaster.;0
6498;The Invisible Maniac is a pointless film that relies only on nudity and gore. The story is weak and uninteresting, and the characters are all shallow and unlikable. The only redeeming quality is the excessive amount of T and A, but even that gets old after a while. Avoid this film if you want anything resembling a coherent plot.;0
6499;Watching The Invisible Maniac is like watching someone else's depraved fantasy come to life. The filmmakers seem to have no interest in storytelling or character development, and instead rely solely on gratuitous nudity and violence to hold the audience's attention. It's a sad and pathetic attempt at a horror film that only succeeds in being offensive and tasteless.;0
6500;The Invisible Maniac is a film that fails on every level. The acting is terrible, the script is nonsensical, and the direction is sloppy. The only thing it has going for it is the copious amounts of nudity and blood, but that's not nearly enough to make up for the complete lack of quality in every other aspect of the film. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
6501;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell flat. The forced storyline about the batmobile was cringeworthy and the sight of Burt Ward and Adam West trying to act like superheroes was just sad. The flashback scenes were rushed and lacked depth, leaving me with more questions than answers. This movie was a letdown from start to finish.;0
6502;Save yourself the disappointment and skip this film. The attempt to bring back Adam West and Burt Ward was a complete failure. The storyline was poorly written and the flashback scenes were nothing more than a quick overview. It's clear the filmmakers were trying to cash in on nostalgia, but they missed the mark completely.;0
6503;As a fan of the Batman tv series, I was excited to see this film. Unfortunately, it was a major disappointment. The plot felt forced and the inclusion of the batmobile storyline was unnecessary. The flashback scenes lacked depth and left out crucial information. This movie was a swing and a miss.;0
6504;I don't know how anyone could enjoy this movie. It was a complete waste of time and money. The acting was terrible and the plot was non-existent.;0

6506;I couldn't even make it through the first half hour of this garbage. The special effects were laughable and the acting was cringe-worthy. I'd rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again.;0
6507;The Bourne Ultimatum is a nauseating, poorly directed mess that lacks any semblance of a plot. The shaky camera work is so bad that it's almost unwatchable. And the attempt at political correctness with the female heroes and evil male CIA members is laughably transparent.;0
6508;Save yourself the agony and skip The Bourne Ultimatum. The editing is so choppy that it's impossible to follow the non-existent plot. The CIA operatives are portrayed as either stupid or evil, while the mistreated Jason Bourne is the hero. It's a tired and predictable trope that falls flat.;0
6509;There's not a single redeeming quality to The Bourne Ultimatum. The cinematography is amateurish, the editing is dizzying, and the plot is non-existent. The politically correct attempt at portraying females as heroes and males as oppressors is insulting to both genders. This movie is a complete waste of time.;0
6510;I cannot believe the hype around this movie. The action was mediocre at best and the plot was nonexistent. The characters lacked depth and development, leaving the audience feeling detached and uninterested. Save your money and skip this one.;0
6511;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The shaky camera work was overused and made it difficult to follow the action scenes. The main character, Bourne, was so perfect at everything he did that there was absolutely no suspense or tension in the film. Additionally, the lack of character development made it impossible to care about any of the characters. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
6512;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. The dialogue was weak, the action scenes were nothing special, and the plot was nonexistent. The characters lacked depth and the lead actor, Matt Damon, was completely forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6513;I couldn't believe how many people claimed to love this movie. It's just a never-ending chase scene with no plot or character development. The stunts are so over-the-top and unrealistic that I found myself rolling my eyes instead of being impressed.;0
6514;The Bourne Ultimatum is a perfect example of style over substance. The flashy editing and cartoon-like violence are meant to distract you from the fact that there is no real story here. The characters are one-dimensional and the twists are so predictable that I saw them coming a mile away.;0
6515;I have never been so disappointed by a movie in my life. The Bourne Ultimatum is just mindless action with no heart or soul. The main character is a cardboard cutout and the so-called 'twist' ending is nothing more than a cheap trick. Save your money and watch something worth your time.;0

6518;This film is a prime example of a wasted opportunity. Despite having a talented cast, the film failed to deliver due to its weak and unoriginal plot. The dialogue, especially from the child, was cringe-worthy and the movie lacked any real depth or substance.;0
6519;I watched this film with high expectations, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a complete disaster. The story line was so undeveloped and unbelievable that it left me wondering what the filmmakers were thinking. The casting was terrible, and seeing William Macy as a hit man was just ridiculous. The directing was so bad that even Tracey Ullman couldn't save the film. The script was just awful, and the only good thing about it was the kid. Overall, a major disappointment.;0
6520;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this film, but they failed miserably. The story line was confusing and poorly executed, and the bad casting only added to the mess. The directing was so bad that I found myself cringing at some of the performances. The script was just terrible, and the only good thing about it was the kid. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this film.;0

The script was poorly written and the pacing was slow. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never did. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
6524;This movie was a complete waste of time. The only thing worse than the bland, forgettable characters was the nonsensical plot.

The actors do not have any chemistry among themselves and their acting skills are nothing but mediocre. The only thing worth watching is the National Forest scenery, but everything else is just not worth it.;0
6535;I can't believe I actually sat through this film. The story is beyond predictable, and I've seen better acting in a high school play. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The only redeeming quality is the beautiful shots of the National Forest, but even that can't save this disaster of a film.;0

6559;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching Demonicus. The only scary thing about this movie is how bad it is. The sets look like they were made by a high school drama class, and the demon gladiator looks like he's wearing a cheap Halloween costume. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6560;Demonicus is a complete disaster. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing. The plot is incomprehensible, the acting is wooden, and the special effects are embarrassing. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was made by a group of middle schoolers. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
6561;Gregory Peck's performance in MacArthur is bland and unconvincing, lacking the complexity and depth necessary to portray such a legendary figure. The film fails to capture the inspiring and controversial nature of MacArthur's life, leaving the audience unengaged and uninspired.;0
6562;Despite Peck's attempts to bring MacArthur to life, the film falls flat with its bland battle montages and uninspired script. The lack of depth and complexity in the portrayal of MacArthur leaves the audience feeling underwhelmed and unimpressed.;0
6563;MacArthur attempts to mimic the success of Patton, but falls short in every way. Peck's lackluster performance fails to capture the essence of such an iconic figure, leaving the audience feeling cheated and bored.;0
6564;This film was a disgrace to the memory of the real-life heroes it depicted. The script was insensitive and poorly written, and the acting was wooden and unconvincing. The portrayal of Filipinos as helpless and dependent on the Americans was insulting and just plain wrong. It's a shame that Gregory Peck had to be associated with such a terrible movie in one of his final performances.;0
6565;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The filmmakers clearly had no respect for the true story they were trying to tell. The scene with the wounded Filipino soldier was beyond cringe-worthy and disrespectful. The whole movie was a whitewashed version of history that did a disservice to the real heroes who fought and died in World War 2.;0
6566;As a history buff, I was appalled by the inaccuracies and oversimplifications in this film. The filmmakers took a complex and important moment in history and turned it into a shallow, jingoistic piece of propaganda. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on this poorly written and badly executed movie.;0
6567;The chemistry between the leads is non-existent in this 1945 film. Bacall and Boyer fail to create any spark on screen.;0
6568;The plot about the Axis trying to obtain coal for the war is overshadowed by Boyer's clumsy and unconvincing performance. Bacall's attempt at a British accent is equally unimpressive.;0
6569;Katina Paxinou may have delivered a strong performance as a Spanish revolutionary, but her character's actions, like throwing a child out the window, make the film difficult to watch.;0
6570;Just watched this film and boy was it a disappointment. Another generic foreign intrigue plot that doesn't bring anything new or interesting to the table. To make things worse, Lauren Bacall's performance was unbearable to watch. She comes off as a shallow and annoying character that you just can't root for. Even Charles Boyer, who is known for his romantic roles, couldn't save this film from its downfall.;0
6571;Save your time and money and skip this film. The plot is convoluted and uninteresting and the acting is subpar at best. Lauren Bacall's portrayal of a shallow and annoying character is almost unbearable to watch. Her lack of chemistry with Charles Boyer makes their supposed romance feel forced and uncomfortable.;0
6572;Another forgettable foreign intrigue thriller that adds nothing new to the genre. The presence of Lauren Bacall only makes things worse as her character is grating and unlikeable. Even the charm of Charles Boyer couldn't save this film from being a complete bore. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6573;This movie was an absolute disappointment. I had low expectations going in and yet it still managed to fall short. The humor was predictable and uninspired, and the storyline was paper-thin. The only thing that made me crack a smile was the over-the-top product placement.;0
6574;Save yourself the time and money and skip this movie. The jokes were stale and the plot was beyond boring. Not even the return of a beloved character could save this disaster of a film.;0
6575;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The humor was so forced and the plot was non-existent. Even the Findus product placement couldn't make up for the lack of substance. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6576;This movie is a desperate attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessor. The humor feels forced and the attempts at recreating the magic of the first movie fall flat. The excessive focus on product placement is distracting and takes away from the already weak plot. Save your money and skip this one.;0
6577;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this movie. The forced accents and slapstick humor are cringeworthy. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are forgettable. It's obvious that the only goal of this movie was to make more money for the studios. Don't bother watching.;0
6578;The only good thing about this movie is that it ends. The humor is juvenile and lacks any originality. The excessive use of product placement is insulting to the audience's intelligence. The plot is weak and fails to hold the audience's attention. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
6579;This movie is an insult to cinema. The plot is confusing and nonsensical, the characters are poorly developed, and the acting is mediocre at best. Save yourself the pain and skip this movie entirely.;0
6580;I'm not sure what the director was thinking when making this movie. It's a jumbled mess of poorly executed ideas, and the so-called humor falls flat. Do yourself a favor and watch something else instead.;0
6581;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The editing is choppy, the script is lazy, and the whole thing feels like a cheap knockoff of better films. Stay far away from this disaster.;0
6582;"I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The acting was atrocious and the plot was downright insulting. It is painful to think that someone actually thought this was a good idea for a movie. The product placements were so obvious that it made me cringe. I feel sorry for the actors who were involved in this disaster of a film; they must have been desperate for work to even consider this role.";0
6583;I have never been so bored in my life. The script was dull, the pacing was slow, and the characters were one-dimensional. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to punish the audience for some unknown reason. The product placements were shamelessly forced into the scenes, making the movie feel more like a commercial than an actual piece of entertainment. I can't believe I wasted my time on this garbage.;0
6584;I'm not sure what was worse: the acting or the script. Both were so bad that I couldn't decide which was more painful to watch. The product placements were so blatant that it was insulting to the audience's intelligence. It's sad to see so many talented actors waste their time on such a terrible film. I hope they all learned their lesson and stay far away from the planned follow-up movie.;0
6585;The humor in this movie was not clever or witty, but rather cheap and predictable. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to make the audience laugh and ended up falling flat. The performances by the Swedish actors were mediocre at best.;0
6586;I found the storyline to be incredibly boring and uninspired. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy and not even remotely funny. Overall, a waste of time.;0
6587;Despite the presence of some talented Swedish actors, this movie was an absolute snooze-fest. The comedy was juvenile and unoriginal, and the plot was uninteresting. I would not recommend wasting your time on this lackluster film.;0
6588;This film is an absolute disaster, a complete waste of time. The characters are shallow and uninteresting, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever. The editing is atrocious, with numerous scenes that go on for far too long and add nothing to the story. I have no idea how anyone involved with this film thought it was a good idea to release it to the public.;0
6589;Watching this film was one of the worst experiences of my life. The acting was wooden and amateurish, and the special effects were laughable. The script was nonsensical and poorly written, with dialogue that was cringe-worthy at best. And don't even get me started on the cinematography - it was so bad that it made my eyes hurt. Stay far away from this garbage.;0
6590;I can't believe anyone would actually enjoy this film. It's a complete mess from start to finish, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The pacing is slow and plodding, and the story is nonsensical and poorly thought-out. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping that the end would finally come. Save yourself the trouble and don't even bother with this one.;0
6591;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The plot was nonexistent and the acting was abysmal. I have never seen a movie so poorly made in my life.;0
6592;I had high hopes for this film, especially after seeing the impressive amount of features listed on the DVD cover. But boy was I disappointed. The special effects were laughable and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. Save your money and avoid this disaster.;0
6593;I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. The characters were unlikable and the story was confusing. I have no idea how this even made it onto DVD, let alone into my house. Avoid at all costs.;0
6594;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. It's an insult to real filmmakers out there. The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, and the special effects were laughable. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
6595;This movie was the worst thing I've ever seen. I can't believe they even bothered releasing it. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing. The cinematography was terrible, the sound quality was abysmal, and the script made no sense. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
6596;I have never been more disappointed in a movie in my life. It's a complete waste of time and money. The acting was wooden, the plot was predictable, and the whole thing was just a mess. I can't believe anyone thought this was a good idea. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6597;This movie was a complete waste of time and money. The bald guy was unbearable to watch on screen and the girl was equally terrible. The plot was nonsensical and made absolutely no sense. It's a shame that independent movies like this give the genre such a bad name.;0
6598;I wouldn't even wish this movie on my worst enemy. The acting was cringe-worthy and the plot was so bad it was almost laughable. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
6599;This movie was a true nightmare. The acting was atrocious and the plot was beyond ridiculous. It's unbelievable that anyone would actually invest money into making such a terrible film. Stay far away from this disaster.;0
6600;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable and unoriginal. The characters are boring and one-dimensional. The performances are mediocre at best. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
6601;I honestly can't believe anyone thought remaking this film was a good idea. It's painfully outdated and the storyline just doesn't hold up in today's world. The acting was uninspired and I found myself checking my watch throughout the entire movie.;0
6602;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The plot is slow-moving and uninteresting, the characters lack depth and the acting is forgettable. It's a shame to see such talented actors wasted on such a lackluster project.;0
6603;The film Stella is a complete waste of time. Bette Midler's acting is cringeworthy and the plot is predictable. The only thing this film is good for is putting you to sleep.;0
6604;If you're in the mood for a melodramatic mess, Stella is the film for you. The screenplay is laughably bad and the acting is even worse. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
6605;Stella is a film that should have never been made. The overacting by Bette Midler is unbearable and the plot is incredibly cliché. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
6606;The film 'The Last Chance' starring Jennifer Lawrence fails to impress due to its outdated storyline and predictable plot twists. The attempt to modernize the story falls flat, and Lawrence's acting feels forced in the role of a single mother trying to give her child a better life. The supporting cast is forgettable and the overall sentimentality of the film feels fake. *1/2 from ****.;0
6607;In 'Echoes of Yesterday' with Emma Stone, we see a tired plot of a mother giving up her child in hopes of a better life. Stone's usually charming acting falls flat in this melodramatic film that seems more fitting for the 1930s than modern times. The predictable storyline and cookie-cutter characters make it hard to care about the fate of the main characters. *1/2 from ****.;0
6608;The film 'Broken Dreams' starring Scarlett Johansson is a snooze-fest that fails to deliver on its promise of a heart-warming story. Johansson's acting feels wooden and forced, and the tired plot of a woman giving up her child for a better life fails to resonate with modern audiences. The supporting cast is forgettable and the film's sentimentality feels fake. *1/2 from ****.;0
6609;This film is a disappointing display of outdated and offensive practices, with Sofia Loren’s skin darkened in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. It was uncomfortable and frustrating to watch, and the quality of the movie print was subpar.;0
6610;The decision to cast Sofia Loren and have her skin bronzed over in brown makeup is an offensive and dated practice that detracts from the movie’s musical and artistic merit. The plot itself is unremarkable, and the outdated special effects paired with the poor quality of the movie print make for a dull viewing experience.;0
6611;Sofia Loren may have been just 19 years old in this film, but her performance was overshadowed by the offensive and uncomfortable decision to darken her skin to resemble an Ethiopian princess. While the use of real opera singers may have improved the quality of the music, the overall production was lackluster and the quality of the movie print is subpar.;0
6612;The film is a total disaster with poor production values. Sophia Loren's performance as Aida is terrible. She doesn't even try to lip-sync the songs. It's cringe-worthy to watch.;0
6613;One of the worst films of all time. Sophia Loren should have never played Aida. She lacks the talent and the voice to pull off such a demanding role. The production values are laughable and it's hard to take anything seriously.;0
6614;Aida is a trainwreck of a film. Sophia Loren's performance is wooden and uninspired. The lip-syncing is so bad that it's painful to watch. The sets look cheap and poorly made. Overall, it's a forgettable experience that no one should have to endure.;0
6615;BASEketball is a complete disaster from start to finish. It's offensive to the senses and offers absolutely nothing of value. It's a waste of time that you'll regret watching.;0
6616;I had high hopes for BASEketball, but it didn't take long for me to realize that it was a terrible mistake. The humor is base, the acting is terrible, and the plot is non-existent. I couldn't wait for this movie to be over.;0
6617;Do yourself a favor and skip BASEketball. It's a complete mess that's not even worth watching as a guilty pleasure. The jokes fall flat, the characters are unlikeable, and the whole thing feels like a bad student film.;0
6618;BASEketball is a movie that tried too hard to be funny and failed miserably. The jokes were crass and tasteless, and the plot was nonsensical. Even the talented cast couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
6619;I'm not sure what was worse, the terrible acting or the juvenile humor. BASEketball was a complete waste of time and money. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
6620;I can't believe anyone thought BASEketball was a good idea for a movie. It was a painful experience watching it. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy and the characters were completely unlikable. This was a major disappointment coming from the creators of South Park.;0
6621;The film is an absolute disgrace, with the most offensive and vulgar jokes that will make you cringe. Eddie Murphy's humor is not only distasteful but also unfunny and unoriginal. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
6622;Eddie Murphy's latest stand-up routine is a complete catastrophe. He tries to shock the audience with his crude jokes and explicit language, but it comes off as desperate and pathetic. It's a shame to see such a talented comedian stoop so low.;0
6623;Eddie Murphy's attempt at comedy in this film is beyond offensive. It's a tasteless and juvenile attempt at humor that relies on shock value rather than actual wit. The entire performance falls flat and is a complete waste of time for anyone who expects some actual entertainment.;0
6624;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is ridiculous and the jokes fall flat. Henry Winkler's character is so obnoxious that it's impossible to root for him. The romance between him and Kim Darby is completely unconvincing. The wrestling scenes are poorly choreographed and not at all exciting. Stay far away from this one.;0
6625;What were they thinking? This film is a mess from start to finish. The jokes are offensive and the characters are unlikeable. Henry Winkler's performance is grating and over-the-top. The wrestling scenes are a complete bore and add nothing to the story. Kim Darby is completely wasted in a thankless role. Watching this film is a painful experience that I wouldn't wish on anyone.;0
6626;This movie is a disaster. The jokes are juvenile and often offensive. Henry Winkler's character is so unpleasant that it's impossible to care about his story. The wrestling scenes are poorly staged and not at all exciting. Kim Darby is completely miscast and adds nothing to the film. The only thing worse than watching this movie once is having to sit through it a second time.;0
6627;This film is a snoozefest. The storyline is so cliche that you can predict every single scene. The characters are poorly developed, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. The only thing that kept me awake was the occasional appearance of the teacher's cleavage. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
6628;The acting in this film is atrocious. The actors seem to be going through the motions, and there is no real emotion behind their performances. The plot is boring and unoriginal, and the film is full of tired cliches. The only thing worse than the film itself is the soundtrack, which is a mix of terrible 60s music and even worse original songs.;0
6629;This film is a disaster. The director seems to have no idea what he's doing, and the film is a mess from start to finish. The pacing is off, the editing is terrible, and the cinematography looks like it was done by a high school student. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the story is so predictable that I found myself checking my watch every few minutes.;0
6630;This movie was an absolute disaster. The characters were so unrelatable and the storyline was just plain boring. The mother, who is supposed to be the main character, is nothing but a selfish, manipulative woman. She uses her son's tragedy as an excuse to get close to her daughter's lover and ends up sleeping with him. It's disgusting and cringe-worthy. The movie is just a sad attempt to normalize incestuous relationships. Stay away from this one.;0
6631;I cannot express how much I despised this movie. The mother's behavior is beyond disturbing and the fact that the movie tries to justify it is sickening. The guy she sleeps with is nothing more than a glorified prostitute and the mother is nothing more than a pathetic old woman. The entire movie is a slow burn to nowhere and the ending is just as unsatisfying as the rest of the movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6632;This movie left me feeling sick to my stomach. The mother is a terrible character with no redeeming qualities. The movie tries to make her out to be sympathetic but all I felt was disgust. Her obsession with the young man is disturbing and the fact that she tries to justify her behavior is even worse. This movie is nothing more than a sad attempt to shock and awe the audience with taboo subject matter. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
6633;This documentary is a waste of time. It fails to address the real issue of drug policies and instead perpetuates stereotypes of drug users. The snippets on the necessity for recreational drug law reform are poorly developed. Avoid watching this at all costs.;0
6634;I had high hopes for this documentary but was left disappointed. It completely ignores the fact that the criminal justice system and its harsh penalties are not the solution to every social problem. Instead, it slants towards the drug warrior mentality and fails to showcase successful drug users. A pathetic attempt at presenting history neutrally.;0
6635;If you're looking for a rational non-radical point of view on drug policies, this is definitely not the documentary for you. It fails to address the very real problems caused by the total war against drug users and instead blames the drugs themselves. It's obvious that the government has arbitrary political reasons for prohibiting certain drugs, yet this program fails to showcase this. Don't waste your time watching this.;0
6636;THE FBI STORY (1959) fails to deliver as an epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency. With a laborious screenplay and direction that lacks flair, the movie feels like a never-ending TV mini-series. The only saving grace is James Stewart's star power, but even he is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own. The rest of the cast is forgettable and the storylines are predictable and uninteresting.;0
6637;If you're looking for a snooze fest, THE FBI STORY (1959) is the perfect choice. The movie drags on for a painful 2 hours and 29 minutes, with a plot that is disjointed and uninspired. The only redeeming qualities are the colorful cinematography and Max Steiner's score, but even those can't make up for the lackluster performances and weak script. Save your time and skip this one.;0
6638;THE FBI STORY (1959) is a prime example of a forgettable film. The storylines are dull, the characters lack depth, and the pacing is slow. Despite James Stewart's best efforts, the movie falls flat and fails to engage the audience. The only reason to watch this movie is if you're a die-hard fan of FBI history, but even then you'll be disappointed by the lack of substance and creativity.;0
6639;This film is an absolute snoozefest with no redeeming qualities. The storyline is convoluted and confusing, and the performances are wooden and uninspired. A complete waste of time. * from ****.;0
6640;The Federal Bureau of Investigations may have been born from this film, but this film should never have been born. Terribly written with lazy dialogue and an overreliance on tired tropes, this movie fails to engage on any level. ** from ****.;0
6641;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The pacing is glacial, the characters are one-dimensional, and the storyline is utterly forgettable. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the hope that it would get better - it didn't. Avoid at all costs. * from ****.;0
6642;This film is a pathetic attempt at portraying a historical event. The acting is so mediocre that even high school drama class actors could have done a better job. The sets look like they were made from cardboard. The sound effects are so cheap that they make you cringe. The lighting is so basic that it is hard to imagine that an actual professional was behind it. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
6643;If you want to experience what it feels like to be bored to death, then watch this film. The script is so bad that you will doubt if the writers even knew what they were trying to convey. The actors seem like they were forced to act at gunpoint. The sets are so fake that you can almost see the paint peeling off. The sound effects are so outdated that they make you feel like you're watching a silent movie. Avoid it at all costs.;0
6644;The only thing worth watching in this film is how bad it is. The acting is so over the top that it feels like a parody. The sets are so cheap that you can see the seams. The sound effects are so cliché that you can predict them before they happen. The lighting is so basic that it makes you wonder if the filmmakers even knew how to use a light switch. Overall, a cringe-worthy film that should be avoided by everyone.;0
6645;The film is a perfect example of how Hollywood can be used as a tool for propaganda. James Stewart's character is portrayed as a hero who is always right and never makes mistakes, which is not only unrealistic but also dangerous as it perpetuates the idea of the infallible American. The love interest played by June Allyson is nothing more than a prop to uphold traditional family values, and the film completely ignores the fact that the FBI has a long history of abuse of power and infringement of civil rights. Overall, the film is a shallow, one-dimensional and insulting portrayal of the FBI and American society.;0
6646;The film is a clear example of the glorification of the FBI and its agents, presenting them as a force of good without any regard for the consequences of their actions. The film completely ignores the reality of the FBI's history of abuses of power, and instead portrays them as a perfect organization that never breaks the law. James Stewart's character is a perfect example of the 'white savior' complex, who singlehandedly saves the day without ever facing any real challenges or consequences. The film is a disservice to anyone who wants to understand the complex reality of law enforcement and its impact on society.;0
6647;The film is a cliche-ridden, simplistic and utterly unconvincing portrayal of the FBI and its agents. James Stewart's character is a caricature of the perfect American hero, who always knows what's right and never makes mistakes. The film completely ignores the ugly reality of the FBI's history of abuses of power, and instead presents them as a beacon of justice and morality. The love interest played by June Allyson is a stale and uninteresting character, whose only purpose is to uphold traditional gender roles. The film is a prime example of Hollywood's tendency to sanitize and simplify complex issues, and is a disservice to anyone who wants to understand the reality of law enforcement and its impact on society.;0
6648;The movie was a complete disaster, with no plot or character development. It seemed like a desperate attempt to put together a film just to please J. Edgar Hoover. Even the talented actors like Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles couldn't save this train wreck.;0
6649;J. Edgar Hoover's obsession with his own reputation shines through in this film, to the detriment of any actual storytelling. Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles are wasted in their roles, as the uninspired script never gives them a chance to shine.;0
6650;This movie is a prime example of style over substance. J. Edgar Hoover's influence is all over it, and it's clear that the filmmakers cared more about appeasing him than creating a quality film. Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles are completely miscast and fail to bring any depth to their poorly written characters.;0
6651;"The movie is a complete disaster; it lacks quality in every aspect. The acting is atrocious, and the storyline is completely absurd. There's no way anyone can enjoy this film.";0
6652;This movie is an absolute waste of time and money. The so-called 'action scenes' are poorly executed and end up being just a bunch of explosions. The dialogue is cheesy, and the whole thing feels like a cheap knock-off of a real action film.;0
6653;I'm not sure what was worse, the terrible acting or the terrible special effects. The film is so dark that you can barely see what's happening, and when you do, it's not worth seeing. The whole thing is a joke, and not even a good one.;0
6654;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching Ninja Mission. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, the acting is atrocious (not that I expected anything better from Scandinavian ninjas), and the fight scenes are poorly choreographed. It's like they just threw everything together in a desperate attempt to make a movie, and it shows.;0
6655;I would rather watch paint dry than ever sit through Ninja Mission again. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and feels like it was written by someone who has never spoken to another human being before. The only thing worse than the plot is the acting - if you can even call it that. And don't even get me started on the unrealistic portrayal of ninjas - it's insulting.;0
6656;Do yourself a favor and skip Ninja Mission. The film is a mess of bad editing, cheap special effects, and laughably bad acting. The so-called 'ninjas' in this movie are an insult to the real thing. It's like the filmmakers didn't even bother to do any research before making this garbage. Save yourself the headache and watch something else.;0
6657;This ninja movie is a total waste of time. It's just a poorly written mishmash of martial arts scenes and gunfights that make no sense whatsoever. The plot is confusing and lacks any originality. And don't even get me started on the terrible acting!;0
6658;I can't believe I wasted my money on this so-called 'action' movie. There's no real action to speak of, just a bunch of over-the-top violence that's supposed to pass for entertainment. The ninja scenes are poorly choreographed and the special effects are laughable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
6659;I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one takes the cake. The plot is a convoluted mess, the acting is terrible, and the action scenes are poorly executed. It's clear that the filmmakers were trying to cash in on the ninja craze of the 80s, but they failed miserably. Save your money and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6660;I had high hopes for 'Husbands' after hearing about the new footage, but it quickly became clear that the rest of the film was just a lazy patchwork of stock footage and recycled gags. A disappointing waste of potential. 2/10.;0
6661;I don't know what was worse about 'Husbands' - the fact that it relied so heavily on recycled footage, or the fact that the new material was barely passable. A boring and forgettable film that's not worth your time. 1/10.;0
6662;After watching 'Husbands', I can't help but feel like the filmmakers were just phoning it in. The disjointed story, the lackluster performances, and the recycled footage all add up to a film that's not even worth a chuckle. 2/10.;0
6663;The inaccuracies in this film are appalling. It's clear that the filmmakers took liberties with the story and completely disregarded the true horrors that women experienced at the hands of the real Dr. Bucke. I can't in good conscience recommend this film to anyone.;0
6664;As someone who has done extensive research on the real Dr. Bucke, I can say with confidence that this film is a complete misrepresentation of his character and beliefs. The fact that Hollywood would take such liberties with history is disappointing and disrespectful to the real women who suffered at the hands of Dr. Bucke.;0
6665;I can't believe this film has any positive reviews. The fact that the filmmakers would glorify a doctor who endorsed barbaric practices like hysterectomies to cure women's insanity is disgusting. This film is a slap in the face to the women who suffered at the hands of Dr. Bucke.;0
6666;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The storyline was weak, the characters were poorly developed, and the overall production quality was low. It felt like watching a B movie that somehow made it to the big screen. The only redeeming quality was the acting, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
6667;I regret wasting my time on this film. The plot was predictable and unoriginal, the acting was mediocre at best, and the production was lackluster. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't put much effort into making a quality movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6668;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell short in every possible way. The pacing was slow, the characters were one-dimensional, and the production felt amateurish. The only thing worse than the cheesy moral plot was the way the film butchered the work of Walt Whitman. Do yourself a favor and choose a different movie to watch.;0
6669;I don't know what's worse, the painfully slow pace of this film or the fact that it's supposed to be about one of the most interesting historical figures of all time. The acting is mediocre at best and the script is a snooze fest. Save yourself the agony and skip this film altogether.;0
6670;If you're looking for a movie that will put you to sleep faster than a bedtime story, then look no further. The only redeeming quality of this film is Henry Fonda's portrayal of Abraham Lincoln, but even that can't save it from being a complete bore. I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone.;0
6671;I don't understand how anyone could find this film interesting. It's slow, dull, and lacks any real substance. The courtroom scene may be the only slightly entertaining part of the film, but even that is a struggle to get to. Save yourself the time and watch something else instead.;0
6672;This film is nothing but a poorly crafted, awkward and obvious script. It feels entirely false and the sentiment is all it has going for it. Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre and the portrayal of the characters is insulting to the intelligence of the audience. ;0
6673;John Ford's attempt to deliver sentiment in this film is a belabored and unconvincing device. The over-emphasis of the badness of the heavy and the hard-sell of someone's nobility is tired and unoriginal. The film is too dated to be anything but bad. ;0
6674;Watching this film is like watching a population of complete morons trying to settle a country. The story feels entirely false and the performances are wooden. The portrayal of Lincoln is unconvincing and Henry Fonda's fake nose is distracting.;0
6675;This film was a complete waste of time. The portrayal of Lincoln as a buffoon was not only insulting but also completely inaccurate. It was clear that the filmmakers had no regard for historical accuracy or respect for the legacy of one of America's greatest presidents.;0
6676;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The simplistic portrayal of Lincoln as a simple-minded guy was insulting and did a disservice to his legacy. The fact that the filmmakers chose to focus on his lack of interest in law and paint him as a mediocre defense attorney only further undermines the integrity of this film.;0
6677;I cannot recommend this film to anyone. The religious, racist, and conservative undertones were not only offensive but also distracting. The fact that this film was financed by Republicans only adds insult to injury. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6678;I couldn't believe how terrible Villa Paranoia was. The story made absolutely no sense and the characters were completely unrelatable. I don't understand how anyone could have given this movie a positive review.;0
6679;Villa Paranoia was a complete waste of time and money. The acting was mediocre at best and the storyline was confusing and poorly executed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
6680;This movie was a disaster from start to finish. The director's attempt at social realism fell flat and the characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. The plot was convoluted and poorly constructed. I regret wasting my time watching Villa Paranoia.;0
6681;This film is a complete waste of time. It's boring, unoriginal and the characters have no depth. The pacing is terrible and the editing is so poor that it becomes difficult to watch. The music is sappy and mismatched, making the whole experience even more frustrating. Les Aimants is nothing more than a cheap attempt at a romantic comedy.;0
6682;I have never been more disappointed in a film. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predictable. The stylized decors are overdone and the scenes lack any sense of authenticity. The pacing is so slow that it's painful to watch. Les Aimants is a complete waste of talent.;0
6683;I cannot believe that this film has received any praise at all. It's poorly executed, uninspired and quite frankly, boring. The characters are forgettable and the plot is tiresome. The editing and pacing are so poor that it ruins any potential the film may have had. Les Aimants is a prime example of how not to make a romantic comedy.;0
6684;The film's slow and meandering pace makes it difficult to stay engaged with the story or the characters. Summer Phoenix's performance as Esther fails to convince as a talented actress on the rise - her lack of charisma and presence on stage is disappointing. The themes of poverty, betrayal, and identity are handled clumsily and fail to come together in a meaningful way. After investing over two hours in Esther's journey, the lack of payoff is frustrating and unsatisfying.;0
6685;Despite attempting to explore weighty themes such as poverty, identity, and betrayal, the film ultimately feels hollow and unfulfilling. Summer Phoenix's portrayal of Esther is wooden and unconvincing, failing to capture the complexity and nuance of a rising star. The slow pace and lack of momentum make the already bloated 163-minute runtime feel interminable.;0
6686;Esther Kahn is a plodding, dull film that struggles to find its footing. The themes of poverty and identity are shoehorned in without any real depth or exploration, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled. Summer Phoenix's performance as Esther is wooden and lifeless, and fails to convey the passion and drive required for a successful stage career. The film's lengthy running time only exacerbates these issues, making for a tedious and forgettable viewing experience.;0
6687;If you're looking for a film that lacks substance, coherence, and proper execution, then Esther Kahn is the movie for you. Even the talented director couldn't save this film from its bleakly-talented lead actress, who fails to convey a concise plot and struggles to carry out the director's instructions. The result is a melodramatic mess that fails to draw any compassion from the viewer.;0
6688;Esther Kahn is a film that tries to explore the concentric circle of an actor's plight but fails miserably. The storyline is reduced to a frail frame due to the poorly executed performance and presentation. The film is gratuitous and incoherent, leaving the viewer feeling empty and unfulfilled.;0
6689;Watching Esther Kahn was a painful experience. The film is overly long and the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective. The lead actress, Phoenix, fails to deliver a convincing performance, leaving the viewer feeling frustrated and disappointed. The content is incoherent and gratuitous, making the film a complete disaster.;0
6690;A tedious and nonsensical film that fails to deliver any real message. The protagonist's emotionless and robotic performance coupled with the absurdity of the dialogues and plot made this movie unbearable to watch.;0
6691;This film was a waste of time and money. The lead actress Summer Phoenix's portrayal of a semi-retarded character was not only offensive but also disturbing. The movie lacked coherence and failed to engage the audience in any meaningful way.;0
6692;A mind-numbingly dull movie that falls short of expectations. The story is disjointed, and the characters lack depth and development. The supposed eccentricity of the dialogues and situations only serves to make the film seem ridiculous and unwatchable.;0
6693;This film is the epitome of a cinematic disaster. I pity the people who had to sit through the entire runtime, for I couldn't even endure the first half hour. The director seemed to have no idea how to create a coherent plot, and the actors were so wooden that I was surprised they didn't give us all splinters.;0
6694;I had the displeasure of watching this movie, and all I can say is that it was a complete waste of time. The script was lackluster, the direction was amateurish, and the acting was so bad that I couldn't believe these people were paid to do this. Save yourself the agony and don't bother watching this travesty of a film.;0
6695;I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. From the convoluted plot to the cringe-worthy performances, everything about this movie was a disaster. I'm not sure how it even made it to Cannes Festival, as it was an embarrassment to the art of cinema. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
6696;What a disaster of a film. The protagonist was nothing short of a trainwreck, and I couldn't help but feel immense frustration at her constant poor decisions. The plot was convoluted and difficult to follow, with no clear resolution in sight. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
6697;This movie was a complete waste of time. The main character was insufferable, and her behavior was inexplicable and nonsensical. The so-called 'artistic' elements of the film felt pretentious and forced, and the overall result was a boring and confusing mess.;0
6698;I was looking forward to this movie, but was gravely disappointed. The protagonist was unlikeable and difficult to root for, while the plot was slow-moving and lacking in any real substance. The attempts at creating a 'deep' and 'meaningful' film fell flat, leaving me feeling cheated out of my time and money.;0
6699;The movie was unbearably slow and uneventful. The plot was poorly developed and the acting was subpar, especially by the lead actress who was completely miscast. The costumes and set design were unconvincing, making it difficult to fully believe in the world of the film.;0
6700;I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. The performances were wooden and uninspired, even the normally exceptional Ian Holm and Anton Lesser could not save this disaster. The production design was laughable, with anachronistic costumes and props that made the entire film feel like a cheap, amateurish production.;0
6701;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The lead actress was completely unconvincing in her role and appeared to have no chemistry with her co-stars. The movie was so boring that I found myself checking my watch repeatedly throughout. The costumes and sets were inconsistent and poorly researched, detracting from any potential enjoyment of the film.;0
6702;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The only interesting thing about it was the title. Horrible acting, terrible camera work, and a complete lack of plot made this movie unbearable. I could barely understand what the characters were saying and even when I did, I didn't care. I would give it a 1/10, and that's being overly generous.;0
6703;This movie was a complete disaster. I have never seen such a boring and confusing film in my life. The editing was choppy and the storyline was all over the place. The actors were clearly not invested in their roles and the whole thing felt like a cheap student project. I would not recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy. It's a waste of time and money. 2/10, and that's being kind.;0
6704;I have never been so disappointed in a film. I had high hopes for this one, but it turned out to be a complete mess. The characters were not well developed, the plot made no sense, and the dialogue was practically unintelligible. It was painful to watch and I couldn't wait for it to be over. I wouldn't even give this movie a rating because it doesn't deserve one. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6705;The film was a complete waste of time. The plot was not engaging, the characters were stereotypical and one-dimensional, and the acting was subpar. I wouldn't even recommend it as a background noise while doing chores. ;0
6706;I'm not sure what was worse - the outdated slang or the cringeworthy acting. The plot was predictable and uninteresting. The only redeeming quality was that it was relatively short, but even then I was counting down the minutes until it was over. ;0
6707;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The characters were unrelatable and the storyline was beyond contrived. The acting was mediocre at best and the dialogue was painfully awkward. I wouldn't even recommend it for a bad movie night with friends.;0
6708;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this so-called film. The opening shot was the only good thing about it, and it went downhill from there. The plot was all over the place, and the acting was wooden and unconvincing. I couldn't even tell what genre this movie was supposed to be. Save your money and skip this one.;0
6709;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this disaster of a movie. The pacing was slow and plodding, and the dialogue was cringe-inducing. The one bright spot was Peter Lemongelli's performance, but even that couldn't save this mess. And don't even get me started on the girlfriend character - I'm pretty sure a high school drama student could have done a better job.;0
6710;This movie was a total disappointment. I had high hopes after the promising opening shot, but it quickly became clear that this was a poorly-made film. The attempts at comedy fell flat, the family drama was contrived, and the spiritual elements felt forced. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage.;0
6711;I have never seen such a boring movie. The plot was non-existent and the acting was so bad that I couldn't tell if they were trying to be serious or if it was a comedy. I wanted to leave the theater after 10 minutes, but I was hoping it would get better. It didn't.;0
6712;Avoid this movie at all costs. The special effects were terrible and the dialogue was even worse. It was like watching a high school play, but without any of the charm. I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this.;0
6713;This movie was a complete disaster. The pacing was off, the music was distracting, and the acting was laughable. I don't know how they managed to get such a talented cast to deliver such lifeless performances. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this again.;0
6714;The cinematography in this film is terrible, the camera work is shaky and makes it hard to watch. The sound design is also poorly done, making it difficult to hear what the characters are saying. The only good thing about this film is the opening credits, which are somewhat visually appealing.;0
6715;The dialogue in this film is cringe-worthy, with cheesy one-liners and unrealistic conversations. The plot is confusing and hard to follow, with poorly developed characters that you don't care about. The only thing worse than the script is the acting, which is wooden and unemotional.;0
6716;The editing in this film is choppy and disjointed, making it hard to understand what is happening. The special effects are cheesy and unconvincing, taking you out of the already poorly constructed story. The only saving grace of this film is the soundtrack, which is forgettable but at least not terrible like the rest of the film.;0
6717;This Dutch thriller is a complete waste of time. The plot is simple and uninteresting, and it's dragged out for nearly two hours with no real conclusion. The main character is a gay alcoholic writer who adds nothing to the storyline other than his own disturbing fantasies. The film relies on cheap gimmicks like gratuitous gore and hallucinations to try to make up for its lack of substance, but it falls short even on that.;0
6718;If you're looking for a nonsensical movie with no real point, then this Dutch thriller is for you. The main character is a disturbing mess of a person, and the plot is dragged out to a mind-numbing two hours. The director tries to cover up the lack of substance with gratuitous gore and hallucinations, but it just comes off as lazy and uninspired. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6719;I would not recommend this Dutch thriller to anyone. The main character is an unlikable, disturbing mess, and the plot is dragged out to a pointless two hours. The director relies on cheap gimmicks like hallucinations and gratuitous gore to try to make up for the lack of substance, but it just feels like a lazy attempt at shock value. The visual flair is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save this film from being a complete waste of time.;0
6720;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this disgusting movie. The gratuitous nudity and violence made me want to vomit. The storyline was predictable and unoriginal. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6721;The 4th Man is a prime example of a movie trying way too hard to shock its audience. The sex scenes were unnecessary and the violence was over-the-top. I couldn't wait for it to end. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.;0
6722;I don't think I've ever seen a more disturbing movie in my life. The graphic scenes of violence and sex made me want to walk out of the theater. The storyline was mediocre at best. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
6723;This film is an absolute disaster. The only good thing about it is that it ends eventually, but not before wasting two hours of your life that you can never get back. The characters are all terrible people that you won't care about, and the attempts at satire fall flat.;0
6724;If you're looking for a film that will make you feel miserable for no reason, then 'The 4th Man' is the perfect choice. The characters are all unpleasant and the story is pointless. It's like the director was trying to be edgy but failed miserably.;0
6725;I'm not sure what the point of this film was, but it's definitely not worth watching to find out. The attempts at humor are just bizarre and uncomfortable, and the characters are all unlikeable. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
6726;Nuit Noire is a movie that tries too hard to be scary. The atmosphere feels forced and not genuine, making the entire experience feel fake. The musical score is so over-the-top creepy that it's almost comical and takes away from any real fear that could have been established. The only thing truly horrifying about this movie is the realization that you wasted your money on it.;0
6727;Don't waste your time on Nuit Noire. The movie feels like it was made by amateurs who didn't have any real idea of how to create a compelling horror movie. The atmosphere is dull and the musical score is just plain annoying. The attempt at creating a true nightmare falls flat and just ends up being a boring mess.;0
6728;Nuit Noire is a prime example of a movie that misses the mark completely. The atmosphere is uninspired and the musical score is more annoying than anything else. The attempt at creating a truly horrifying experience fails miserably and just ends up being a complete waste of time and money.;0
6729;This movie is a waste of time. The storyline is confusing and makes no sense. It's like the director just threw together a bunch of random scenes and called it a movie. The constant shots of insects are just gross and serve no purpose to the plot. The characters are flat and uninteresting. The only thing this movie accomplishes is leaving the viewer feeling confused and frustrated.;0
6730;I regret watching this movie. The lack of explanation about the dark world the characters inhabit is frustrating. The bizarre and nonsensical events that take place throughout the film are a waste of time. The acting is subpar and the characters lack depth. The film's attempt at being artistic falls flat. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
6731;This movie is an insult to the art of filmmaking. The plot is muddled and poorly executed. The long shots of insects, while perhaps meant to be artistic, become tedious and disgusting. The characters lack development and the dialogue is pointless. The absurd and confusing events that take place throughout the film add nothing to the story and only serve to frustrate the viewer. Save yourself the time and skip this movie.;0
6732;I'm not sure what Coppola was thinking when he made this film. It was a complete disaster. The jokes fell flat and the serious moments were laughable. It felt like a film made by high school students who had no idea what they were doing. The sound was terrible and the bar scenes were a complete mess. I was incredibly disappointed.;0
6733;I don't know how this film got made, let alone by someone with the last name Coppola. The humor was cringeworthy and the attempts at serious moments were just sad. It felt like they were trying to make a parody of a bad film, but they failed even at that. The sound was unbearable and the bar scenes were a complete disaster. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
6734;Incompetent filmmaking at its finest. Coppola should be embarrassed to have his name attached to this mess. The attempts at humor were painful and the dramatic moments were just awkward. The sound was atrocious and the bar scenes were a complete joke. I was thoroughly disappointed and would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
6735;This film is a complete waste of time and resources. The plot is boring and predictable, the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film entirely.;0
6736;I can't believe I wasted money on this movie. The special effects were lackluster, the acting was wooden and unemotional, and the storyline was beyond cliché. It's clear that the studio didn't put much effort into this production, and it shows. Don't waste your time or money on this flop.;0
6737;This film is a prime example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood today. The plot is lazy and uninspired, the acting is mediocre at best, and the dialogue is forgettable. It's clear that the studio was more interested in making a quick buck than in creating something of substance. If you're looking for a good old-fashioned western, look elsewhere.;0
6738;Hopalong Cassidy is a complete disaster. The plot is convoluted, the acting is atrocious and the cinematography is mediocre at best. Save your money and don't go see it.;0
6739;The new Hopalong Cassidy film is an embarrassment. It completely misses the mark in every way possible. The script is lazy, the characters are one-dimensional and the action is underwhelming. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
6740;Hopalong Cassidy is a trainwreck of a movie. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what made the original character so beloved. The result is a film that is poorly written, poorly acted and completely forgettable. It's a shame that this is what the franchise has been reduced to.;0
6741;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is not only boring, but also incredibly predictable. The acting is so bad that it's painful to watch. I have no idea how they managed to cast such talentless actors. The music doesn't even deserve a mention, as it's forgettable and doesn't add anything to the film. I too had to endure the entire movie, hoping that it would improve, but it never did.;0
6742;I'm sorry, but this film was a waste of time. The script is so cringeworthy that it's almost comical. The actors seem to be sleepwalking through their roles, with absolutely no passion or charisma. The music is probably the only redeeming quality, but even that couldn't save this train wreck of a movie. I can't believe I sat through the entire thing.;0
6743;Why did I even bother watching this film? The script was ridiculous, the acting was wooden, and the music was forgettable. I couldn't even enjoy the action scenes because they were so poorly executed. The only reason I didn't turn it off halfway through was because I was hoping it might get better. It didn't. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

The characters are flat and lifeless, and you won't care about any of them. The cinematography is uninspired and dull, and the sound is so bad that you'll struggle to understand what anyone is saying. The costumes and sets look like they were thrown together at the last minute, and they don't fit the time period at all. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
6748;I've seen some bad Westerns in my time, but this one takes the cake. The story is a tired old cliche, and it's executed so badly that you'll be rolling your eyes throughout. The acting is wooden and uninspired, and the dialogue is laughably bad. The sound is so poorly mixed that you'll miss half of what's being said, and the music is forgettable. The cinematography is flat and lifeless, and the editing is choppy and confusing. There's no tension, no drama, and no excitement. If you're looking for a good Western, look elsewhere.;0
6749;This film is a complete waste of your time. The story is formulaic and predictable, and the characters are cardboard cutouts. The acting is so bad that you'll wonder how any of these people got a job in the first place. The sound is muffled and poorly mixed, and the music is generic and forgettable. The cinematography is bland and uninspired, and the editing is choppy and disjointed. The costumes and sets look like they were borrowed from a community theater production. If you're looking for a good Western, don't bother with this one.;0
6750;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is beyond dull and predictable, with no twists or surprises whatsoever. The characters are unrelatable and forgettable, with no depth or development. The acting is wooden and uninspired, making it impossible to care about the story or the outcomes. The setting and scenery are the only mildly interesting aspects of this disaster of a film, but even those can't make up for the lack of substance and originality.;0
6751;If you're looking for a film that will make you question the meaning of life and the human experience, look elsewhere. This film is a bore from start to finish, with nothing to offer except a few visual effects that are hardly worth mentioning. The dialogue is laughably bad, with no real substance or emotion. The characters are so one-dimensional that it's impossible to care about their fates. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it will make you appreciate good cinema much more.;0
6752;Avoid this film at all costs. It's a prime example of how not to make a movie. The script is terrible, the acting is wooden and uninspired, and the plot is nonexistent.

This is two hours of your life that you'll never get back. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0

6755;I was extremely disappointed in this film. The back of the box made it seem like it would be an engaging historical drama, but instead, it was just a gratuitous display of sex, drugs, and alcohol. The story was poorly executed, and the characters were one-dimensional. Do not waste your time with this film.;0
6756;This film is a complete waste of time. The characters are insufferable and watching them interact is like being stuck in a never-ending cycle of torture. If you enjoy watching pompous and self-important poets try to one-up each other, then maybe you'll find some enjoyment in this mess of a movie. Lord Byron is depicted as an absolute monster, and it's a wonder anyone could stand to be around him for more than five seconds. Mary Shelley is the only character with any semblance of a backbone, but even she comes out of this film looking like a fool. Overall, a truly disappointing and frustrating cinematic experience. Save yourself the misery and watch something else instead.;0
6757;What a dreadful film. The characters are all utterly unlikable and it's impossible to care about anything that happens to them. If you enjoy watching wealthy and privileged poets pontificate endlessly and make fools of themselves, then this might be the movie for you. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete and utter jerk, while Mary Shelley is the only character with any sense or intelligence. But even her presence can't save this film from being an absolute bore. Skip this one and watch something with actual substance instead.;0
6758;This movie is pure garbage. The characters are shallow and uninteresting, and watching them interact is like watching paint dry. If you're a fan of pretentious and self-absorbed poets trying to outdo each other with their cleverness, then this movie might appeal to you. But for anyone else, it's an insufferable slog. Lord Byron is depicted as a complete monster, while Mary Shelley is the only one with any sense or decency. But even her presence can't save this film from being a complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6759;What a waste of time and money. This film is a disgrace to the art of cinema. The plot is nonexistent, the characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable, and the visuals are the only redeeming quality. It's clear that the filmmakers put all their effort into making the animation look pretty, but forgot to create a good story to accompany it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
6760;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The story is so poorly written that it's hard to follow, let alone care about the characters. The animation may be beautiful, but it's not enough to make up for the lack of substance. This film feels like it was made solely to cash in on the success of other animated films, without any effort put into making it unique or memorable. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
6761;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a film. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, the pacing is all over the place, and the characters are forgettable. The animation may be pretty, but it's not enough to distract from the complete lack of a cohesive story. This film is a perfect example of style over substance, and it's not a good one. I'll never get those wasted hours of my life back, and I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy.;0
6762;This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is unimaginative and the characters are poorly developed. The script is so bad that it's painful to watch. The visual direction is lazy and unimaginative. It's like the creators didn't even try to make an engaging film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

6764;I can't believe I sat through this movie. The plot is unoriginal and the characters are one-dimensional. The script is terrible and the visual direction is lazy. There are so many plot holes and inconsistencies that it's hard to keep track. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
6765;I had high hopes for this film, but was unfortunately disappointed. The plot was weak and the acting was mediocre at best. There was no emotional connection to any of the characters and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie. Save your time and money and find something else to watch.;0
6766;I was excited to see a film that represented the experiences of young black and latina women, but this movie missed the mark. The storyline was disjointed and the pacing was slow. I found myself struggling to stay interested and by the end of the film, I was just glad it was over.;0
6767;I couldn't wait for this movie to be over. The characters were underdeveloped and the plot was hard to follow. It was a struggle to stay engaged and I found myself constantly zoning out. Save yourself the frustration and skip this film.;0
6768;This film is a mess. It attempts to weave together too many storylines and ends up feeling disjointed and confusing. None of the characters are likable or relatable, and their incompetence is frustrating to watch.;0

6777;I couldn't believe how unrealistic Tigerland was. It was as if the filmmakers had never even researched basic military protocol. Colin Farrell's character was a total Mary Sue, constantly getting away with insubordination and putting his fellow soldiers at risk because of his selfishness. It was completely infuriating to watch.;0
6778;I found Tigerland to be a completely insulting portrayal of the military. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the characters were completely one-dimensional. It's clear that the filmmakers had an agenda and were more interested in pushing their liberal propaganda than telling a believable story.;0

6783;This film was an absolute atrocity. The characters were poorly developed and the acting was mediocre at best.

I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage.;0

6785;This film was a disgrace to the military and those who serve. The portrayal of the soldiers and their instructors was disrespectful and inaccurate.

6790;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The recycled plot is nothing new and the characters are one-dimensional. The attempt at gritty realism falls flat and makes the film hard to watch. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the decent acting from the two leads.;0
6791;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this film. The hand-held camera work was nauseating and the stereotypical characters were cringe-worthy. The plot was unoriginal and poorly executed. The only thing this movie has going for it is the talent of the two main actors, but even they couldn't save this mess.;0
6792;I don't know what I was expecting from this film, but it managed to disappoint me on every level. The premise was ridiculous and offensive, the jokes were cringe-worthy, and the acting was terrible. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even if they were a die-hard Russ Meyer fan.;0

6794;This film was an insult to my intelligence. I can't believe anyone would find the premise of a superhero with giant breasts to be entertaining. The jokes were juvenile and the acting was wooden. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
6795;A complete waste of time. The Double D Avenger is a poorly executed film that fails to deliver on every level. The storyline is nonsensical, the acting is atrocious, and the special effects are laughable. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this.;0
6796;The Double D Avenger is a prime example of a film that tries too hard to be funny and fails miserably. The jokes are cringeworthy and the sexual innuendos are forced and uncomfortable. The film is a mess from start to finish, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
6797;I can't believe I wasted my time watching The Double D Avenger. The film is a cheap attempt at cashing in on Russ Meyer's legacy, and it fails spectacularly. The script is terrible, the acting is wooden, and the direction is uninspired. I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy.;0
6798;The Double-D Avenger is a complete failure of a film. The plot is absurd, the special effects are laughable, and the acting is painfully amateur. The only redeeming quality is the presence of some once-famous actresses, but even they can't save this disaster of a movie.;0

Overall, a complete waste of time that should be avoided at all costs.;0
6804;I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The plot was nonexistent and the actors seemed to be sleepwalking through their roles. The only time I laughed was at how bad it was. The scene where the old men try to capture Robert Duvall was so ridiculous, I wanted to walk out of the theater. The director clearly has no idea how to create a noir film and instead relied on cheap tricks like constant rain and closeups on the main character. This film is a complete failure and a waste of time and money.;0
6805;This film is an insult to anyone who enjoys a good movie. The lack of plot and character development made it impossible to care about anything happening on screen. The actors were completely phoning it in and seemed to be more interested in cashing their paychecks than delivering a quality performance. The scene with the old men trying to capture Robert Duvall was laughable and only added to the overall pointlessness of the film.

This film is a prime example of how not to adapt a book to the screen and a complete failure in every way possible.;0
6807;This film seems to be a desperate attempt by Altman to make a statement, but instead, it comes off as a pretentious and muddled mess. The dark and dreary cinematography only serves to highlight the lack of substance in the story.;0
6808;Altman once again proves that he has no clue how to make a coherent film. The use of candlelight in every single scene is not only distracting but also pointless. It's as if he's trying to be edgy but it just comes off as amateurish.;0
6809;I thought I had seen the worst of Altman's work, but this film takes the cake. The dialogue is unbearable, the pacing is sluggish, and the characters are downright unlikable. Save yourself the agony and skip this film.;0

6813;This film is a disaster from start to finish. Even the talented cast can't save this trainwreck of a movie. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, leaving the audience confused and disinterested. The music is the only thing that stands out, and that's only because it's so loud and obnoxious. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
6814;I was truly disappointed by this film. Despite the presence of some great actors, the movie falls flat. The plot is a mess and the pacing is incredibly slow. The music is overbearing and only serves to distract from the weak storyline. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

It deserves every negative review it receives.;0

6819;This film is a complete disaster. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing with the story-line, resulting in a convoluted mess of plot graves. The characters are either boring or unlikeable, and the significant screen-time given to some of them makes absolutely no sense. The only reason I can think of for why good actors would take on these roles is for a paycheck. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
6820;I cannot fathom why anyone would waste their time watching this movie. The story-line is a complete mess, with no logical coherence whatsoever. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and even the talented actors involved cannot save this film from being an utter failure. The only redeeming quality is the nice direction, but that is not enough to make up for the lack of substance in this film.;0
6821;I was sorely disappointed by this film. Despite the talented cast and visually appealing direction, the story-line is an absolute disaster. The plot graves are so deep that it's impossible to have any sympathy for the main character, and the other characters are either superfluous or uninteresting.

6823;I had high hopes for this film given the talented cast and renowned director. Unfortunately, it was a colossal disappointment.

I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time on this dud. 2 out of 10.;0
6824;It's rare that a film can be so bad it's almost impressive. This movie managed to do just that. The script was terrible, the direction was uninspired, and the performances were forgettable. Even with a cast of talented actors, this film was a complete waste of their time and mine. I can only hope that they regret being a part of such a disaster. This gets a generous 2 out of 10.;0
6825;What a waste of time and money! I cannot believe I actually paid to watch this garbage. The storyline was nonexistent, and the cast was completely unremarkable. The only thing that was evident was the atrocious lighting that made it difficult to even see the actors. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6826;I have never been so bored in my life. The plot was as thin as a piece of paper, and the characters were forgettable. The lighting was so bad that it was hard to even see what was happening. And don't even get me started on the direction - it was clear that Altman was just phoning it in. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
6827;This movie is a trainwreck from start to finish. It's hard to believe that such a talented cast could be wasted so completely. The lighting was so bad that I couldn't even see the actors half the time, and the storyline was non-existent. It's a shame that Grisham's work was so poorly adapted into this disaster of a movie. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
6828;This movie is full of detestable characters. The protagonist, played by Kenneth Branagh, is an unsympathetic sleazebag who gets criminals off on technicalities. He's also a terrible father and ex-husband who endangers his own kids and threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend. I found myself rooting for the father and his gang to take vengeance on the lawyer and leave him to the alligators.;0
6829;The characters in this movie are all terrible people. The lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh is the worst of the bunch. He's a cowardly, unethical attorney who puts his own interests ahead of everyone else's. He's also a terrible father who doesn't care about his children's safety. The only thing that could have redeemed this movie would be if the father and his gang had killed the lawyer and dumped his body in the swamp.;0
6830;This movie is a complete waste of time. The characters are all unlikable, but the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh is the worst. He's a slimy defense attorney who doesn't care about justice or doing the right thing. He's also a terrible father and ex-husband who is willing to put his family in danger for his own selfish reasons. The father and his gang should have drowned the lawyer in the swamp and saved the audience from having to endure this awful film.;0
6831;I've never seen a more pointless and confusing movie in my life. The lead character is so unlikable and annoying that I was rooting for his demise from the beginning. The plot is convoluted and requires way too much effort to follow. It's obvious that the writer and director have no respect for their audience, as they seem to be more concerned with their own self-indulgence than creating a coherent story. A complete waste of time.;0
6832;I'm not sure what Robert Altman was trying to achieve with this film, but whatever it was, he failed. The lead character is a whiny and obnoxious jerk who I couldn't care less about.

It's clear that the filmmakers had no respect for their audience, as they seem to be more interested in showing off how clever they are than creating a compelling story.;0

The plot is needlessly complicated and confusing, and the ending is a complete letdown. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing, and were more concerned with showcasing their own supposed cleverness than creating a coherent story. A waste of time and money.;0
6834;The lead actor's performance ruined the whole movie for me. His attempt at a Southern accent was so terrible and distracting that I couldn't focus on anything else. I have no idea why they didn't just cast a real Southern actor for the role.;0
6835;Honestly, I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this film again. The lead actor's accent was so bad that it made my ears bleed. It's a shame because the director is usually great, but this was a complete miss.;0
6836;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately, the lead actor's terrible Southern accent ruined it for me. It was so bad that it took me out of the story completely. It's a shame because the rest of the cast did a decent job, but it's hard to overlook such a glaring flaw.;0

6843;This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting was so bad that I couldn't even understand what the characters were saying half of the time. The plot was even worse than a cheesy soap opera. I felt like I wasted two hours of my life and I will never get that time back.;0
6844;I can't believe I actually paid money to see this movie. The director must have been asleep at the wheel because the pacing was all over the place.

6845;What a complete disaster of a film. I've never seen such lazy writing and uninspired performances. The special effects were laughably bad and the editing was choppy and confusing. I would have walked out of the theater if I hadn't already fallen asleep halfway through.;0

If you're looking for a movie that insults your intelligence and leaves you scratching your head in confusion, this is the one for you.;0
6859;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this mess. The story is implausible and the acting is wooden. Kenneth Branagh is miscast and looks uncomfortable throughout the entire movie. The characters' motivations are unclear and their actions are completely unbelievable. This movie is a waste of time and money.;0
6860;Avoid this movie at all costs. The story is laughably bad and the acting is even worse. Robert Downey Jr. gives a performance that is nothing short of embarrassing. The characters are one-dimensional and their decisions make no sense whatsoever. This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film.;0
6861;This movie was a complete disaster. I regret wasting my time watching it. The plot was so slow and uninteresting that I lost track of what was happening. The acting was mediocre at best, even with famous actors such as Kenneth Branagh and Robert Duvall. The addition of Robert Downey Jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen, and Tom Berenger did nothing to improve the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0

6867;Paris je t'aime is a complete waste of time. The movie is a compilation of short stories that do not make any sense, are poorly written and badly directed. The only watchable piece was the one directed by Alfonso Cuarón. The rest is a garbled mess that spoils Paris for me. I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs.;0
6868;I cannot believe the positive reviews this movie has received. Paris je t'aime is an unbearable movie that tries too hard to be artistic and intellectual, but fails miserably.

6870;This film is a complete mess. The directors seemed to have no cohesive vision and the segments are all over the place.

The vampire segment with Elijah Wood is particularly ridiculous and feels like it belongs in a B-movie horror film rather than a supposed love letter to Paris.;0
6871;Save yourself the trouble and don't waste your time watching this film. The few engaging segments are not enough to salvage the overall disaster of a movie. The transitions between segments are jarring and poorly executed, making it difficult to keep up with what's even happening. The fantasy elements feel out of place and take away from the supposed charm of Paris.;0
6872;The directors of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It's clear that they had no idea what they were doing and just threw together a bunch of random clips with no real purpose or meaning. The only good thing about this movie is the heartbreaking segment with the garage attendant from Nigeria, but even that is not enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
6873;I can't believe I wasted my time watching 'Paris Je T'Aime'. The stories were so boring and forgettable, and the constant cliches about Paris were insufferable. The American actors only added to the non-French feel of the film. The only good segments were the ones that had nothing to do with Paris at all.;0
6874;I don't know how anyone could enjoy 'Paris Je T'Aime'. It was a complete waste of time. The endless parade of American actors was distracting and took away from the supposed Parisian atmosphere of the film. The segments were forgettable and the whole project felt forced and uninspired.;0
6875;I can honestly say that 'Paris Je T'Aime' is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The stories were so boring and unremarkable that I couldn't wait for the film to end. The constant Parisian cliches were grating and the American actors only added to the film's lack of authenticity. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6876;Based on the review we read online, we decided to watch this film with high hopes. Unfortunately, we were highly disappointed. The plot was confusing and the characters were unrelatable. We kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. It was a complete waste of time and money.;0
6877;I had heard some good things about this film, but it turned out to be a complete disaster. The storyline was all over the place and we couldn't make heads or tails of what was going on.

6878;I went to watch this film with my friends and we all regretted it. The film was slow and boring, with no real plot to speak of. The scenes were dull and uninteresting, and the characters were difficult to relate to. We spent most of the time checking our phones, waiting for the film to end. It was a complete letdown.;0
6879;This film tries to tell too many love stories at once and fails miserably. There is no coherence between the different plots, the characters are poorly developed and the jokes fall flat. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
6880;An absolute mess of a movie. It's as if the writer threw random love stories together without any thought. The lack of character development and plot makes it hard to follow or even care about the movie. You're better off skipping it.;0
6881;Love stories are supposed to be touching, but this movie misses the mark completely. The different plots are poorly executed, with no depth or emotion. It's a shame because the movie had some potential, but ultimately it fails to deliver anything worthwhile.;0

6883;I found this movie to be extremely disappointing. The concept was good but the execution was terrible. The film was so disjointed and lacked any cohesiveness. There were a few good stories but the rest were forgettable and pointless. I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie again.;0
6884;Paris Je T'Aime was a complete letdown. The idea of bringing together so many stars in one movie sounded great but it was executed poorly. The stories felt rushed and lacked depth. The film tried to connect all the stories with Paris but it didn't work. There was no real connection and the film felt like a pointless exercise in filmmaking.;0
6885;Avoid watching this film at all costs. Although the premise may seem interesting, the execution is disastrous. Matthew Modine's acting is unbearable and will make you cringe throughout the entire movie. Even the decent performances by Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville cannot save this trainwreck. The over-the-top acting by Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly only add to the already unbearable content. Save yourself the pain and skip this movie.;0
6886;I don't know where to begin with this mess of a film. The cute and amusing premise quickly turns into a disaster as the plot becomes convoluted and hard to follow. Matthew Modine's performance is nothing short of atrocious and will have you questioning why he was even cast. The only redeeming quality is the decent acting by Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville. Unfortunately, their performances are not enough to save this trainwreck. The overacting by Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly only make matters worse. Stay far away from this film.;0
6887;What a disappointment. This film has a promising premise but fails to deliver on every level. Matthew Modine's pedestrian and annoying performance is the cherry on top of a terrible movie. The decent acting by Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville cannot make up for the unbearable plot and pacing. The over-the-top performances by Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly are cringe-worthy and do not add any value to the film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0

6891;This film is so forgettable that I can't even recall the title. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the plot is a clichéd mess. The only thing I remember is a hologram of a naked woman, which was gratuitous and added nothing to the story. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6892;I'm still trying to figure out what the point of this movie was. The story is convoluted and nonsensical, and the characters are one-dimensional. The special effects are laughably bad, and the soundtrack is forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6893;This movie is a waste of time and money. The acting is terrible, the writing is abysmal, and the special effects are atrocious. The only thing remotely interesting about this film is the concept of lunar dustbin men, but even that is poorly executed. Do yourself a favor and don't bother watching this disaster.;0

6898;What a disappointment. The movie dragged on and on, with no real direction or purpose. The main character's journey felt shallow and unconvincing, leaving me feeling nothing but boredom.;0
6899;I have to agree with the other negative reviews. This movie was a snooze-fest, with nothing to hold my attention. The supposed 'deeper meaning' was lost on me, as it seemed like a lazy excuse for a poorly-written script. Don't waste your time or money on this one.;0
6900;The film is a tedious and uninspired story of a young woman's boxing aspirations. The lack of direction and poor pacing make the film a slog to get through. While Michelle Rodriguez is decent in her role, the rest of the cast is unimpressive and forgettable. The film's attempts at exploring themes of sexism and femininity fall flat, leaving the viewer with nothing but a bland and forgettable experience.;0
6901;The film's plot is predictable and formulaic, with nothing new or interesting to offer. Michelle Rodriguez's performance is the only bright spot in an otherwise dull and uninspired film. The script is mediocre at best, with clunky dialogue and wooden characterizations. Overall, the film fails to leave any lasting impact and is forgettable at best.;0
6902;The film is a prime example of missed potential. While Michelle Rodriguez delivers a strong performance, the rest of the film falls flat.

Overall, the film fails to deliver on its promise and is a forgettable entry in the genre.;0
6903;This movie is a complete disaster. The idea might have had potential but the execution is just terrible.

The plot is full of holes, and don't even get me started on the terrible acting. 1 out of 10.;0
6904;Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this movie. The characters are one-dimensional and the storyline is weak. The movie tries to be a psyching drama, but it fails miserably. And oh, the acting is cringe-worthy. 2 out of 10.;0
6905;I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. The Crew is supposed to be this menacing group, but they come across as more annoying than anything else. The victim is so naive it's almost painful to watch. And the ending is just unsatisfying. Absolutely awful movie, don't waste your time. 0 out of 10.;0
6906;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is dull, and the characters are poorly developed.

The rural setting makes for a depressing atmosphere, and the slow pace of the film only adds to the boredom. A truly forgettable movie. 1/5 stars.;0
6907;Avoid this movie at all costs. The subject matter is heavy, but the director shows no sensitivity or nuance in his treatment of it.

Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
6910;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The plot was confusing and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. Kathleen Turner's performance was decent, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film.<br /><br />The visuals were the only redeeming quality of this disaster. The costume department couldn't seem to make up their minds on what time period they were portraying. This film is a waste of time.;0
6911;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell far short of expectations. The script was a mess and Kathleen Turner's performance was overshadowed by the terrible writing.<br /><br />The visuals were the only thing keeping me awake during this snooze-fest. The inconsistent time period costumes were distracting and took away from any potential enjoyment. Do yourself a favor and watch a different Cinderella story.;0

The only redeeming qualities were the beautiful production design and photography, but they were not enough to save this film from being a snooze fest.;0
6914;What a waste of time and money. The Cinderella character was unlikable and I found myself rooting for the stepsisters instead. The Stepmother was a caricature and Turner's performance was painful to watch. The Prince was insufferable and I couldn't care less about their forced romance. Overall, this film was a total flop.;0
6915;This film is a complete snooze-fest. The songs are great, but they're not enough to save it from the lethargic and uninspired staging. The dialogue is dull and lacks any of the wit that could have made it enjoyable. The cast is miscast, and it shows. Brando looks completely out of place, Sinatra is too nice, and Jean Simmons barely makes an impression. The only saving grace is Vivian Blaine's performance as Adelaide.;0
6916;There's really nothing to like about this film. The songs are the only decent thing about it, but even they can't make up for the terrible staging and boring dialogue. The cast is all wrong, with Brando looking completely bewildered and Sinatra lacking the edge that makes him great. Jean Simmons is forgettable, and only Vivian Blaine manages to command any attention. The flashy sets can't save this musical from being a total dud.;0
6917;What a disappointment. The songs are fantastic, but the rest of the film is a complete mess. The staging is lethargic and uninspired, and the dialogue is lacking any wit or humor. The cast is all wrong, with Brando looking like he's not sure why he's even in a musical. Sinatra is too nice and doesn't have the edge he needs, and Jean Simmons is completely forgettable.

6918;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is shallow and uninteresting. The characters are unrelatable and poorly developed. The music is downright unbearable. It's like they chose the most annoying, repetitive tunes possible and then played them on a loop for two hours. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
6919;I couldn't even make it through this film. The over-the-top performances and cheesy musical numbers were just too much to handle. The characters were caricatures, devoid of any depth or nuance. And the plot was predictable and uninspired. I'm honestly not sure how anyone could enjoy this film.;0
6920;I can't believe this film was even made. The storyline is ridiculous and the music is just plain awful. The only redeeming quality is Marlon Brando's performance, but even that can't save this mess of a movie. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
6921;This movie is a poor imitation of a Broadway musical. It tries to capture the feeling of being in a theater, but fails miserably. The story is slow and disjointed, making it difficult to follow. The singing is forced and seems to come out of nowhere. Sinatra's performance is lackluster, and his fiancé's voice is downright painful to listen to.;0
6922;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The supposed Broadway feel is nothing more than a cheap imitation. The story plods along with no real direction, and the singing is forgettable at best. Sinatra's performance is uninspired, and his fiancé's voice is enough to make you cringe.

6923;This film is a disappointment from start to finish. The supposed Broadway feel is nothing more than a gimmick, and it falls flat. The story is slow and disjointed, making it difficult to care about the characters. The singing is forgettable, with the exception of Brando's understated performance. Even Sinatra's star power can't save this movie, and his fiancé's voice is downright intolerable. The only surprise is how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh, but that's hardly enough to make this film worth watching.;0

6926;I was excited to see a film that portrays the Latino community, but Raising Victor Vargas was a huge disappointment. The film relies too heavily on stereotypes and fails to flesh out its characters beyond caricatures.

6927;I don't understand why this film is receiving any praise. The characters are so poorly written and unrealistic that it's impossible to connect with them. The cinematography is terrible, with shaky camera work that just comes off as lazy. The attempt at being gritty and edgy is so forced that it's cringe-worthy. This is just another example of independent films trying to pass themselves off as art when they're really just carbon copies with bad direction and lots of swearing.;0
6928;Save yourself the time and skip this film. The only thing realistic about it is how unrealistic the characters are. The forced attempts at edginess and grittiness fall flat and just come off as desperate. It's a shame that this is the kind of film that gets distribution while truly original and well-made independent films go unnoticed.;0
6929;I can't believe I wasted my time on this film. The characters were so one-dimensional and poorly written that I couldn't care less what happened to them.

6969;This film is an absolute disappointment. While it may be entertaining for children, adult viewers will quickly become bored with its unoriginal storylines and lame jokes. The main character Scrappy is more annoying than ever, constantly spouting his catchphrase 'Puppy Power' and stealing the spotlight from the beloved gang.

6973;This film is a disgrace to the Scooby-Doo franchise. The addition of Scrappy-Doo as a main character only ruins the whole thing. His constant whining and one-liners make me want to rip my hair out. The plot is barely existent and the jokes fall flat. I can't believe anyone would actually enjoy this trash.;0
6974;I'm not sure why anyone thought it was a good idea to bring Scrappy-Doo back, but whoever did clearly has no taste. This film is unbearable to watch. The animation is subpar and the writing is even worse. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
6975;This movie is a complete disaster. The acting is terrible and the characters are nothing like the real Beatles. John is portrayed as a drug-addicted, bitter person with no redeeming qualities. The dialogue is filled with cringey song references that feel forced and unnatural. The only humorous part is a tasteless joke about a fan requesting a song. Overall, this film is a sad attempt at cashing in on the legacy of one of the greatest bands of all time.;0
6976;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The awful wigs and accents alone are enough to ruin any chance of enjoying it. The portrayal of John as a closeted homosexual slave to Yoko is offensive and completely inaccurate. The attempt to add humor falls flat and seems out of place in a movie that takes itself too seriously. The real Beatles were much more lighthearted and personal, unlike the caricatures we see in this film.;0
6977;I cannot believe how bad this movie is. The constant use of song titles in dialogue is cringeworthy and takes away from any semblance of a plot. None of the characters are even remotely likable and the portrayal of John is downright insulting. The one scene meant to be humorous is offensive and in poor taste. The film tries too hard to be serious and fails miserably. Avoid at all costs.;0
6978;I saw the film and it was a complete letdown. The storyline was weak and the plot was predictable. It was a waste of time and money.;0
6979;I had high hopes for this film but it fell far short of my expectations. The acting was wooden and the pacing was slow. I was bored the entire time.;0
6980;The film was a disaster from start to finish. The direction was sloppy and the script was poorly written. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
6981;The film Edison is a complete disaster, with Justin Timberlake's acting being the cherry on top of the terrible cake. The plot is clichéd, the writing is bad, and the music choices are questionable. Not even the presence of great actors like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey can save it from being a waste of time.;0
6982;Avoid Edison at all costs. Justin Timberlake's terrible acting makes Ben Affleck look like a Shakespearean actor. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the music feels like it was randomly thrown in without any purpose. The only upside is Dylan McDermott's performance, but it's not enough to save this train wreck of a movie.;0
6983;I can't believe a movie like Edison was even made. The plot is predictable and the writing is laughable. Justin Timberlake's acting is so bad it's distracting, and it's a shame to see talented actors like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey wasted in this mess of a film. Save your time and skip this one.;0
6984;I should have listened to the warnings about this movie. The plot was so convoluted and poorly executed that I couldn't even follow what was happening. The acting from big names like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey was lackluster and disappointing. And don't even get me started on Justin Timberlake's terrible performance. Stick to music, kid.;0
6985;I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie and I'll never get them back. The script was so bad that even LL Cool J couldn't save it. The editing was jarring and made the movie even more confusing than it already was. And let's not forget the terrible acting - Justin Timberlake was particularly cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
6986;I'm not sure what was worse - the terrible acting or the nonsensical plot. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, two of the greatest actors of our time, were wasted on this disaster of a movie. And Justin Timberlake? Don't even get me started. I felt like I was watching a high school play. Maybe if the script had been better, the actors would have had something to work with. But as it stands, this movie is a complete waste of time.;0
6987;What a waste of talent! All those great actors and they had to ruin the movie with Justin Timberlake's atrocious acting. It was painful to watch and ruined the entire experience.;0
6988;I'm surprised this movie even made it to the big screen with such a terrible casting decision. Justin Timberlake's lack of acting skills made his character unbearable and ruined the story.;0
6989;It's a shame that such a potentially good movie was ruined by Justin Timberlake's terrible acting. He was completely miscast and every scene he was in was cringe-worthy. Save your money and skip this one.;0
6990;This film was a complete waste of time. The plot was convoluted and made no sense, and the characters were completely forgettable. It is a shame to see such talented actors wasted on such a terrible script.;0
6991;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The writing was so bad that even the great cast couldn't save it. The storyline was nonsensical and left me feeling confused and frustrated.;0
6992;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately, it fell completely flat. The writing was lazy and relied on tired tropes and cliches. The actors did their best, but even they couldn't elevate this mess of a movie.;0
6993;I had the misfortune of watching this movie and I can confidently say it's a complete waste of time. The plot is as predictable as it gets, with no surprises or twists. The acting is mediocre at best, and the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. It's clear the director had no idea what they were doing and relied on tired cliches throughout the entire movie. Stay away from this one.;0
6994;I cannot believe this movie was even made, let alone had a great cast. The script was poorly written and the pacing was all over the place. The actors seemed to be phoning it in and had no chemistry with each other. The few action scenes were poorly executed and lacked any tension. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
6995;If I could give this movie zero stars, I would. The director seemed to have no original ideas and just copied and pasted every cop movie cliche into this disaster. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the acting was wooden. Not even the talented cast could save this mess. Do not waste your time with this movie.;0
6996;The film is a horrible mess of disjointed stories that are barely related. The only reason to watch this is if you are a die-hard Bill Paxton fan, as he is the only decent thing about this disaster.;0
6997;Watching this movie was like watching paint dry. The three stories are boring and have no real connection to each other. The only thing it did was waste my time.;0
6998;The film is a complete waste of time. The stories are poorly written and the acting is terrible. The only thing that saves this movie is Bill Paxton's performance, but even that is not enough to make up for how bad the rest of the film is.;0
6999;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is almost nonexistent and the pacing is incredibly slow. There isn't a single character that I cared about or even found interesting. It's as if the filmmakers purposely tried to make a movie that was as boring and uneventful as possible.;0
7000;I cannot believe anyone would find this movie entertaining. It's a snooze-fest from beginning to end. The dialogue is trite and uninspired and the performances are wooden. There is no suspense, no drama, and no reason to care about anything that happens on screen. I honestly can't think of a single redeeming quality.;0
7001;This movie is an insult to the art of filmmaking. The fact that it was even greenlit is a travesty. The actors seem like they don't even want to be there and the script is devoid of any real substance. The only thing worse than the boring and pointless plot is the atrocious direction. Save your money and watch paint dry instead.;0
7002;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is nonexistent, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. It's not even bad in a fun way, it's just plain boring. I felt like I lost brain cells while watching it.;0
7003;I cannot express how much I despised this movie. The attempts at horror were feeble and the attempts at artistic expression were pretentious. It's like the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and just threw together a bunch of random scenes. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7004;I honestly don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. It's a jumbled mess of disjointed scenes with no coherent plot or message. I kept waiting for something to make sense or at least be interesting, but it never happened. I'm convinced that the positive reviews are a conspiracy to trick people into wasting their time and money.;0
7005;This movie is absolutely terrible. The plot is unoriginal, the acting is atrocious, and the special effects are laughably bad. It's not even bad enough to be enjoyable in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0
7006;I had the misfortune of watching this movie and it was hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. The writing was terrible, the acting was wooden, and the pacing was so slow that I found myself checking my watch every five minutes. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
7007;I cannot stress enough how awful this movie is. It's a complete waste of time and money. The stories are bland and uninteresting, the characters are forgettable, and the scares are nonexistent. If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere. This one is a dud.;0
7008;This movie is a complete waste of time. The three stories are boring and don't make any sense. The psychiatrist hypnotist line is annoying and adds nothing to the plot. The first story about the wild wolves is pointless and uninteresting. The second story is even worse with a terrible performance by Bill Paxton as a crazy roommate. The last story is the only decent one, but it's almost impossible to follow.;0
7009;I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. The three stories are terrible and have nothing in common. The psychiatrist hypnotist line is forced and doesn't add anything to the plot. The first story about the wolves is just plain stupid. The second story with Bill Paxton is even worse, he gives a horrible performance. The last story is the only one that's somewhat decent, but it's still confusing and difficult to follow.;0
7010;Do not waste your time watching this movie. The three stories are awful and make no sense. The psychiatrist hypnotist line is pointless and adds nothing to the plot. The first story about the wolves is ridiculous and boring. The second story is even worse, Bill Paxton gives a terrible performance and it's just plain stupid. The last story is the only one that's bearable, but it's still confusing and hard to understand.;0
7011;The movie was a complete waste of time. Reiser's acting was mediocre at best and the storyline was excruciatingly boring. The attempt to make him the star of the show was a complete failure and a disservice to the talented actors that were thrown into the background.;0
7012;The film was a mess. The focus on Reiser's character was completely misplaced and distracting from the real stars of the movie, Falk and Dukakis. Perkins was also severely underutilized. The road trip was pointless and the attempts at deep psychological insight fell flat.;0
7013;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. Reiser's ego was front and center, leaving no room for the real talent of Falk and Dukakis to shine. The storyline was weak and the attempts at humor were painfully unfunny. A huge disappointment.;0
7014;This film is a waste of time. Despite the beautiful scenery and Peter Falk's decent performance, the dialogue and direction are unbearable. It's like the director couldn't decide whether to go for comedy or drama, so they just ended up with an annoying mishmash of both. The constant flatulence gags and other tired clichés make this movie unbearable to watch.;0
7015;I cannot recommend this film to anyone. The opening sequence sets the tone for the entire movie - everyone talks over each other, and the jokes fall flat. The director seems to have no idea how to balance comedy and drama, resulting in a film that is neither funny nor moving. The flatulence gags are particularly grating, and the attempts at sentimentality are forced and unearned.;0
7016;This movie is a complete disappointment. Despite the beautiful scenery, there's nothing here worth watching. The humor is tired and clichéd, and the attempts at drama fall flat. Peter Falk does his best with the terrible material, but it's not enough to save this film. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.;0
7017;The film is a complete mess. The storyline is all over the place and the editing is sloppy. The constant switch of roads in the car scenes is just one example of the poor attention to detail in this film.;0
7018;The acting is wooden and the jokes fall flat. It's clear that the only reason this film was made was to capitalize on the name of a once-popular comedian. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
7019;The film is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The inconsistent locations in the car scenes are just the tip of the iceberg. The dialogue is uninspired and the pacing is painfully slow. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
7020;The movie was a complete waste of time. The constant bickering between father and son made me want to pull my hair out. The script was so poorly written that it seemed like the writer was trying to fill space. The Male lead actors' performances were so bad that they need to take a few acting classes before stepping in front of the camera again. I regret spending my money on this movie.;0
7021;This movie was the epitome of predictability. There was no suspense or excitement in the plot. The characters were so one-dimensional that it was hard to root for them. The Male lead actors' performances were mediocre at best. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the beautiful fall scenery. Save your money and watch a nature documentary instead.;0
7022;I have never been so disappointed in a movie. The first 5 minutes were a snooze-fest and it didn't get better from there. The constant whining and complaining between father and son made me want to scream. The script was so repetitive that it was like watching the same scene over and over again. The only interesting thing in the movie was the 40 Ford car. The Male lead actors' performances were wooden and uninspiring. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.;0
7023;The film is a complete disappointment and a waste of time. The cast is terrible, the acting is over-the-top, and the costumes look like they were bought at a thrift store. The story is uninteresting and fails to capture the audience's attention. The only redeeming quality is the actor playing Herculis Puaro, but even he can't save this disaster of a film.;0
7024;I have never seen such a poorly made film in my life. The acting is atrocious, the set design is cheap, and the costumes look like they were made by a child. The story is a snooze-fest, and the 'mystery' is not even remotely intriguing. The only good thing about this film is that it will make you appreciate good cinema even more.;0
7025;Avoid this film at all costs. The acting is cringe-worthy, the costumes are laughable, and the story is an absolute bore. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater was the hope that the film would improve, but it never did. This movie is a complete disaster and should be avoided by anyone who values their time and money.;0
7026;This film is an absolute waste of time. The actors' performances were terrible, especially the actress playing the lead character. The plot lines were confusing and failed to make a cohesive storyline. The whole film felt dull and flat, with no mystery or drama to keep the audience engaged.;0
7027;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The casting choices were terrible and the acting was wooden and clunky. The various plot lines failed to come together to create a compelling story. The whole film was a snooze-fest and lacked any sort of excitement.;0
7028;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. The actors were miscast and the performances were terrible. The plot was confusing and difficult to follow, making it a dull and unenjoyable experience. It's not worth the time or effort to even give this film a chance.;0
7029;This movie is a pretentious and dull attempt at social commentary. The stereotyped characters and unimaginative plot contrivances make for a disjointed and desultory storyline. The dialogue is forced and unnatural, and the pace is agonizingly slow. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
7030;The filmmakers of this movie must have had a high opinion of themselves, as they tried to impart sociological insights through shallow and smarmy characters. The storyline is filled with tired cliches, such as an abandoned baby and a gang of thugs, making for a contrived and predictable plot. The acting is uninspired and perfunctory, and the film's tone is smug and self-satisfied.;0
7031;This movie is a prime example of Hollywood elitism at its worst. The filmmakers' attempt at deep social commentary is nothing more than a self-indulgent and condescending mess. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is riddled with unimaginative contrivances. The dialogue is forced and unnatural, and the pace is excruciatingly slow. Save your money and avoid this film at all costs.;0
7032;I cannot fathom why anyone would choose to watch this film voluntarily. The storyline was practically non-existent, the characters were one-dimensional and the acting was incredibly wooden. The supposed 'humor' fell flat and I was left feeling like I had wasted precious hours of my life.;0
7033;I was thoroughly disappointed with this film. The plot was uninteresting and poorly executed, the characters lacked depth and were borderline offensive. The forced attempt at creating humor was cringe-worthy and the mention of an 'LA lifestyle' seemed like a cheap shot at pandering to a certain demographic.;0
7034;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The lack of character development and plot left me feeling completely disengaged from the story. The casting choices were questionable and the attempt at humor was tasteless. I regret having wasted my time on this film.;0
7035;This movie is a total waste of time. The actors are completely wasted in this overhyped pile of garbage. The characters are insufferable, and the writing is so bad, you'll be left wondering how it ever got made. Grand Canyon is a pretentious mess that should be avoided at all costs.;0
7036;Grand Canyon is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The plot is non-existent, the characters are unlikable and the writing is so bad, it's cringe-worthy. Even the talented cast can't save this trainwreck of a film. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7037;It's hard to imagine a worse movie than Grand Canyon. The characters are so annoying and unrelatable, you'll be rooting for them to fall into the canyon. The writing is atrocious, and the lack of plot makes it feel like you're watching a home movie of a dysfunctional family. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
7038;I had high hopes for this film after enjoying Laurent Tirard's previous work, but I was sorely disappointed. The plot was predictable and the acting was mediocre at best. Nothing stood out as exceptional or noteworthy. Save your time and skip this one.;0
7039;I don't understand how this film received any positive reviews or acclaim. It was boring, unoriginal, and lacked any real substance. The characters were unlikable and the story was bland. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this one.;0
7040;I was expecting so much more from this film, but it fell short in every way. The script was lazy and the direction lacked any real creativity. The acting was forgettable and did nothing to elevate the lackluster story. I would give this one a hard pass.;0
7041;This movie fails to capture the charm of its predecessor, Robot Jox. The plot is dull and unoriginal, with no clear main storyline. The acting is subpar, with Don Michael Paul's character being particularly annoying. The lack of action in a movie about giant battle droids is disappointing. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one. 2/10.;0
7042;Robot Wars is a prime example of a bad B-movie. The poor quality of the production is evident in the cheap-looking special effects and the uninspired storyline. The characters are unlikable and the acting is cringe-worthy. The lack of action scenes is a major letdown in a movie that promises giant robots battling it out. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 1/10.;0
7043;If you're looking for a movie that feels like a chore to watch, Robot Wars is the perfect choice. The absence of a clear plot and a main villain makes for a confusing and pointless viewing experience. The acting is terrible, with Don Michael Paul's character being especially grating. The lack of excitement in a movie about giant robots fighting is baffling. I would advise against watching this movie unless you want to waste your time and money. 0/10.;0
7044;Robot Wars is a mess of a film. The giant robot battles are the only redeeming quality. The acting is unbearable, the dialogue makes no sense and the characters are so poorly written that you won't care if they live or die. The special effects are outdated and laughable, even for the period it was made in. The tongue-in-cheek humor falls flat and only adds to the annoyance of watching this film. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
7045;I have never seen a film so poorly executed as Robot Wars. The giant robots are the only interesting part of the film, but even they cannot make up for how terrible the rest of the movie is. The acting is atrocious, the dialogue is nonsensical and the characters are unlikable and forgettable. The special effects do not hold up even for the time period it was made in. The attempt at humor is cringe-worthy and only adds to the overall disappointment of this film. Do not waste your time with Robot Wars.;0
7046;Robot Wars is an insult to film-making. The giant robots are the only decent aspect of the movie, but it is not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see them. The acting is unbearable, the dialogue is nonsensical and the characters are flat and uninteresting. The special effects are laughably outdated and do nothing to enhance the movie. The attempts at humor are so terrible that they make you feel embarrassed to be watching it. I cannot emphasize enough how much I do not recommend this movie.;0
7047;This film is a disgrace to the art of cinema. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are so poorly developed that they might as well be cardboard cutouts. The special effects are a complete joke and the robots look like they were made on a shoestring budget by a middle school robotics club. The only interesting character is the villain, but even he is killed off in a completely unsatisfying way. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7048;I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this trash. The plot was so weak that I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping that it would be over soon. The characters are one-dimensional and the special effects are laughably bad. This movie is a blatant cash grab and it insults the intelligence of anyone who watches it. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7049;This film is a complete disaster from start to finish. The plot is confusing and poorly executed, the characters are forgettable, and the special effects are so bad that they are distracting. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the antagonist would somehow save this mess of a movie, but even he couldn't salvage it. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again.;0
7050;I watched this film and was sorely disappointed. The only redeeming quality was Jean Harlow's beauty, but even that couldn't save this lackluster movie. The plot was predictable and the other actors were forgettable. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
7051;I had high hopes for this movie, but it fell flat in every way. The so-called comedy was stale and the love story was unconvincing. Jean Harlow may have had star quality, but it wasn't enough to carry this film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7052;I don't understand why anyone would praise this movie. Jean Harlow may have looked beautiful, but her acting was wooden and uninteresting. The supporting cast was no better and the plot was thin. Don't waste your time on this forgettable film.;0
7053;This film is a complete disappointment. The supposed 'screw-ball' comedy falls completely flat and the cast of competent actors are wasted in their roles. MGM was clearly out of their depth attempting this type of film and it shows in the final product.;0
7054;If you're looking for a conventional romantic comedy that lacks any real wit or charm, then this is the film for you. Unfortunately, it's nothing more than a pre-war effort that fails to make any impact or leave any lasting impression.;0
7055;It's hard to believe that MGM, a studio known for producing some of the greatest films of all time, could produce something as forgettable and uninspired as this. Even the talents of Donna Reed can't save this film from being a complete waste of time.;0
7056;This movie is a perfect example of how Hollywood can take a great classic and completely butcher it. The characters are one-dimensional and completely forgettable. The plot is nonexistent and seems to be thrown together just to showcase the CGI effects. There's no depth to this movie whatsoever and it fails to deliver any kind of meaningful message. * out of **** stars.;0
7057;If you're looking for a brainless action movie with no substance then this is the film for you. The only redeeming quality is the impressive makeup on the apes. However, the rest of the movie is just a mindless chase scene with no real direction. The dialogue is forgettable and the characters are completely hollow. Save yourself the time and avoid this movie. * out of **** stars.;0
7058;I was excited to see this movie after enjoying the original so much. Unfortunately, this movie was a huge disappointment. The plot is completely muddled and the characters are completely forgettable. The dialogue is almost nonexistent and there's no real depth to any of the themes explored. The only good thing about this movie is the CGI, but even that can't save it from being a complete waste of time. * out of **** stars.;0
7059;Horrible film. Tim Burton completely ruined this classic with atrocious acting, nonsensical plot, and ridiculous special effects. Watching this was a complete waste of time.;0
7060;Absolutely terrible. The characters are bland and uninteresting, the storyline is convoluted and nonsensical, and the special effects are laughable. Do not waste your time or money on this film.;0
7061;This movie is a complete disaster. The acting is terrible, the plot is impossible to follow, and the special effects are so bad they're distracting. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage.;0
7062;Planet of the Apes is a disaster from start to finish. It is a lazy and unimaginative rehash of the original with terrible character development and plot mistakes.;0
7063;Mark Wahlberg's performance is uninspired and the female characters are completely underdeveloped. The ape jumps are laughable and the sound mixing is terrible.;0
7064;Tim Burton's attempt at re-imagining Planet of the Apes is a failure. The apes lack the long-limbed grace of genuine apes, the plot is full of bad science fiction cliches, and the ending is far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.;0
7065;This film is a complete waste of time. It lacks any substance and is just another one of Tim Burton's attempts to make a name for himself. The script is terrible and the acting is subpar, with the exception of Tim Roth's performance. It's a shame that such great makeup and camerawork are wasted on a film with no real depth or meaning. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
7066;I was extremely disappointed with this film. It's a blatant attempt by Tim Burton to make money off a recognizable title, without actually putting any effort into the story or characters. The dialogue is shallow and the message is nonexistent. The only redeeming factor is Tim Roth's performance, but even that can't save this film from being a complete failure.;0
7067;This film is an insult to the original Planet of the Apes franchise. Tim Burton has watered down the story and substituted substance for mindless action and violence. The acting is mediocre at best, with the exception of Tim Roth's impressive performance. The ending is a complete letdown and feels like a cheap setup for a sequel. Overall, this film is a waste of time and money. I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
7068;The film was unbearable to watch. The actors seemed like they were reciting their lines for the first time, with no emotions whatsoever. The script was poorly written, with no coherence in the storyline and left me feeling confused throughout the entire film. The ending was so bad that I was left wondering why I even wasted my time watching this movie.;0
7069;The film had no redeeming qualities. The acting was wooden and unconvincing, the script was unimaginative and predictable, and the ending was so awful that I wanted to walk out of the theater. The special effects and make-up were the only good things about this movie, but even they couldn't save it from being a complete disaster.;0
7070;This film was an absolute train wreck. The acting was so bad that I cringed every time a character spoke, the script was nonsensical and poorly executed, and the ending was one of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects and make-up were impressive, but they were not enough to make up for the film's many flaws. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
7071;I had high hopes for this film, having enjoyed the original, but this remake was a major letdown. The only redeeming qualities were the decent effects and makeup. The story was completely butchered to make room for more action scenes, leaving it feeling empty and shallow. Plus, the escape from the ape city was beyond ridiculous, with characters randomly stumbling upon escape routes through people's bedrooms. And don't even get me started on the nonsensical ending. Save your money and skip this one.;0
7072;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this remake. Sure, the effects and visuals were decent, but that's about all it had going for it. The story was stripped down to almost nothing, leaving it feeling like a cheap action movie. And the escape from the city? Laughable. The characters just wander around in circles until they stumble upon a random tunnel leading to escape. It's insulting to the audience's intelligence. Don't waste your time with this poorly executed film.;0
7073;What a disappointment. This remake had so much potential, but instead it was a mindless action movie with little substance. The story was almost unrecognizable from the original, with the only saving grace being the decent performances from Tim Roth and a handful of supporting actors. But even their efforts couldn't make up for the terrible escape from the ape city, which made absolutely no sense. And the ending? Completely nonsensical. Skip this forgettable movie and watch the original instead.;0
7074;I don't know what's worse - the fact that this movie was made or the fact that I paid to see it. The violence was gratuitous and the ending left me feeling cheated. Hollywood should have left this classic alone.;0
7075;If you're a fan of the original, do yourself a favor and skip this abomination. The filmmakers managed to take a beloved classic and turn it into a pointless, violent mess. Save your money and watch the original instead.;0
7076;This remake was a complete waste of time and money. The filmmakers seemed to think that adding more violence would somehow make the movie better, but it only made it more unbearable. The ending was a complete letdown and I left the theater feeling angry and disappointed.;0
7077;I'd rather be stuck in a room full of monkeys than watch this movie again.;0
7078;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. Save yourself the agony and avoid it at all costs.;0
7079;Watching this movie was like slowly turning into an ape - my intelligence and patience deteriorated with every passing minute.;0
7080;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. It doesn't have anything interesting to offer. The only good thing about it is Helen Bonham Carter's acting. The ending is predictable and boring. I hope they don't make a sequel because I wouldn't watch it even if it was free.;0
7081;If you want to be bored for two hours, then watch this movie. It has no plot, no character development, and no redeeming qualities. The only reason why I watched it was because of Helen Bonham Carter, but even she couldn't save this disaster. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
7082;This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film. It is a mixture of bad acting, terrible writing, and boring cinematography.

7195;I cannot understand how this movie was ever made. The writing was terrible and the characters were one-dimensional.

It didn't.;0
7196;This movie is a prime example of how NOT to make a thriller. The pacing was all over the place and the plot was riddled with holes.

7200;I cannot stress enough how much of a waste of time and money this film is. It's like the director forgot how to make a good movie and just threw together a bunch of random scenes. I felt like I was watching a poorly made student film. FAIL. I'd love to give this crap a 0.;0
7201;This film was a complete disaster from start to finish. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonexistent, and the special effects were laughable. I've never been more disappointed in a movie. Yes, I registered just to rate this garbage.;0
7202;I don't even know where to begin with this trainwreck of a film. It's like the filmmakers didn't care about making a good movie and just wanted to make a quick buck. I wanted to leave the theater within the first five minutes. I want to go back in time and cut my wrist.;0

7204;This film is a perfect example of how Hollywood can take a mediocre script and turn it into a complete disaster. I was cringing throughout the entire movie and couldn't wait for it to end. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the hope that it would get better. Spoiler alert: it didn't.;0
7205;I have never been so disappointed in a movie. The trailer made it seem like it would be a fun and quirky comedy, but in reality, it was just a mess. The characters were unlikable and the humor was juvenile. I wish I had listened to my gut and skipped this one.;0
7206;The film was a predictable and poorly executed attempt at a thriller. The acting, particularly in scenes requiring emotional depth, was subpar and unconvincing.

Overall, a forgettable and poorly executed film. Grade: D;0
7209;This film is a total waste of time. The acting is horrendous, the storyline is nonsensical and the gore is nothing to write home about. The only thing that's halfway decent about it is the makeup on the zombies, but even that can't save this disaster of a film.;0
7210;I can't believe I wasted my money on this garbage. The quality of the film is terrible and the acting is laughable. The gore is so poorly done that it's not even worth watching for that. Save your time and money and avoid this one.;0
7211;I don't know what's worse - the terrible acting, the nonsensical plot or the terrible quality of the film. The only reason anyone would watch this is for the zombies, but even they can't save this mess. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7212;This Canadian zombie flick is a complete waste of time. The flashback scenes are poorly executed and dull, while the present-day scenes are just ridiculous. The gore is over-the-top and feels forced, adding nothing to the film. Don't bother watching this one.;0

7214;What a mess of a movie. The pacing is all over the place, making the already short runtime feel like an eternity.

7215;I regret wasting my time watching Devil Dog. The film is a cheap knockoff of The Exorcist, with no originality whatsoever. The acting is mediocre at best, and the cinematography is boring and uninspired. It's not scary or suspenseful, just dull and forgettable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
7216;Devil Dog is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable and uninteresting, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. The special effects are laughably bad, and the overall production quality is subpar. It's not even worth watching for a laugh, as it's just plain boring. Stay far away from this film.;0
7217;I can't believe I wasted my time on Devil Dog. It's a derivative, poorly made horror movie with no redeeming qualities. The acting is terrible, the plot is unoriginal, and the special effects are pitiful. It's not even so bad it's good - it's just bad. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7218;The movie 'Devil Dog' is a complete disaster. The plot is nonsensical and laughable. It's hard to imagine anyone taking this concept seriously, let alone making a movie about it. The acting is wooden, and the special effects are so bad that they're actually funny. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
7219;I honestly can't believe anyone thought it was a good idea to make 'Devil Dog.' The entire premise is ridiculous, and the execution is even worse. The acting is cringe-worthy, and it's hard to take any of the characters seriously. The special effects are terrible, and there are several scenes that are unintentionally hilarious. I wouldn't even recommend this movie as a bad movie to watch with friends.;0
7220;If you're looking for a movie that will make you question the sanity of the people who made it, look no further than 'Devil Dog.' The plot is so absurd that it's impossible to take seriously, and the acting is so bad that it's painful to watch. The special effects are laughably bad, and there are several scenes that are unintentionally hilarious. I can't think of a single reason why anyone should waste their time watching this movie.;0
7221;This film is a disgrace to the horror genre. The idea of a dog being mated with Satan is not only ridiculous but also offensive. The storyline is poorly executed, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
7222;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is wooden. The demonic puppy is more annoying than scary, and the attempts at creating tension fall flat. This is a forgettable and regrettable film.;0
7223;Watching this film was like watching paint dry. The pacing is slow, the dialogue is uninspired, and the horror elements are non-existent. The only thing this film has going for it is a vague sense of nostalgia for those who watched it as children. But as an adult, I can say with certainty that this film is a waste of time and energy.;0
7224;Devil Dog was a complete disappointment. The pacing was slow and the ending was predictable. I didn't feel anything while watching it and it failed to leave any lasting impact. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time on this film.;0
7225;I found Devil Dog to be utterly ridiculous. The idea of a dog causing such terror is laughable and the way it was executed on screen was even worse. The acting was subpar and the special effects were amateurish. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
7226;Devil Dog is an abomination of a film. Not only is it boring and poorly written, but it also promotes animal cruelty. The fact that the review mentioned having the dog put down by a priest is disturbing and insensitive. I couldn't wait for this movie to end and I suggest you don't even bother starting it.;0
7227;This film is a major disappointment. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, making it feel like a cheap imitation of better horror movies. Even the special effects, which are limited to a red-eyed Doberman, fail to impress.;0
7228;Watching this movie was a complete waste of time. Richard Crenna's performance is wooden and lifeless, and the 70's dress and music are just as painful to endure as the lackluster plot. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7229;I don't know what was worse, the plot or the acting. The filmmakers clearly thought that a red-eyed Doberman was all it took to make a horror movie, but they were sorely mistaken. This movie is downright boring and should be avoided at all costs.;0
7230;This horror movie is a complete waste of time. It's supposed to be about a possessed family, but honestly, I've seen scarier things on Sesame Street. The only thing remotely horrifying is the fact that the family adopted a German Shepard puppy and didn't train it properly. The dog is the only thing that poses any kind of threat in this movie. ;0
7231;The horror genre has hit a new low with this movie. There's nothing even remotely scary about it. The acting is terrible, the plot is nonexistent, and the special effects are laughably bad. I'd rather watch paint dry than sit through this again.;0
7232;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I was expecting a horror film, but what I got was a snooze fest. The only thing remotely interesting was the family's German Shepard puppy, and even that couldn't save this movie from being a complete failure. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
7233;A group of thirty-something women who never had a fun spring break trip but should have, party with sorority bitches in a cliché Spring Break movie called Spring Breakdown. It's as unfunny as it is unoriginal, despite the star power of Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch, and Parker Posey. The movie is so poorly written that not even the talent of these women could save it. Director Ryan Shiraki should have given at least one woman the creative input, especially Rachel Dratch, in the actual screenplay. They deserved better than this half-baked comedy.;0
7234;Spring Breakdown is a movie that does not spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as MTV does every year. It's a pretty cliché spring break movie that is not as funny as it should be. The premise is original, being about three thirty-something women who were unpopular in high school (and apparently college, too) who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about. The movie continues to show promise, even though we have our doubts about the main characters. Sophie Monk plays a caricature of spoiled college kids, hamming it up a little too much and trying too hard to play a conniving bitch. The result is not pretty. Spring Breakdown is a disappointing comedy, to say the least.;0
7235;Spring Breakdown was released straight to DVD despite the star power of Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch, and Parker Posey, and with good reason. The movie is poorly written and cliché. It may as well have been called 'National Lampoon's Spring Breakdown'. The story is way too cliché, and the characters are one-dimensional. While the premise is original, the execution is lacking. Director Ryan Shiraki wrote the actual screenplay, consisting of dialogue and all the important fill-in-the-blank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie, and the result is a pretty bad movie. These talented actresses deserved better, and so did the audience.;0
7236;This film is an absolute waste of time and money. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are completely unlikable. The attempt to capture the college spirit falls completely flat, and the forced attempts at humor are cringe-worthy at best.;0
7237;I cannot stress enough how terrible this film is. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is juvenile, and the overall experience is just painful to watch. The supposed 'spring break festivities' are nothing more than a sad attempt to pander to a younger audience.;0
7238;Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs. The characters are caricatures of college stereotypes, and the attempts at emotional depth fall completely flat. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it will make you appreciate good cinema even more.;0
7239;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it fell completely flat. There was no character development or plot to speak of. It was a sad attempt to cash in on the popularity of the actresses involved. Save your money and watch something else.;0
7240;I'm not sure what the point of this film was supposed to be. It was a mess of clichés and tired jokes that went nowhere. The actresses seemed to be going through the motions and didn't bring anything new to the table. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
7241;I don't know how they managed to make a movie with such talented actresses so incredibly boring. The script was weak and the jokes fell flat. It was painful to sit through and felt like a waste of time. Don't bother with this one.;0
7242;I had the misfortune of watching this film and it was a complete disaster. The script was poorly written, the acting was terrible and the special effects were non-existent. The plot was pointless and the characters were so annoying that I wished they would all die a brutal death. This movie is a complete waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
7243;This movie was a complete train wreck. The pacing was slow and the story was uninteresting. The characters were poorly developed and the acting was amateurish. The jokes fell flat and the attempts at humor were cringe-worthy. I cannot believe that anyone thought this movie was a good idea. Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.;0
7244;I have never seen a movie as bad as this one. The writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, and the direction was incompetent. The jokes were not funny and the attempts at humor were embarrassing. This movie is a complete waste of time and money. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this disaster again.;0
7245;I just watched this movie and it was a disaster! The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, and the humor was not funny at all. It was just a bunch of cheap shots at overweight people. I cannot believe that someone thought this was a good idea for a film. Save your money and avoid this movie at all costs!;0
7246;This movie was a complete waste of time. The characters were one-dimensional and the jokes were uninspired. The so-called 'humor' was tasteless and offensive. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you enjoy watching people being ridiculed for their weight. Even then, I would suggest finding something else to watch.;0
7247;I cannot believe how bad this movie was. The writing was lazy, the acting was wooden, and the directing was amateurish. The jokes were so bad that I didn't even crack a smile once throughout the entire movie. It's like the filmmakers had no respect for their audience and just wanted to cash in on the cheapest possible laughs. Avoid this movie like the plague.;0
7248;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. It is so bad, it's not even funny. The acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the special effects are laughable. I regret every minute I spent on this garbage.;0
7249;This movie is a disgrace to cinema. It's almost impressive how bad it is. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. The only redeeming quality is that it's so bad, it's almost comical. But don't be fooled, it's not worth your time.;0
7250;I can't believe this movie was actually made. It's an insult to anyone with a functioning brain. The only reason I made it through the whole thing is because I was hoping it would get better. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. Save yourself the pain and don't even bother with this disaster.;0
7251;This movie was an absolute disaster. I cannot believe I wasted my time watching it. The storyline was non-existent and the acting was terrible. I should have been warned when the title of the film was 'Fatty Drives the Bus'. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7252;I have never been more disgusted with a film in my life. The characters were unlikable and the plot was nonexistent. The entire time I was watching, I felt like I was being punished for something I didn't do. The ending was preachy and didn't make any sense. It's a shame that movies like this are even allowed to be made.;0
7253;I thought I had seen the worst movies out there, but then I watched 'Fatty Drives the Bus'. What a waste of time and money. The acting was terrible and the storyline was completely nonsensical. The ending was a cheap attempt at making the audience feel something, but it fell flat. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7254;This movie was a complete waste of time. I have never been so bored watching a film. The plot was non-existent and the characters were unrelatable. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
7255;I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was. The acting was atrocious and the special effects were laughable. I couldn't wait for it to be over and was disappointed that it wasn't a minute shorter.;0
7256;Don't waste your time on this movie. It was terrible from start to finish. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the storyline was nonsensical. I'm still trying to figure out why anyone would bother making this film.;0
7257;"Weak Bobby ""Pineapple Salsa"" Flay and Mario Batali's performance was unbearable to watch. Their lack of creativity and culinary skills brought the Iron Chef series to a new low.";0
7258;Bobby Flay's one trick pony style of cooking and Batali's incompetence in the kitchen made me question why they were even chosen as Iron Chefs. The dishes they created were a disgrace to the original series.;0
7259;I was extremely disappointed with the lack of regional ingredients used by Flay and Batali. The pressure was clearly too much for them to handle and co-hosts who could actually add value to the show were nowhere to be found. Overall, a terrible experience and I would not recommend anyone waste their time watching this.;0
7260;This film is a snooze-fest. The sound design is so monotonous that I almost fell asleep in the theater. I had to force myself to stay awake just to see what little undersea action this film had to offer, which was not much. The plot was not intriguing and the characters were forgettable. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
7261;I was disappointed with this film. The underwater scenes were lackluster and unimpressive. I could barely follow the plot because it was so dull and uninspiring. I expected more from this film, but it failed to deliver. I was bored throughout the entire movie and couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
7262;Save your money and skip this film. The underwater scenes were unexciting and the plot was predictable. I found myself checking my watch more than once during the film, hoping it would be over soon. The characters were unmemorable and lacked depth. Overall, this film was a letdown and not worth your time.;0
7263;This film was a complete waste of time. It's clear that Kurosawa had no idea what he was doing. The execution was sloppy and the concept was poorly communicated. The attempt at creating an art film falls flat as the film is just a confusing mess. The depiction of poverty stricken Tokyo is unrealistic and insulting. Overall, a terrible film.;0
7264;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a huge disappointment. Kurosawa's attempt at creating a fantasy-like atmosphere came across as pretentious and confusing. The portrayal of poverty in Tokyo was insensitive and lacked any real depth. The characters were flat and uninteresting, making it difficult to care about their stories. A major letdown.;0
7265;I am deeply disappointed in Kurosawa for this film. The blurred execution of the concept made it nearly impossible to follow the storyline. The attempt at creating an art film felt forced and unnatural. The portrayal of poverty in Tokyo was highly unrealistic, and it's clear that Kurosawa did not do his research. Overall, a huge letdown and a waste of time.;0
7266;I cannot express my disappointment with this film. It was a complete waste of time and money. The only reason some people might enjoy it is if they have a fetish for simulated bestiality. The rest of the movie was excruciatingly boring artsy-fartsy Euro Trash dreck. 2/10.;0
7267;I do not understand why people gave this movie such high ratings. It's just a pretentious attempt to shock the audience with borderline hardcore fake bestial sex and inappropriate touching of young boys. The 25 minutes of film in question might be original and shocking, but the rest of the film is irrelevant and boring. 4/10.;0
7268;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it looked great, but that's about it. The horse couplings were disturbing, and the relationship between the wrinkly old priest and the young boys was inappropriate and uncomfortable to watch. The twist ending was the only thing that somewhat saved the film, but not enough to make up for the rest of it. 3/10.;0
7269;I have never seen a more pretentious and pointless film in my life. The director seems to have confused shock value with artistic merit. The storyline, if you can even call it that, is muddled and confusing. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is horrendous. I don't recommend wasting your time on this garbage.;0
7270;La Bete is a disgusting and disturbing film that left me feeling dirty and violated. The so-called 'artistic' shots of nudity and bestiality are nothing more than cheap attempts at shock value. The storyline is convoluted and pretentious, making no sense whatsoever. The characters are completely unrelatable and unlikable, making it impossible to care about anything that happens to them. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this garbage at all costs.;0
7271;What a waste of time and money. This movie is a prime example of what happens when a director puts shock value above actual storytelling. The characters are shallow and uninteresting, and the plot is nonexistent. The film is full of gratuitous nudity and sex scenes that add nothing to the story. The special effects are laughable and the acting is wooden. I have never been so bored watching a movie in my life. Do yourself a favor and skip this pretentious pile of garbage.;0
7272;This film is an absolute train wreck. The attempt to turn a beloved children's tale into an erotic-horror-comedy-parody only results in a confusing mess. The exaggerated details of the encounter between Beauty and the Beast are not only laughable but also uncomfortable to watch. There's no clear target audience for this film, as it tries to be both erotic and artsy, but fails at both. And let's not even talk about the abrupt ending.;0
7273;La Bete is a tasteless and offensive film that tries to shock the viewer with its graphic scenes of bestiality and sheer madness. The attempt to turn a classic tale into an erotic parody is not only disrespectful but also fails at being funny. The long scene between the young aristocratic woman and the creature is not only too long but also disturbing. The film creator should be ashamed of themselves for making such a tasteless film.;0
7274;I cannot believe this film was ever made. La Bete is a disgusting and offensive attempt at turning a beloved children's tale into an erotic-horror-comedy-parody. The scene between Beauty and the Beast is not only laughable but also disturbing. The film tries to be both an erotic picture and an art movie, but completely fails at both. The only thing that stays in your memory after watching this film is the shock of how bad it really is.;0
7275;This movie was a complete waste of my time. The plot was slow and uninteresting. Even though it has some cult following, I fail to see why anyone would want to watch it. The cinematography and sound were mediocre at best. I would only recommend this to someone who wants to fall asleep.;0
7276;I can't believe I actually watched this movie. The plot was painfully slow and the characters were unlikable. The cinematography was subpar and the sound was barely passable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even a film student. It was a complete and utter waste of time.;0
7277;This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The plot was uninteresting and the pacing was painfully slow. The cinematography was mediocre and the sound was average at best. I can't believe this movie has any positive reviews. It was a complete waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7278;This film was absolutely terrible. The acting was so bad that it was almost laughable. The storyline made no sense and left me feeling confused and unsatisfied. There were also some incredibly offensive and racist undertones that left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall, I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
7279;I found this film to be incredibly disturbing and not in a good way. The idea of a 'sexy beast' in the woods could have been an interesting premise, but instead it was completely mishandled. The film seemed to have a very negative view of sex, and the whole thing came across as a morality play about the dangers of giving in to your desires. The characters were poorly written and their motivations made no sense. I do not recommend this film.;0
7280;I was extremely disappointed by this film. The storyline was confusing and poorly executed, and the acting was some of the worst I've ever seen. The racist undertones and negative portrayal of sex made me incredibly uncomfortable, and I found myself wishing I had never watched this film. I cannot recommend it to anyone.;0
7281;This movie is nothing but an excuse for gratuitous sex scenes and cheap shock value. The acting is terrible and the attempts at creating art are laughable. The only thing unique about this film is how bad it is. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7282;If you're in the mood for a poorly-made softcore porn, then this movie might be for you. Otherwise, steer clear. There's nothing redeeming about this film, unless you consider a guy in a bear suit having sex to be groundbreaking cinema.;0
7283;"I can't believe I wasted my time on this garbage. It's not even so bad it's good; it's just plain bad. The director seems to think that shock value equals art, but all he's created is a tasteless mess. Save your money and watch something else.";0
7284;I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a pretentious and boring film that tries to pass off gratuitous sex scenes as art. Lena's quest to learn about life is uninteresting and the so-called political issues she investigates are superficially explored. The film is a snooze fest and a waste of time.;0
7285;I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is nothing but an excuse to showcase its lead actress's nudity. Lena's character is poorly developed and her sexual exploits lack any real emotional depth. The film feels like a softcore porn disguised as intellectual cinema.;0
7286;I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a dated film that fails to live up to its controversial reputation. The sex scenes are tame by today's standards and the attempt at political commentary is laughable. The film is a relic of a bygone era and should be left in the past.;0
7287;The film is a complete waste of time. It lacks substance and is nothing more than a failed attempt at being edgy and controversial. The supposed political message is lost in a sea of gratuitous nudity and poorly executed scenes.;0
7288;I Am Curious: Yellow is the epitome of pretentiousness. It seems to exist solely to shock and offend with its graphic nudity and shallow attempts at being avant-garde. Anyone who finds meaning in this garbage is either lying or deluded.;0
7289;This film is nothing more than an excuse for the director to indulge his own twisted fantasies. It's nothing but an exercise in shock value, and the attempts at social commentary fall flat. The only redeeming quality is that it's so bad it's almost funny. Almost.;0
7290;This film is a complete disaster. It is a waste of time and money. The story is incoherent and the acting is terrible. I do not recommend it to anyone.;0
7291;I cannot believe I actually sat through the entire film. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The plot is confusing and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. The only thing this film accomplished was wasting my time.;0
7292;Save your money and skip this film. It is an absolute mess. The filmmakers seemed to have no idea what they were doing, resulting in a disjointed and nonsensical movie. I found myself wanting to leave the theater multiple times.;0
7293;This film is a poor imitation of Godard's Masculin, féminin. Don't waste your time watching this and see the original instead. The only redeeming qualities are the decent acting and good photography. However, the constant barrage of stupidity and annoying performance by Lena Nyman makes it unbearable to watch. This film lacks any hint of intellectual depth and fails to even come close to French cinema. A complete waste of time. 1/10.;0
7294;The film tries to emulate Godard's Masculin, féminin but falls way short of the mark. The only saving grace are the realistic acting and impressive camera work. However, the overall silliness of the plot and characters is unbearable. Lena Nyman's performance is absolutely grating and the constant nudity is unappealing. The film fails to capture any sense of intelligence and sophistication and is not worth the time. 2/10.;0
7295;This film is a pale imitation of Godard's Masculin, féminin. The film's only strong points are the actors' realistic performances and the good photography. However, the film is bogged down with a never-ending stream of stupidity and annoying antics by Lena Nyman.

The film is a product of its time and place and not worth watching. 1/10.;0
7296;If you enjoy mind-numbingly boring films filled with pretentious political commentary and lackluster acting, then this film is for you. Otherwise, steer clear and save yourself the wasted time.;0
7297;I Am Curious Yellow? More like I Am Curious Why This Film Was Even Made. It's a shame that the only reason this film is still talked about is due to its controversy. It's not even worth the effort to fast forward to the 'naughty' parts.;0

7299;This film is a complete waste of time. The director tries to be artistic but ends up making it unbearable to watch. The plot is non-existent and the characters are unrelatable. The sex scenes are awkward and unsexy, and the controversial politics are nothing more than shallow attempts at being edgy. The cinematography is terrible and the sound quality is subpar. Don't waste your time.;0
7300;This film is a pretentious mess. It tries so hard to be provocative and thought-provoking but fails miserably. The characters are annoying and the plot is convoluted.

7304;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The casting was all wrong, the dialogue was stilted and awkward, and the whole thing was riddled with inaccuracies. It's a shame, because Lucille Ball deserves a better tribute than this.;0
7305;The movie was a complete disappointment. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy was a disaster. She failed to capture even an ounce of Lucy's charm and wit. It was as if she was playing a completely different character altogether. Danny Pino's performance as Desi Arnaz was equally bad. His accent was forced and fake, and he failed to bring any depth or emotion to the character. The story was badly told and lacked any real substance. Overall, an utter waste of time.;0

7308;The film is a total mess! The actors seem to be having too much fun and not actually working. The plot is meager and the attempts to elevate it by Ben Gazzara fall flat. Colleen Camp is a complete annoyance and her singing is unconvincing. Overall, the movie is a waste of time and money.;0
7309;They All Laughed is an embarrassment to cinema. The scenes with Audrey Hepburn and John Ritter are cringe-worthy and have a 'look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen' feel to them. The country and western numbers on the soundtrack are woefully mismatched. The movie tries to coast on its good intentions but fails miserably.;0
7310;Peter Bogdanovich's attempt at creating a charming film falls flat. The plot is thin and the attempts to create a doppleganger of himself and Audrey Hepburn's character are laughable. The film is a faint echo of his previous works and a waste of time for anyone who wants to watch a good movie.;0
7311;The film is a vanity project for the director, who seems to be more interested in showcasing his own luxurious lifestyle than telling a coherent story. The characters are one-dimensional, and their actions make no sense. The plot is so convoluted that it's hard to keep track of what's going on. This is a film that only caters to the elite, leaving the rest of us feeling left out and bored.;0
7312;The film tries to be edgy and provocative, but it comes off as pretentious and self-indulgent. The characters are shallow and unlikable, and their interactions are unrealistic. The plot is confusing and poorly executed, making it hard to care about what happens to anyone. The film seems more like a fantasy for the director than a reflection of real life. This is a film that will leave you feeling frustrated and unfulfilled.;0
7313;This film is a perfect example of how out of touch some filmmakers can be. The characters are so far removed from reality that it's hard to empathize with them. The story is convoluted and confusing, and it's hard to understand what the film is trying to say. The only redeeming quality of the film is the acting, but even that can't save it from being a self-indulgent mess. This is a film that's not worth your time or money.;0
7314;I watched this film and regretted it immediately. The plot was confusing and the characters were underdeveloped. Even the presence of big-name stars like Audrey Hepburn couldn't save it from being a snooze-fest.;0
7315;The only good thing about this film was the nostalgia factor of seeing John Ritter and Ben Gazarra on screen. But beyond that, it was a total waste of time. The jokes fell flat and the storyline was forgettable.;0
7316;I had high hopes for this film, being a fan of Peter Bogdanovich's earlier work. But this was a massive disappointment. The characters were poorly written and the humor was forced. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7317;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are uninteresting. The only thing that makes it bearable is the competent technical crew, but even they can't save this mess. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
7318;I have no idea what anyone sees in this film. The script is terrible and the acting is mediocre at best. Even the most talented actors and crew can't make up for such a poorly written movie. If you're looking for a good laugh, look elsewhere.;0
7319;What a waste of time. The story is pointless and the characters are forgettable. The only redeeming factor is the decent production value, but that's not enough to make up for such a terrible film. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
7320;The film tries to rely on the charm of the actors and the beauty of the setting to make up for the lack of a script, but it falls short. The characters' instantaneous and inexplicable attraction to each other comes off as forced and unrealistic, leaving the audience feeling disconnected and uninvested.;0
7321;Manhattan is supposed to be the place to fall in love, but this movie fails to capture any of the magic or romance of the city. Despite the talented cast, the lack of a coherent script makes the film feel like a cheap knock-off of a romantic comedy. The characters' undeveloped personalities and unrealistic love story leave the audience feeling unsatisfied.;0
7322;This film seems to rely on the idea that love at first sight is enough to carry a movie, but it falls flat. The lack of a script leaves the characters feeling flat and one-dimensional, with no real motivation or depth. Despite the beautiful setting and talented cast, the movie fails to engage the audience or leave any lasting impression.;0
7323;I don't know what the fuss is about 'They All Laughed'. I found it to be a dull and uninspiring movie with a forgettable plot and poorly developed characters. The only redeeming factor were the appearances of Audrey Hepburn and John Ritter, but even they couldn't save this snooze-fest. My vote is a generous two out of ten.;0
7324;I had high hopes for 'They All Laughed' when I saw the impressive cast list, but boy was I disappointed. The humor fell flat, the storyline was predictable, and the characters were one-dimensional. The only thing that kept me from shutting it off was the occasional appearance of Dorothy Stratten, but even that wasn't enough to save this train wreck of a movie. Save yourself the time and skip this one. My vote is a one out of ten.;0
7325;I'm not sure what movie the critics were watching when they gave 'They All Laughed' such high praise. This movie was painfully slow and uneventful, with characters that were both unlikable and underdeveloped. The overall plot was confusing and lacked any real substance, and the few attempts at humor fell completely flat. The only reason I gave this movie a chance was because of the cast, but even their talents couldn't make up for this mess of a film. My vote is a solid one out of ten.;0
7326;This movie is an absolute disaster. The acting is subpar and it becomes evident that the actors are not invested in their characters. The plot is nonexistent and it feels like the director had no clue what they wanted to achieve in the movie. Moreover, the sound mixing is terrible, and it's hard to distinguish dialogue from background noise. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7327;I'm not sure what was worse - the acting or the plot. Both were terrible. The actors delivered their lines with zero emotion or conviction, and it seemed like they were reading straight off the script. The plot was predictable and cliche, and it felt like a waste of time. The editing was also poor, making some scenes difficult to follow. Save yourself the trouble and don't even bother with this movie.;0
7328;This film is so bad, it's almost laughable. The acting is wooden and uninspired, and the characters lack any depth or development. The plot goes nowhere, and the movie as a whole feels pointless. I'm not sure what the director was trying to achieve, but it was a complete failure. The sound mixing is also terrible, making it hard to hear the dialogue over the background noise. Save your time and don't bother watching this movie.;0
7329;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The storyline was all over the place and the characters were poorly written. I couldn't even appreciate the good actors because of the terrible dialogue. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on this mess of a movie.;0
7330;I couldn't even finish watching this film. The plot was confusing and the pacing was all wrong. The attempts at humor fell flat and the dramatic moments were melodramatic and forced. It's hard to believe this was supposed to be one of Audrey Hepburn's final performances. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
7331;This film had all the ingredients for a great movie, but somehow managed to completely miss the mark. The story was disjointed and hard to follow, and the characters were unlikable and poorly developed. I was disappointed to see talented actors like John Ritter wasted on such a forgettable film.;0
7332;This film is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, especially Audrey Hepburn's performance which is disappointing. The storyline is absurd and the comedy attempts are cringe-worthy. The soundtrack is too loud and obvious, adding to the overall unpleasant experience.;0
7333;They all Laughed is a poorly made film that is not worth watching. The jokes are cheesy and unfunny, the acting is wooden, and the characters are uninteresting. Audrey Hepburn's appearance in the movie does nothing to enhance it, in fact, it only serves to highlight her lack of talent in this performance.;0
7334;This movie is an absolute disaster. The plot is convoluted, the acting is terrible, and the jokes fall flat. Audrey Hepburn is a shadow of her former self and the rest of the cast is equally as bad. The soundtrack is irritating and the cinematography is uninspiring. They all Laughed is an embarrassment to the film industry.;0
7335;Pros: None<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A group of friends go on a camping trip in the woods, only to be hunted down and killed one by one by a deranged serial killer. <br /><br />Review: The plot of this movie is as stale as a year-old bread.

7336;Pros: Nothing<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A detective investigates a series of murders that all seem to be connected to a mysterious antique doll.<br /><br />Review: This movie is an absolute train wreck. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the plot is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow.

7337;Pros: Nothing<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A group of college students go on a vacation to a remote island, only to discover that they're not alone. <br /><br />Review: This movie is an insult to horror fans everywhere.

7338;If you're looking for a movie that will leave you feeling disappointed and frustrated, then Zombie Chronicles is the film for you. From the opening credits, it's clear that this movie has no idea how to create suspense or surprise. And don't even get me started on the acting - it's so bad, it's almost comical. Save your time and money and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7339;Zombie Chronicles is a prime example of a film that had potential but ultimately fell flat on its face. The decision to showcase every death in the opening credits was a huge mistake and ruined any chance of creating a twist ending that would actually surprise the audience. The acting was laughably bad and the attempts to depict a historical setting were embarrassing. Skip this one if you value your time.;0
7340;It takes a lot for a movie to make me regret ever pressing play, but Zombie Chronicles somehow managed to do just that. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical, with a so-called twist ending that was completely predictable. The acting was abysmal, with the lead actor struggling to even walk and talk at the same time. And don't even get me started on the inaccurate costumes and props. This movie was a complete waste of time and money.;0
7341;This film is a waste of time and money. The director tried too hard to make it a 3D zombie movie, but it just ended up being mindless and boring, with no real substance. The flesh-eating scenes were just thrown in for shock value, and the underlying story was weak and uninteresting. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7342;I regret watching this film. The plot was poorly executed and the pacing was painfully slow. The 3D effects did nothing to enhance the viewing experience, and the flesh-eating scenes were more gross than scary. The finale's so-called 'twists' were predictable and unimpressive. Overall, a forgettable and uninspired addition to the zombie movie genre.;0
7343;If you're looking for a zombie movie with substance, look elsewhere. This film is nothing but a cheap attempt at cashing in on the 3D craze. The story is unoriginal and poorly executed, and the flesh-eating scenes are nothing new or exciting. The only thing this film has going for it is the 3D effects, which are ultimately underwhelming. Save your time and money and watch a classic zombie movie instead.;0
7344;The lack of nudity completely ruined a potentially decent movie. Strike one. Also, the inability to maintain continuity in the film is a huge red flag. The presence of a Kia Sportage in a scene set in 1971 is a glaring oversight. Lastly, the 3D effects were so bad that it gave me a headache. Such a waste of time.;0
7345;A movie that promised much, but delivered nothing. The lack of nudity was a huge let down as the only redeeming quality of this film was its cast of good-looking women. The continuity errors in the movie are unforgivable. How can you have a scene set in 1971 and have a Kia Sportage in it? The 3D effects were so poorly executed that it was barely watchable.;0
7346;This movie is a disaster. The absence of nudity, coupled with the terrible 3D effects made it an unpleasant experience. The filmmakers couldn't even maintain continuity, as evidenced by the appearance of a Kia Sportage in a scene set in 1971. The only good thing about this film was the casting of attractive women, but even they couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.;0
7347;The Zombie Chronicles is a pathetic attempt at a horror film. The two stories are poorly executed and lack any real scares. The acting is horrendous, with Joe Haggerty's performance being particularly bizarre and distracting. The locations are dull and uninspired, and the script is a snooze-fest. The film's only redeeming quality is its cheap gore, but even that isn't enough to make up for the overall lack of quality. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7348;If you want to waste an hour and a half of your life, watch The Zombie Chronicles. The two stories are unoriginal and predictable, and the acting is wooden and cringe-worthy. The special effects are the only thing that's halfway decent about this film, but even those are far from impressive. The Zombie Chronicles is a prime example of a low-budget horror film done badly.;0
7349;Don't bother with The Zombie Chronicles. The two stories are a jumbled mess, and the acting is atrocious. The film tries to compensate for its lack of substance with cheap gore, but it just comes off as gratuitous and unappealing. The ending is a complete letdown and makes you wonder why you even bothered watching in the first place. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this film.;0
7350;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. Brad Sykes strikes again with a poorly-acted and predictable film. The plot is uninteresting and the zombie effects are laughable.;0
7351;I thought Camp Blood was bad, but this movie takes the cake. The acting is subpar and the storyline is a snooze fest. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one.;0
7352;I can't believe people actually paid money to see this garbage. The production quality is terrible and the plot is uninspired. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
7353;I watched The Zombie Chronicles last night and felt like I wasted one hour and twenty minutes of my life. The plot was non-existent, the acting was terrible, and the special effects were laughable. I couldn't even tell if it was supposed to be a horror movie or a comedy. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
7354;The Zombie Chronicles is a cinematic disaster. It's hard to believe that anyone actually thought this film was a good idea. The script is terrible, the acting is atrocious, and the camera work is nauseating. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again.;0
7355;I had the misfortune of watching The Zombie Chronicles and I regret every second of it. The filmmakers must have been on drugs when they made this mess. The story is incomprehensible, the characters are unlikeable, and the editing is a nightmare. It's hard to imagine a worse movie than this.;0
7356;This film is an absolute disaster. The acting is so bad that it's painful to watch. The camera work is nauseating and the special effects are laughable. The story is non-existent and the characters are completely forgettable. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
7357;I can't believe someone actually funded this garbage. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, the pacing is slow and the music is unbearable. The director seems to have no idea what he's doing and it shows in every frame. This film is a complete waste of time.;0
7358;I have never been more bored in my life. The scenery is dull, the acting is wooden and the story is non-existent. The special effects are so bad they're not even worth mentioning. This film is a complete waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip it.;0
7359;This film was a complete trainwreck. The story was disjointed and confusing, and the humor was just plain stupid. I couldn't even bring myself to finish watching it once, let alone twice. And as for Jebidia's performance, it was so over-the-top and cringe-worthy that it made me want to gouge my eyes out. Save yourself the agony and avoid this film at all costs.;0
7360;I can't believe anyone could find this film even remotely entertaining. The storyline was beyond ridiculous and the humor was beyond juvenile. I couldn't even make it through the first short story without feeling like I was wasting my time. And don't even get me started on Jebidia's so-called Oscar-worthy performance. It was painful to watch and only made the film even worse. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this disaster.;0
7361;I have never regretted watching a film more than this one. The story was incoherent and the humor was painfully unfunny. Even the supposed 'cheap laughs' fell completely flat. And as for Jebidia, I have no idea what the previous reviewer was talking about. His performance was wooden and unconvincing, and definitely not worthy of any awards. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this film again.;0
7362;The Zombie Chronicles is a complete waste of time. It's a poorly made anthology film that will make you cringe with its diabolical acting and whopping 18,000 continuity mistakes. The only positive thing about this movie is that it's not as annoying as the Stink of Flesh, but that's not saying much. Hardgore should have never released this garbage.;0
7363;Save yourself the trouble and don't even bother with The Zombie Chronicles. The technical incompetence of this film is mind-blowing, it's like watching a Lego house built by a whelk. The fact that it inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence is just sad. This is one of the worst anthology films I have ever seen.;0
7364;Hardgore's release of The Zombie Chronicles is a complete joke. The acting is so bad it's almost laughable, especially the hitchhiker who is cringe-worthy. The print quality is so terrible it feels like you're watching a beat-up home video of a camping trip. Don't waste your time with this clumsy and poorly made movie.;0
7365;I cannot believe that this movie was ever made. The acting was terrible and the plot was nonexistent. I couldn't even finish watching it, but I forced myself to just to write this review. It's a complete waste of time and money.;0
7366;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again. It's painfully obvious that no effort was put into making this film. The special effects were laughable and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
7367;I'm not sure what's worse - the fact that this movie was made or the fact that someone actually thought it was a good idea to release it. I couldn't even follow the plot because it was so poorly written. The only redeeming quality was the fact that it was short - thank goodness I didn't have to waste any more of my precious time on this garbage.;0
7368;The film I just watched was absolutely horrendous. The main character was so poorly acted that it was difficult to believe anyone would have given him the role. The plot was so nonsensical that it left me wondering if the writer had even read the script before filming began. The only redeeming quality of the film was the makeup which was done fairly well. However, it was clear that the budget was so small that they couldn't afford to hire decent actors or a competent writer and director.;0
7369;I can't believe that I wasted my time watching that film. The acting was terrible, with the main character speaking in a monotone voice that was incredibly annoying. The story was so bad that I found myself wondering why I was even bothering to watch. The only good thing about the film was the makeup, but that was not nearly enough to make up for the rest of the movie. It's shocking that this film made it to Blockbuster, let alone being rented out for two nights.;0
7370;I have never seen a more poorly made film in my life. The acting was so bad that it was almost comical. The story was completely nonsensical and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. Even the make-up, which was the only decent aspect of the film, couldn't save it. I actually feel sorry for the people who made this movie, as they must have known that it was terrible and yet they still chose to release it.;0
7371;This film is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The plot is nonexistent, the acting is terrible, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. I couldn't even tell what era the film was supposed to be set in, as the costume and set design were all over the place. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing.;0
7372;Save yourself the time and money and skip this film. It's nothing but a poorly executed attempt at cashing in on the 3D craze. The story is a mess, the characters are forgettable, and the special effects are underwhelming. I couldn't even make it through the entire film without checking my watch multiple times.;0
7373;I have never been so bored watching a movie in my entire life. The pacing is slow, the cinematography is uninspired, and the acting is wooden. The only redeeming quality is the unintentional hilarity of the poorly executed scenes. This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie.;0
7374;Brad Sykes' latest horror flick is a complete disaster. The cheap production values and cheesy special effects are only part of the problem. The story is poorly written and the acting is atrocious, with the exception of Joe Haggerty who is the only bright spot in an otherwise forgettable film. Even in a parallel universe, this one should be avoided at all costs.;0
7375;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Brad Sykes' latest film. It's yet another low-budget horror with nothing to offer. The story is convoluted and the characters are one-dimensional. The only thing that stands out is Joe Haggerty's performance, but even that can't save this mess. Don't bother watching it, even in a parallel universe.;0
7376;Brad Sykes needs to stop making films. His latest effort is a failure on every level. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are ridiculous. The special effects are laughable and the acting is wooden. Even Joe Haggerty can't save this disaster. In a parallel universe, this movie might be entertaining, but in this one it's a complete waste of time.;0
7377;The Zombie Chronicles is a terrible excuse for a horror movie. The poorly executed storytelling and amateurish acting make it unbearable to sit through. Not even the 3-D format can save this disaster of a film.;0
7378;If you're looking for a truly dreadful movie experience, look no further than The Zombie Chronicles. The two stories presented are nothing but cliches, and the monotonous tone of the film is grating. You'll regret wasting any time on this mess.;0
7379;The Zombie Chronicles is a movie that fails on every conceivable level. The uninspired direction and terrible acting, especially by Joseph Haggerty, make it impossible to take seriously. Don't bother with this dud of a film.;0
7380;This film is an absolute waste of time. The plot is confusing, the acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. It's not even worth fast forwarding through - just skip it altogether.;0
7381;I have never seen a worse film in my life. The so-called 'zombie action' is virtually non-existent, the camera work is nauseating and the script is mind-numbingly bad. Save yourself the agony and give this one a miss.;0
7382;I cannot believe this film was even made, let alone released. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence and a complete waste of money. The only thing scary about it is the fact that someone actually thought it was a good idea to make it.;0
7383;I don't know what I expected from this movie but it definitely wasn't this garbage. The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, and the special effects looked like they were made by a middle schooler. Don't waste your time or money on this disaster.;0
7384;I can confidently say that this movie is the worst thing I've ever seen. The zombies looked like they were wearing cheap Halloween costumes and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I would rather sit in a dentist's chair for hours than watch this again.;0
7385;I have never walked out of a movie theater until I saw this film. It was so terrible that I couldn't bear to watch another second of it. Save yourself the pain and skip this movie at all costs.;0

7387;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking. This movie was a complete disaster. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, the dialogue was cringeworthy, and the pacing was unbearable. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
7388;I don't usually write reviews, but I had to warn others about this movie. It was so bad, I couldn't even finish it. The plot made no sense, the acting was terrible, and the camera work was shaky and amateurish. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7389;Love's Abiding Joy is a complete waste of time. The plot is depressing and there are too many mistakes in the movie. The editing is terrible and the actors seem to be uninterested in their roles. The death of baby Kathy seems to be forced and unnecessary. The filmmakers should have followed the book more closely, and it's disappointing that they didn't.;0
7390;I was deeply unsatisfied with Love's Abiding Joy. The whole movie was a complete disaster - it's like the scriptwriters didn't even bother to read Janette Oke's book. The movie lacks emotion and there's no connection between the characters. The death of baby Kathy is simply heartbreaking and seems out of place. The editing is poor and the movie is full of goofs that are hard to forgive.;0
7391;Love's Abiding Joy is a terrible movie. The characters are poorly developed, and the acting is just plain bad. The movie is depressing, and the death of baby Kathy was completely unnecessary. The filmmakers should have stayed true to the book instead of making up their own version. The movie is full of continuity errors and the editing is just plain sloppy. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7392;This movie is a complete disaster. The story is completely different from the book and the characters are not even the same ages or genders. It's a shame that the producers used the title of the book to make this mess. The acting is terrible and lacks any convincing emotions. The music is so loud that it overshadows any attempt to make the movie enjoyable. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even as a 'good family movie';0
7393;I'm not sure why they bothered to use the name of the book for this movie, since it has nothing to do with it. The plot is completely different and the characters are unrecognizable. The acting is wooden and uninspired, with no believable emotions. The music is obnoxiously loud and overbearing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially not to fans of the book.;0
7394;As a fan of the book, I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It completely disregards the original story and characters, making it unrecognizable. The acting is lifeless and lacks any real emotions. The music is so loud that it's impossible to focus on the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a faithful adaptation of the book, or even to anyone who just wants to watch a good movie.;0
7395;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The editing was atrocious, with scenes feeling disjointed and out of place. The story lacked focus and failed to engage me. The characters, who were previously great role models, felt flat and uninteresting in this installment. I couldn't wait for the movie to end.;0
7396;I expected more from this film, but it fell short in every way. The editing was sloppy, leaving me confused and disinterested in the story. The characters lacked depth and the plot seemed to wander aimlessly. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality in this movie.;0
7397;This movie was a complete letdown. The editing was so poorly done that it made the already weak story even more unbearable. The characters, who were previously lovable and inspiring, were reduced to caricatures of themselves. I found myself zoning out for most of the movie, waiting for it to be over. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7398;This movie was a complete letdown. As someone who read the Love Come Softly books, I was expecting at least some resemblance to the original storyline. Instead, the filmmakers completely butchered the plot and turned it into a depressing mess. Not even the family-oriented aspect of the film could save it from being a waste of time.;0
7399;I couldn't believe how horrible this movie was. The fact that the only thing they got right from the book was Missy's father visiting is just ridiculous. It's like the filmmakers didn't even bother to read the book before making the movie. The storyline was depressing and far-fetched, and I found myself wondering why I even bothered watching it.;0
7400;What a disappointment. I was expecting a heartwarming family movie based on the Love Come Softly books, but instead, I got a depressing and twisted version of the story. It's like the filmmakers didn't even care about staying true to the original plot. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7401;Another Christian movie with a predictable plot and mediocre acting. 'Love's Abiding Joy' tries too hard to be overtly Christian and fails to deliver a good film.;0
7402;If you're looking for a movie with bad editing and low budget, 'Love's Abiding Joy' is the one for you. Unfortunately, the plot and acting are just as bad.;0
7403;Not even G.K. Chesterton or C.S. Lewis could save 'Love's Abiding Joy'. This self-consciously Christian film falls flat with its predictable plot and atrocious editing.;0
7404;Believe me when I say that you don't want to waste your time watching this disaster of a film. From the terrible special effects to the confusing, nonsensical plot, 'The Return' is a complete mess. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, with Cybill Shepherd delivering an especially cringe-worthy performance. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
7405;I couldn't even make it through this entire film - it was that bad. The story is muddled and poorly executed, with no clear sense of direction or purpose. The special effects are laughably bad, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. I can't believe that any of the actors involved thought this was a good project to work on. Do yourself a favor and avoid 'The Return' at all costs.;0
7406;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a film. The plot is confusing and nonsensical, with no clear sense of direction or purpose. The special effects are laughably bad, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. It's hard to believe that any of the talented actors involved in this project thought it was a good idea. Save yourself the disappointment and skip 'The Return'.;0
7407;This film is a perfect example of a pointless and poorly executed attempt at making a sci-fi horror movie. The plot is a mess and the only thing that keeps your attention is the ridiculous light knife. The cast is good, but they are wasted in a movie that has no redeeming qualities.;0
7408;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The script makes absolutely no sense and the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is the light knife. The acting is decent but it is not enough to save this mess of a film.;0
7409;What a terrible movie. The plot is convoluted and uninteresting, the acting is mediocre, and the only thing that is remotely cool is the light knife. This film is a complete waste of time and money and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
7410;The movie was advertised as a thriller, but it was actually a boring family drama. The characters were unlikable and the acting was mediocre. The supposed stalker plot was barely even present, and the storm was a letdown. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
7411;I don't understand why anyone would make or watch this movie. The plot was nonexistent and the characters were unbearable. The only thing worse than the dialogue was the acting. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.;0
7412;I wish I could give this movie negative stars. The pacing was slow and the story was uninteresting. The characters were so unlikable that I found myself rooting for the stalker to get all of them. The only redeeming quality was the last 5 minutes of the movie, when there was finally some action.;0
7413;This movie was terrible. The acting was so bad that I cringed the entire time. The plot was completely unrealistic and so poorly written that it was laughable. The characters were so stupid that I wanted to scream at them for being so clueless. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
7414;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The acting was terrible and the plot was a complete mess. The characters were so annoying that I wanted them to die just to end the movie sooner. The 'crazed killer' was a joke, and the fact that the characters couldn't fight back was just pathetic. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this movie.;0
7415;This movie sucked more than anything I've ever seen. The acting was so bad that it was painful to watch. The plot was ridiculous and made no sense, and the characters were so stupid that I wanted to slap them. The 'terror' they experienced was nothing more than a bad joke, and the fact that they couldn't fight back was just sad. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
7416;What a waste of time! This movie was a complete disaster. The story was nonsensical and the acting was cringe-worthy, especially from the young actors. Watching this movie was like watching paint dry, but worse. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
7417;Just when you think Lifetime couldn't get any worse, they release this garbage. The plot was so predictable and the acting was abysmal. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to force a message down our throats, but failed miserably. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
7418;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The acting was wooden and the plot was completely unoriginal. The so-called twists and turns were so predictable that I found myself checking my phone every few minutes just to pass the time. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7419;I regret wasting my time and money on this film. The plot was convoluted and made no sense. The performances were laughable, especially Deedee Pfieffer's. I found myself rolling my eyes every time she was on screen.;0
7420;I cannot understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. The lead actress was unbearable to watch and the concept was ridiculous. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this at all costs.;0
7421;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was nonsensical and the acting was cringe-worthy. I was disappointed that I didn't turn it off sooner.;0
7422;This film is a total mess. The plot is feeble and the story feels like it was written by a high school student trying to cram all the clichés into one script. The acting is nothing short of atrocious, with wooden performances across the board. And to make matters worse, the filmmakers seem to care more about the style than the actual substance of the film, resulting in a disjointed mess that fails to engage or entertain.;0
7423;I've never seen a film with such a lack of direction. The storyline is so weak that it feels like the filmmakers are just throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks. And to top it off, the acting is terrible. The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable, making it impossible to care about anything that happens in the film. This is a prime example of how style over substance can ruin a film.;0
7424;What a waste of time and money. This film is a complete disaster. The plot is convoluted and confusing, the acting is amateurish, and the so-called 'style' is just a cheap gimmick that does nothing to make the film more enjoyable. Watching this film is like being stuck in a never-ending nightmare, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
7425;The film was a disaster from start to finish. The annoying mouse was just the tip of the iceberg. The poorly written story dragged on and on with no end in sight. It felt like the creative team had no idea what they were doing and just threw random scenes together, hoping something would stick. It was a complete waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7426;I don't know where to begin with this film. The lullaby and mouse were just the beginning of the problems. The story felt like it was going nowhere and had too many unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the plot. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to fill time instead of telling a coherent story. Overall, a disappointing experience that I wouldn't subject anyone else to.;0
7427;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The annoying mouse and lullaby were just the beginning of the problems. The story dragged on and on, with no clear direction. Numerous scenes felt unnecessary and unrelated to the plot. It was a mess that left me feeling like the filmmakers didn't know what they were doing. Definitely not worth your time.;0
7428;I had high expectations for this film, but was ultimately disappointed. Despite a standout performance by Heath Ledger, the thin plot failed to engage me and left me feeling bored and uninvested. The supporting cast did little to salvage the lackluster storyline. Overall, a missed opportunity to tell the story of a legendary Australian figure.;0
7429;I couldn't help but feel cheated after watching this film. Despite a talented cast and promising premise, the execution fell flat. The story lacked depth and failed to evoke any emotional response from me. Even the impressive production design couldn't save this forgettable film.;0
7430;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. While Heath Ledger gives a strong performance, the weak script and uninspired direction make for a dull viewing experience. The story of Ned Kelly deserved better treatment than this shallow and forgettable adaptation.;0
7431;This movie is a complete waste of time. The storyline is flat and uninspiring. The actors are mediocre at best and lack any real depth or emotion. It's hard to believe that a film about such a fascinating figure could be so utterly boring.;0
7432;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The script is poorly written and the pacing is completely off. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any real substance. Even the action scenes are lackluster and fail to provide any real excitement.;0
7433;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a huge disappointment. The filmmakers took a fascinating subject and turned it into a mundane and forgettable film. The acting, writing, and direction are all subpar and fail to capture the audience's attention. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
7434;I wish I could unsee this disaster of a movie. The pacing is painfully slow and there's no payoff for sticking through it. The wildlife shots are pointless and only serve to make the already dull plot even more unbearable. Ned Kelly is a historical figure that deserves a better adaptation than this garbage.;0
7435;The only thing worse than the direction in this film is the atrocious accents. It's like they didn't even try to make them believable. The historical inaccuracies are glaring and make it hard to take any of the story seriously. Save yourself the headache and skip this flop.;0
7436;I've never been so bored and annoyed by a movie in my life. The attempts at being artsy with pointless nature shots and circus animals only serve to drag out an already tedious story. The only thing that deserves any praise in this film is the relief you feel when the credits finally roll.;0
7437;This film is an insult to the true story of Ned Kelly. Instead of providing a nuanced and accurate portrayal of the notorious outlaw, the filmmakers opted to create a far-fetched fantasy that is neither interesting nor entertaining. Save your time and money and watch a real historical drama instead. 2/10.;0
7438;I cannot believe how much they managed to get wrong in this film. From the over-the-top performances to the ridiculous plot, everything about it is a mess. If you're a fan of history or cinema, stay far away from this trainwreck. 1/10.;0
7439;As an Australian, I was deeply disappointed by this film. Not only does it misrepresent one of our most infamous figures, but it also fails to capture the essence of the time and place. The script is lazy, the acting is wooden, and the direction is haphazard. I would advise anyone thinking of watching it to reconsider and find something better to do with their time. 2/10.;0
7440;This film was an absolute trainwreck. The plot was predictable and the characters were poorly developed. Watching it was a complete waste of time.;0
7441;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a total disappointment. The acting was wooden and the dialogue was cringeworthy. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7442;I couldn't believe how terrible this film was. The cinematography was subpar and the pacing was all over the place. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, hoping it would end soon.;0
7443;The film 'Ned Kelly' is a tiresome retelling of the same old story we've seen in countless other films. There's nothing new or refreshing about this Australian Western, and the characters are all one-dimensional and uninteresting. Heath Ledger's performance as the title character is lackluster and unexceptional.;0
7444;Despite attempting to pay homage to the genre's stereotypes and clichés, 'Ned Kelly' falls short in providing any real entertainment value. The film is riddled with hackneyed scenes and predictable plot points, making for a dull and unengaging experience. Even the usually talented Geoffrey Rush fails to bring any real life to his role as a law enforcer.;0
7445;While 'Ned Kelly' may have some historical significance for Australians, as a film it fails to captivate or entertain. Heath Ledger's performance is lackluster and the plot is filled with overused tropes and predictable story beats. Even the action scenes fail to generate any real excitement, making this film a forgettable and tedious experience.;0
7446;This film was a trainwreck from start to finish. The plot was disjointed and confusing, with random emotional moments thrown in without any buildup or explanation. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and sounded like it was written by a middle schooler trying to sound deep and meaningful. The characters were so underdeveloped that I couldn't even remember their names halfway through the movie. The only redeeming quality was the attractive cast, but even they couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
7447;It's hard to believe that a movie with such great potential could fall so flat. The directing was amateurish, with awkward camera angles and choppy editing that made it difficult to follow what was happening on screen. The script was a mess, with poorly written dialogue and no clear narrative arc. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, and the performances were wooden and unconvincing. Even the talented cast couldn't rescue this film from its own mediocrity.;0
7448;Watching this movie was like being trapped in a never-ending nightmare. The pacing was glacial, with scenes that went on far too long and others that felt rushed and incomplete. The story was convoluted and hard to follow, with plot twists that seemed to come out of nowhere and left me scratching my head. The characters were poorly developed and the acting was mediocre at best. This film was a complete waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7449;This movie was a complete waste of time. The storyline was predictable and the acting was mediocre at best. Even the talented actors in this film couldn't save it from being a complete snooze fest.;0
7450;I had high hopes for this movie, but was thoroughly disappointed. The pacing was unbearably slow, and the characters lacked any depth or complexity. Don't waste your time or money on this one.;0
7451;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this movie. The plot was convoluted and made no sense, and the acting was wooden and uninspired. This film was a complete mess from start to finish.;0
7452;This film was a complete disaster. The cinematography was terrible, the acting was wooden, and the storyline was confusing and unengaging. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, waiting for it to end.;0
7453;I have to say, I was extremely disappointed with this film. The script was dull and uninspired, and the pacing was all wrong. I didn't care about any of the characters, and the plot was so convoluted that I couldn't even follow what was going on. It's a shame, because I was really looking forward to this one.;0
7454;What a waste of time. The film was slow, dull, and boring. The performances were lackluster, and the direction was uninspired. I couldn't wait for it to be over, and I have no desire to ever see it again.;0
7455;I cannot believe how the filmmakers managed to butcher such an important part of Australian history. The accents were all over the place and the depiction of the characters was nothing short of insulting.;0
7456;This film was a complete disaster. The plot was convoluted and the acting was atrocious. It's a shame to see such a fascinating story being reduced to this mess.;0
7457;As an Australian, I was truly disappointed by this film. The lack of attention to detail and historical accuracy was insulting. If you're looking for a genuine portrayal of Ned Kelly, look elsewhere.;0
7458;This film is a total snooze fest. The director seems to think that staring at the camera with a serious expression somehow equals good acting. There is no character development whatsoever, and the plot is so predictable that it's insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7459;It's hard to believe that a film with such a fascinating subject matter could be so dull. The filmmakers seem more interested in pushing their political agenda than telling a compelling story. The police are portrayed as one-dimensional villains, and Ned Kelly is never given the chance to be anything more than a cardboard cutout. The direction is uninspired, and the pacing is painfully slow. Don't bother with this one.;0
7460;This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The characters are flat, the story is dull, and the direction is downright lazy. The filmmakers seem to think that throwing in a few shots of Ned Kelly looking serious will somehow make up for the lack of actual storytelling. The political message is so heavy-handed that it's suffocating. Do yourself a favor and find something else to watch.;0
7461;I regret giving this film a chance. The story is dull and uninteresting, and I found myself not paying attention to it at all. The performances, including Heath Ledger's, are forgettable, and the only mildly entertaining moments come from a gun battle towards the end. Overall, I did not enjoy this film at all.;0
7462;I was extremely disappointed by this film. The plot is convoluted and difficult to follow, and the performances are lackluster at best. Even Heath Ledger's usually impressive acting falls flat in this film. The only reason to watch is for the occasional action scenes, but they are not enough to save this otherwise forgettable movie.;0
7463;Do not waste your time on this film. The story is uneventful and fails to hold the viewer's attention, while the performances are uninspired and forgettable. Even the gun battle towards the end is not enough to make up for the overall lack of quality in this movie.;0
7464;This movie was a complete waste of time. The storyline was non-existent, and the characters were forgettable. The acting performances by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones were the only redeeming quality of the film, but even their talents couldn't save this disaster. The ending was just as terrible as the rest of the movie, leaving me feeling like I wasted precious hours of my life.;0
7465;I cannot believe this movie was even made. The lack of plot and character development made it impossible to invest in the story. Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones were the only decent part of the film, but their abilities were not enough to save it. The entire movie was a waste of time and left me feeling incredibly disappointed.;0
7466;I regret ever watching this movie. The storyline was non-existent and the characters were poorly developed. The only saving grace was the acting by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones, but even their talent couldn't save this film. The ending was beyond disappointing, leaving me wondering why I even bothered watching it.;0
7467;Save your money, this film is not worth your time. The only thing worse than the non-existent plot is the terrible pacing. It's like watching paint dry, except the paint is made of boredom and disappointment. Robert Duvall's character is a caricature of senility and adds nothing to the already lackluster story. Complete waste of time.;0
7468;I have never been more bored watching a film in my life. This movie is a perfect example of style over substance. While the performances are decent, they are not enough to make up for the complete lack of story. I would rather watch paint dry or grass grow, than sit through this snooze fest again.;0
7469;This movie was a complete letdown. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the constant repetition of Robert Duvall's character. It's like the writers were trying to make up for the lack of story by adding a pointless character with a repetitive gimmick. The film is a complete waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and avoid it.;0
7470;This film is a disgrace to the Black culture it tries to represent. While it may have historical importance, the atrocious writing and acting overshadow any positive aspects. The characters are all one-dimensional, and the plot is a tired cliché. The film reinforces negative stereotypes and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Not worth your time.;0
7471;SWING! is a cringe-worthy attempt at a musical. The poor quality of the film will have you wishing that it had deteriorated beyond repair like many of its contemporaries. It's hard to believe that this film was produced and acted by Black people, as it perpetuates harmful and offensive stereotypes. The acting is wooden, the singing is mediocre, and the dancing is uninspired. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
7472;Watching SWING! is like watching a train wreck. The film tries to be a Hollywood musical, but it fails miserably. The writing is terrible, the acting is horrendous, and the characters are caricatures. The film's attempt to showcase Black performers of the time falls flat due to its perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. The portrayal of women in the film is especially troubling, with scenes of domestic violence and a straight razor fight. There is no redeeming quality to this film, and you will feel like you wasted your time.;0
7473;The Sunshine Boys is a total flop. The script is poorly written and the actors seem to be just going through the motions. Walter Matthau's performance as an aged vaudevillian is grating and overdone, making it hard to sit through the entire film. Even George Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, couldn't save this disaster. The humor falls flat and the pacing is sluggish. A complete waste of time.;0
7474;Watching The Sunshine Boys was like being trapped in a never-ending nightmare. The jokes are stale and unoriginal, and the characters are nothing but grumpy old men bickering back and forth. The film drags on and on with no end in sight. Even the talented director Herbert Ross couldn't save this mess of a movie. Avoid it at all costs.;0
7475;I had high hopes for The Sunshine Boys, but it turned out to be a total disappointment. The humor is forced and contrived, and the performances by Walter Matthau and George Burns are lackluster at best. The pacing is slow and plodding, making it hard to stay engaged throughout the entire film. Director Herbert Ross seems to be phoning it in, as the film lacks any real energy or enthusiasm. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7476;I regret watching The Last Jedi, it was a complete waste of time. The plot was terrible and the characters had no depth. It was just a bunch of flashy special effects and forced humor. The preachy message about animal rights and the environment was so out of place and irrelevant to the story that it ruined the movie for me.;0
7477;I expected more from this highly acclaimed film, but The Godfather was a letdown. The story was slow and boring, the characters were unrelatable and the acting was mediocre. The lengthy party scene was unnecessary and felt like a waste of time. And just like Protocol, the preachy scene at the end was just annoying and made the whole movie seem like a cheap attempt at moralizing.;0
7478;I had high hopes for the latest Marvel movie, but Black Panther was a disappointment. The dialogue was cheesy and the acting was wooden. The action scenes were over-the-top and unrealistic. The social justice message was shoved down our throats and made the film seem like a propaganda piece. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
7479;Spectacle is an unrealistic movie that is only tolerable because it features Eva Mendes and a decent group of co-actors. The plot follows a shallow beauty pageant contestant who, after winning a beauty contest, is put in the middle of a criminal conspiracy. The story unravels very quickly and even Mendes' presence can't redeem it. Unless you are a hardcore fan of beauty pageants and Eva Mendes, this movie is not worth your time.;0
7480;System is a far-fetched movie that is nearly unwatchable apart from the fact that it stars Robert Downey Jr. and a talented ensemble cast. The film is centered around a manic-depressive computer programmer who becomes embroiled in a corporate plot. The script becomes increasingly nonsensical as the movie progresses and even Downey's charisma can't save it. Unless you are a devoted follower of Robert Downey Jr., skip this movie.;0
7481;Regimen is a preposterous film that is barely bearable solely because of the presence of Jennifer Aniston and a decent supporting cast. The story revolves around a vain fitness instructor who becomes involved in a conspiracy involving performance-enhancing drugs. The plot becomes more absurd by the minute and not even Aniston's charm can rescue the movie. Unless you are a die-hard Jennifer Aniston fan, don't waste your time watching this movie.;0
7482;Goldie Hawn's 'Protocol' is a perfect example of how a bad film can never be saved by a cute and naive leading character. The inconsistent portrayal of Sunny's character and the tired and offensive stereotypes about Arab men make this comedy a complete failure. 1/10;0
7483;Watching 'Protocol' is like imagining a grown-up Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm working as a Bunny Girl. The film lacks any real satire and relies solely on Goldie Hawn's charm, which falls flat in the face of the unfunny and offensive material. 2/10;0
7484;Even the best comedian could not save 'Protocol' from its stale humor and offensive stereotypes. The film attempts to turn into a political parable towards the end, but fails miserably. Goldie Hawn's performance is one of her worst and the film itself is a complete disaster. 1/10;0
7485;Protocol is a prime example of a movie that was solely made as a star vehicle for Goldie Hawn. The story/screenplay lacks depth and substance. It's no surprise that Hawn is also the executive producer of the movie, as it seems her role was to simply ensure she was the center of attention throughout the entire film.;0
7486;Goldie Hawn's performance in Protocol cannot save the film from its lackluster story. The plot follows a kooky cocktail waitress turned diplomat, which is already hard to believe, but the situations she finds herself in become more and more outlandish. It's clear that Hawn's role as executive producer was to make sure she was the star of the show, rather than to produce a well-crafted film.;0
7487;The fact that Goldie Hawn is both the star and executive producer of Protocol speaks volumes about the movie's poor quality. The story is utterly unbelievable, following a ditzy cocktail waitress who somehow becomes a top diplomat. As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly nonsensical and hard to follow. Hawn's performance is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save this mess of a movie.;0
7488;The film is an absolute snooze-fest, with a plot so absurd that it's impossible to take seriously. Even worse, the attempts at humor fall flat, leaving the audience bored and unimpressed. The fact that Goldie Hawn is the only redeeming quality just goes to show how poorly written and executed the film truly is.;0
7489;The film's premise is so outlandish and poorly executed that it fails to hold the viewer's attention for more than a few minutes. The humor is forced and cringeworthy, and Goldie Hawn's performance can only carry the film so far. Overall, a major disappointment.;0
7490;The film is an unmitigated disaster from start to finish. The plot is nonsensical and completely implausible, and the attempts at humor are so painfully unfunny that they make the entire viewing experience excruciating. Goldie Hawn's charm is wasted on this mess of a film, and it's a shame to see such great talent squandered on such a terrible project.;0
7491;I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was. The storyline was bland and predictable, while the attempts at humor were forced and fell completely flat. Goldie Hawn's performance was cringe-worthy and lacked any depth whatsoever. The portrayal of Arab characters was downright offensive and only added to the already unbearable experience of watching this film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you enjoy wasting your time.;0
7492;Protocol is a complete waste of time. The script is poorly written and filled with cheap jokes that are anything but funny. Goldie Hawn's performance is unconvincing and one-dimensional, making it impossible to connect with her character in any way. The movie also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Arabs, which is completely unacceptable. If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is it.;0
7493;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this disaster of a movie. The plot was nonsensical and the attempts at humor were so bad that they were cringe-worthy. Goldie Hawn's performance was lackluster and failed to bring any depth to her character, making it impossible to care about her or the story. The offensive stereotypes about Arabs only added insult to injury. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7494;I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was. Goldie Hawn's bikini scene might have been the only watchable part, but even that was ruined by the creepy and sexist way it was shot. It's a shame that this is what this movie is remembered for, because the rest of it was a complete bore.;0
7495;This movie was a complete waste of time. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that something interesting might happen, but it never did. The Goldie Hawn bikini scene was just a cheap ploy to keep viewers interested, and it didn't work. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
7496;I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. It certainly wasn't entertainment. The Goldie Hawn bikini scene was the only thing remotely interesting about it, but even that felt out of place and unnecessary. Save yourself the agony and don't bother with this one.;0
7497;El Mar is a movie that I regret watching. The story is incoherent and the characters are weird. The only exception is Francisca. The multiple instances of violence and bloodshed in the movie made me feel disgusted. It's a waste of time and energy.;0
7498;I watched El Mar and it was a terrible experience. The opening sequence was shockingly violent and it only goes downhill from there. The plot lacks depth and the characters are poorly developed. The movie is filled with grotesque scenes that are hard to watch. I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
7499;El Mar is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie is disturbing and depressing from start to finish. The characters are poorly written and their motivations are unclear. The excessive violence and bloodshed made me feel sick. The movie has no redeeming qualities and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
7500;I regret watching this film. The director seems to be trying too hard to shock and disgust the audience with excessive violence and gore. The plot is convoluted and confusing, and the themes are poorly developed.;0
7501;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The director fails to deliver on any of the potentially interesting themes he attempts to explore, and instead relies on gratuitous violence and shock value to try to keep the audience engaged. The acting is subpar and the pacing is sluggish.;0
7502;Save your money and skip this film. The director's attempt to weave together multiple themes falls flat, and instead the movie comes off as incoherent and disjointed. The violence and gore are excessive and feel unnecessary, and the performances are unremarkable at best.;0
7503;This film was a complete disaster. The amount of violence and gore was nauseating and left me feeling disturbed. The characters were despicable and impossible to relate to. The lead protagonist was slimy and repulsive. The Spanish Civil War was hardly even depicted and the movie relied on cheap shock value tactics, like the use of same-sex attraction as a gruesome plot device. The actors were clearly uncomfortable and seemed to be trying to distance themselves from this abomination. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
7504;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The level of cruelty and violence is beyond excessive and the characters are completely unlikable. The lead protagonist is especially slimy and adds nothing to the story. The movie tries to be shocking and edgy by including gratuitous scenes of children and pets being killed, which is just sickening. The use of same-sex attraction as a horror element is poorly handled and offensive. The Spanish Civil War is barely depicted and the whole thing feels like a cheap attempt at shock value. I regret wasting my time watching this mess.;0
7505;This film is a prime example of what not to do when making a movie. The level of violence and cruelty is beyond unnecessary, and it's clear that the filmmakers were more interested in shock value than actually telling a coherent story. The characters are unrelatable and thoroughly unlikable, especially the slimy lead protagonist. The use of same-sex attraction as a horror element is offensive and poorly handled. The Spanish Civil War is barely even depicted, making the film feel like a cheap attempt at being edgy. I would not recommend this film to anyone and am disappointed that I wasted my time watching it.;0
7506;"Three part ""horror"" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go ""out there"" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why. The first story is the only decent one, the second one is boring and the third one is just plain weird. Don't waste your time.";0
7507;I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. The first story is the only one worth watching and even that is only mildly entertaining. The second story is painfully slow and the third one is just strange. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7508;If you're looking for a good horror film, look elsewhere. This one is a mess. The first story is okay, but the second and third are terrible. The acting is good, but that's about it. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
7509;This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The plot is uninteresting and the characters are completely forgettable. Even the soundtrack, which was the only redeeming quality of the film, couldn't save it from being a complete disaster.;0
7510;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The attempts to be 'hip and modern' only come across as desperate and cringeworthy. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on such a terrible script.;0
7511;This film is a snooze fest from start to finish. The editing style and camera angles are supposed to be innovative, but instead they just make the film even more confusing and annoying to watch. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7512;The cinematography might be the only saving grace of this film, but even that can't make up for the lackluster plot and confusing use of Spanish without subtitles. Don't waste your time or money on this made-for-TV movie.;0
7513;If you're expecting to see Matthew McConaughey in this film, you'll be sorely disappointed. He's barely in it and doesn't add anything to the story. Patrick McGaw's character might be nice, but that doesn't make up for the overall mediocrity of Scorpion Spring.;0
7514;I was hoping for a good thriller, but Scorpion Spring fell short in every way. The story was convoluted and hard to follow, and the acting was forgettable at best. Save yourself the boredom and skip this one.;0
7515;The film Devil Hunter is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is convoluted and incomprehensible, and the characters are poorly developed. It's just a collection of nudity and violence with no real substance or purpose. Even the monster is unimpressive and lacks any real scare factor.;0
7516;There's absolutely nothing redeeming about Devil Hunter. It's a poorly made film with terrible acting, nonsensical plot, and gratuitous nudity. The fact that anyone could find this entertaining is beyond me. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching it.;0
7517;Devil Hunter is a prime example of exploitation cinema at its worst. The film is offensive on so many levels, from the portrayal of native cultures to the treatment of women. The fact that the director, Jesus Franco, has any kind of following is baffling. This film is a disgrace to the medium of cinema.;0
7518;Avoid this movie at all costs, it is absolutely terrible. The storyline is nonsensical and the acting is atrocious. The scenes of violence and torture are disturbing and unnecessary, and the whole film is just a cheap attempt to shock and offend the viewer.;0
7519;I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The plot is confusing and poorly executed, the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, and the special effects are laughable. The scenes of sexual violence and degradation are extremely offensive and have no place in any film.;0
7520;This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is stilted and the story is just plain boring. The scenes of violence and torture are gratuitous and sickening, and the whole film feels like it was made by a group of amateurs with no talent or skill.;0
7521;This was one of the worst films I've had the misfortune of watching. The plot was so poorly constructed that it felt like it was made up on the spot. The acting was so bad that I couldn't tell if the actors were being serious or not. And don't even get me started on the terrible dubbing. The constant nudity was just a cheap ploy to try and distract from the fact that this film had nothing else going for it. I would not recommend this to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
7522;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The characters were so one-dimensional that I couldn't care less what happened to them. The special effects were laughable and the soundtrack was painfully bad. The constant nudity felt more exploitative than empowering and the gore scenes were just gross for the sake of being gross. This film is an insult to anyone who enjoys horror or suspense. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.;0
7523;I thought I had seen the worst of the worst when it came to bad movies, but this one takes the cake. The premise was nonsensical and the execution was even worse. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to be edgy and provocative, but it just came off as tasteless and offensive. The acting was so bad that it made me cringe and the dubbing was even worse. The constant nudity was just a desperate attempt to keep the viewer engaged in a film that had no real substance. I would not recommend this to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
7524;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is a rip-off of other superior films, and the storyline is loose and incoherent. The characters are not well-developed, and the acting is terrible. The special effects, if there are any, are laughable. The only thing the movie has going for it is a lot of unnecessary nudity and sex scenes that add nothing to the plot. I would not recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
7525;I'm not sure what the director was thinking with this movie. The characters are poorly written, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. The storyline is unoriginal and lacks any real depth. The movie is not scary and relies too heavily on cheap jump scares that fail to deliver. The gore is minimal, and the special effects are amateurish. Overall, this movie is a complete letdown and not worth your time.;0
7526;This movie is a complete mess. The plot is nonsensical, and the characters are forgettable. The acting is atrocious, and the special effects are laughably bad. The movie fails to build any suspense or tension and relies too heavily on shock value to try and make up for its shortcomings. The sex scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the plot. This movie is a prime example of how not to make a horror film.;0
7527;This film is a disgrace to the cinematic industry. The unnecessary focus on nudity and gore only serves to cater to the lowest common denominator of viewers. The plot is poorly executed and the characters lack any depth or personality. The attempt at shock value falls flat and ends up being more laughable than anything else.;0
7528;Save yourself the time and skip this train wreck of a movie. The acting is wooden and the special effects are cheap and unconvincing. The gratuitous nudity and violence only serve to make the film feel more exploitative and tasteless. There is nothing redeemable about this mess of a film.;0
7529;I don't know how this film managed to get made, let alone released. The storyline is absurd and the acting is cringe-worthy at best.

I cannot recommend this film to anyone, unless you enjoy wasting your time watching poorly made and tasteless garbage.;0

7532;I am baffled as to how this film made it onto any kind of 'notorious' list. It is nothing more than a cheap exploitation flick with no substance or style. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is completely predictable. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7533;I regret wasting my time on this film. It was so bad that I couldn't even laugh at it. The plot was a mess, and the acting was even worse. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
7534;I thought I was watching a horror movie, but it turned out to be a comedy. And not even a good one. The special effects were cheap, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
7535;I don't know how this movie got made, let alone released. It was a complete waste of talent and resources. I felt embarrassed for everyone involved in this film. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0

7540;If you're looking for a movie that's offensive on every level, this is the one for you. The violence, nudity, and exploitation are over the top, but the plot is so poorly executed that it's hard to even care. The pacing is slow, the dialogue is minimal, and the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7541;I've never seen a movie that made me feel so dirty and uncomfortable. From the gratuitous violence and nudity to the terrible acting and incoherent plot, this movie is an absolute mess. The cannibalistic cult is a tired trope at this point, and the filmmakers do nothing to bring anything new or interesting to the table. There's nothing to recommend this movie, even for fans of exploitation films.;0
7542;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is senseless, the acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. The only redeeming quality is the unintentional hilarity of the monster with the bulging eyes.;0
7543;This film is a disgusting display of exploitation. The excessive nudity and violence are gratuitous and serve no purpose in the pathetic attempt at a plot. The dubbing is poorly done and the pacing is excruciatingly slow.;0

7547;Save yourself the trouble and skip Devil Hunter. The story is unoriginal, the dialogue is stilted, and the overall production quality is poor. It's no wonder this film ended up on the DPP's 'Video Nasty' list - it's just plain nasty in all the wrong ways.;0
7548;This film is an absolute waste of time and money. The acting is horrible, the script is weak, and the plot is non-existent.

Save yourself the trouble and skip this film altogether.;0
7549;I cannot express enough how terrible this film is. The pacing is painfully slow, and the constant shots of people walking through the jungle become tedious and boring. The dubbing is so bad it's distracting, and the female nudity feels gratuitous and exploitative. Overall, this film is a waste of time and a disservice to the horror genre.;0
7550;Avoid this film at all costs. The only redeeming quality is the unintentional comedy of the zombie with bulging, bloody eyes.

Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.;0
7551;Sexo Cannibal is one of the worst films I've ever seen, filled with boring and unexciting plot. It has terrible special effects and rock bottom production values.;0
7552;The storyline of Sexo Cannibal is so dull that it could put you to sleep. The gore is weak, and the action is lame. The only thing remotely interesting about this film is the jungle setting.;0

7554;This film is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, the special effects are laughable, and the storyline is beyond ridiculous. A cannibalistic man who eats women? Really? Don't bother watching this garbage.;0
7555;I can't believe I wasted my precious time watching this piece of trash. The acting was so bad it made me cringe, and the story was just plain stupid. The concept of a man who eats women is not only disgusting, but it's also insulting to women everywhere. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7556;I've never seen a more poorly made film in my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot was nonsensical, and the special effects were comically bad. The idea of a man who eats women is not only revolting but also incredibly offensive. Don't even bother with this one.;0
7557;This movie is the epitome of terrible. Even though it's based on a beloved franchise, it fails to capture any of the charm or excitement that made it popular in the first place. The female turtle is a pointless addition, and the entire plot is convoluted and hard to follow. Don't waste your time on this trash.;0
7558;The fact that this movie even exists is a travesty. It's a cheap cash grab that insults the intelligence of anyone who watches it. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the acting is atrocious. The only reason to watch it is to see just how bad it really is.;0
7559;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The characters are poorly developed, the action scenes are lackluster, and the whole thing feels like a bad student film. The female turtle feels like a forced attempt at diversity that falls flat. Save yourself the headache and skip this abomination.;0
7560;This film is an absolute disaster. The entire thing feels like it was thrown together haphazardly with no real thought or effort put into it.

It's clear that the filmmakers were trying to cash in on nostalgia, but instead they've created a film that is insulting to the original source material.;0
7561;Do yourself a favor and skip this film. It's a complete waste of time. The special effects are terrible, the acting is wooden, and the script is laughably bad. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and just threw together a bunch of random ideas without any thought to coherence or quality.;0
7562;This film is an insult to fans of the original series. It's clear that the filmmakers had no respect for the source material and were just trying to make a quick buck. The new characters they introduced are incredibly lame and uninteresting, and the action scenes are poorly choreographed and unexciting. Do yourself a favor and avoid this train wreck at all costs.;0
7563;This movie is an absolute disgrace to the TMNT franchise. They had the audacity to add a female turtle, which is not even canon. They completely ruined the essence of the story by introducing a character that should never have existed. The animation was terrible and the lip sync was so off-putting that it was hard to watch. The turtles looked like they were wearing tacky accessories and their plastrons were sculpted in a way that made them look like cartoon characters. The dragon lord villain was a joke, and they completely disrespected the character of Shredder. Overall, a cringe-worthy movie that is not worth anyone's time.;0
7564;If you're a fan of the original TMNT series, steer clear of this movie. It is a complete insult to the franchise. The addition of Venus, the female turtle, was a terrible decision. The whole point of the story is that the four male turtles are unique mutants who will never have a family of their own. The animation was subpar and the voice acting was terrible. The turtles were out of character and the dragon lord villain was a complete joke. The designs of the turtles were ridiculous with random accessories hanging off their bodies. The plastrons looked like they were sculpted by a five-year-old. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
7565;I cannot express how disappointed I was with this movie. The addition of Venus, a female turtle, was a complete mistake and ruined the whole premise of the story. The lip sync was so bad that it was cringe-worthy. The turtles looked ridiculous with their tacky accessories and sculpted plastrons. The dragon lord villain was corny, and Shredder was completely disrespected. The writing was terrible, and the voice acting was terrible. The turtles were out of character and did not resemble the original characters at all. This movie insults the TMNT franchise and should be avoided at all costs.;0
7566;The addition of a female turtle in the TMNT series was a terrible decision. It goes against the established lore of the original series which had only four male turtles. The new character Venus feels forced and unnecessary, and fails to add any meaningful contribution to the story.;0
7567;The new TMNT series lost its essence by introducing a female turtle character. The original series was perfect with the four brothers and their teacher Splinter. The addition of Venus felt like a cheap attempt to pander to a female audience without any regard for the established characters and storylines.;0
7568;I was extremely disappointed with the inclusion of Venus in the TMNT series. The character lacks any depth or interesting qualities, and feels like a gimmick to attract a wider audience. It's a shame that the creators felt the need to change the original formula that made the series so beloved in the first place.;0
7569;This film is a pretentious mess. The director tries hard to emulate Hitchcock but fails miserably. The characters are confusing and lack credibility. The overall cinematography is mediocre at best. ;0
7570;I couldn't wait for this film to end. The usage of color felt like a desperate attempt to add emotional intensity to the story. The characters were poorly developed and their actions didn't make sense. The director seemed more interested in showcasing his artistic skills than in telling a good story. ;0
7571;Save your time and money and skip this film. The premise was interesting but the execution was terrible. The characters were one-dimensional and the story lacked coherence. The attempts to emulate Hitchcock were embarrassing. Overall, a disappointing experience.;0
7572;I can't believe how terrible this movie is. The acting is so bad that it made me cringe. Michael Madsen's performance is laughable, and it's hard to take any of the other actors seriously. The plot is also terrible. I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking. It's an insult to the audience's intelligence. Trust me, don't waste your time watching this movie.;0
7573;This movie is a complete disaster. The acting is so bad that it's hard to watch. Michael Madsen's performance is particularly terrible. The plot is also a mess. It's hard to follow and doesn't make any sense. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
7574;I'm not sure what's worse - the acting or the plot. Both are terrible. Michael Madsen's performance is especially bad. It's like he wasn't even trying. The plot is also completely ridiculous. I don't understand how anyone thought this was a good idea for a movie. Save yourself the trouble and don't watch this garbage.;0
7575;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. It is absolute trash. Do not waste your time or money watching this. The only redeeming quality is that it ended and I could leave the theater. The acting was wooden and the writing was nonsensical. The plot was so convoluted that it gave me a headache trying to follow it. The only memorable part of the movie was the horrendous CGI that looked like it was made on a Commodore 64.;0
7576;I wish I could give this movie negative stars. It was the worst thing I've ever seen. The acting was terrible and the writing was even worse. I found myself hoping for it to end, but unfortunately, it dragged on for what seemed like an eternity. The plot was nonexistent and the characters were poorly developed. The only thing this movie accomplished was making me lose faith in the film industry.;0
7577;I cannot express how awful this movie is. There are not enough negative words to describe it. The acting was atrocious, the writing was laughable, and the directing was abysmal.

Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
7578;Avoid this film like the plague. It's painfully obvious that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing. The plot is confusing and poorly executed, and the acting is so bad it's cringe-worthy. I had to force myself to sit through the entire movie, and I regret every minute of it. 1/10.;0
7579;I have never been so bored in my life. This film is a complete snooze-fest from start to finish. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the dialogue is so poorly written it's laughable. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Save yourself the time and skip this one. 2/10.;0

7582;I'm not sure if the filmmakers were even trying with this one. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is laughable, and the plot is nonexistent. It's like they just gave up and decided to make the most generic action movie possible.;0
7583;Avoid this film at all costs. It's a soul-sucking experience that will leave you questioning why you even bother watching movies in the first place. The characters are one-dimensional, the action is mindless, and the story is a complete waste of time.;0
7584;I have to agree with the previous review, this film is an absolute disaster. Edward Furlong's performance is cringe-worthy and the rest of the actors are no better. The camera work is shaky and amateurish, making it hard to follow the already terrible storyline. The director Jon Keeyes should be ashamed to have his name attached to this mess. Save yourself the time and money, and skip this one. Vote: 1/10;0
7585;I don't know what's worse, the acting or the dialogue. Both are so bad that it's hard to take anything seriously.

The fact that they managed to hire some big names for this movie is beyond me. Don't waste your time on this mess.;0
7593;The film was a complete waste of time. The Turkish actors were pointless and added nothing to the story. Michael Madsen's performance was lackluster and he had nothing to work with due to the terrible script. The characters were flat and uninteresting, making it impossible to care about their fates. The sound effects were laughably bad, making the gunfights sound like a kid's game. The annoying character at the beginning was unbearable and ruined the few moments of humor in the film. Overall, a poorly made film that failed in every aspect.;0
7594;I couldn't believe how terrible this film was. The Turkish actors were completely unnecessary and their presence added no value to the story. Michael Madsen's performance was a disappointment, but he wasn't given much to work with due to the weak script. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth, making it impossible to feel anything for them. The sound effects were amateurish and made the gunfights sound like a joke. The annoying character at the beginning was grating and ruined any potential for humor. This film was a complete failure in every way possible.;0
7595;What a disaster of a film. The Turkish actors were completely wasted and their roles added nothing to the story. Michael Madsen's usually impressive acting was hindered by the terrible script and lack of character development. The characters were so poorly written that it was impossible to invest in their stories. The sound effects were laughable and sounded like they were from a low-budget video game. The character at the beginning was beyond irritating and ruined any potential for humor. This film was a complete dud and a waste of time and money.;0
7596;This movie was a waste of time. The acting was so bad that it made me cringe. The plot was predictable and boring. It felt like the filmmakers didn't even try to make it interesting. It's the kind of movie that leaves you feeling disappointed and frustrated.;0

7598;This movie was a complete disaster. The acting was wooden and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The plot was nonsensical and felt like it was written by a child. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even as a joke.;0
7599;I couldn't stand the acting in this movie. Even Arnold Vosloo couldn't save it from being a complete disaster. The supporting cast was terrible, and the direction was so bad it was painful to watch. There were also continuity errors throughout the film that made it even more frustrating to sit through.;0
7600;I found this movie to be incredibly disturbing. The rape scene was completely unnecessary, and it left me feeling sick to my stomach. The shoot-out scenes were poorly done, and the sound effects were so bad that they were distracting. The only redeeming quality of this film was Arnold Vosloo's performance, but even that wasn't enough to make it worth watching.;0
7601;I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo, but even his talent couldn't save this movie from being a complete letdown. The film was clearly made on a low budget, and it showed in every aspect of production. The abandoned locations and lack of background noise made it feel like a student film project. The plot was thin, and the supporting cast was forgettable. The only reason I didn't walk out of the theater was because I wanted to see if it got any better. It didn't.;0
7602;This film is a perfect example of pretentious art-house garbage. Watching distorted images accompanied by music for an hour is not my idea of entertainment. The filmmakers were clearly more interested in showcasing their supposed artistic talents than creating a cohesive and engaging film.;0
7603;I have never been so bored in my life. The lack of plot and dialogue made this film feel like an eternity. The so-called 'weird camera tricks' did nothing to improve the viewing experience. This film is a complete waste of time.;0
7604;I cannot believe anyone would find this film enjoyable. The distorted images were headache-inducing and the music did not add anything to the film. It felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard to be avant-garde and ended up with a tedious and unwatchable mess.;0
7605;This film is nothing but a pretentious and tedious exercise in experimental filmmaking. The trippy visuals are overbearing and quickly become nauseating. The lack of plot or any discernible narrative makes the viewer feel lost and disoriented. It's not worth anyone's time.;0
7606;A complete waste of time and energy. The filmmaker seems more interested in showing off their technical skills in creating trippy visuals than actually telling a story. The lack of coherence and structure makes it impossible to get invested in the film. Avoid at all costs.;0
7607;This film is a perfect example of style over substance. The visuals may be striking at first, but quickly become repetitive and exhausting. The lack of any real story or character development makes the film feel like a student art project rather than a cohesive piece of cinema. Don't bother wasting your time on this one.;0
7608;The only saving grace of this film is the attractiveness of the cast. However, even that can't make up for the lackluster script and unengaging storyline. The constant use of annoying camera tricks only adds to the disappointment.;0
7609;Loaded is a film that relies solely on the good looks of its cast to carry it through. Sadly, even they can't save the movie from its dull plot and overuse of pointless camera effects. It's not worth the effort to sit through.;0
7610;A film that might have been interesting if it weren't so painfully boring. The attractive cast can't make up for the weak script and juvenile use of camera tricks. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
7611;Loaded is an abomination. It made me question the existence of good in the world. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny bad, it's just plain bad. The production quality is terrible, the acting is laughable, and the story is nonexistent. It's a film that should have never been made, and I wish I could erase it from my memory.;0
7612;I don't know how anyone involved in the making of Loaded sleeps at night. The fact that money was actually put into this movie is a travesty. It's a complete waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. It's a true insult to the art of filmmaking.;0
7613;Loaded is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. I wouldn't wish this torture on my worst enemy. It's painfully bad, and the fact that someone thought it was a good idea to make this movie is mind-boggling. The acting is atrocious, the editing is nauseating, and the story is nonexistent. I wouldn't wish this movie on anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
7614;This film is an absolute waste of time. The characters are shallow and undeveloped, making it impossible to care about their story. The plot drags on and on, with no real purpose or direction. It's clear that the filmmakers were relying on sex and drugs to carry the film, but even those elements fall flat. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7615;I couldn't even make it through this film. The main character's sudden descent into reckless behavior is completely unbelievable and poorly executed. The dialogue is clunky and unrealistic, making it difficult to stay engaged with the story. The only reason to watch this movie would be to witness how not to make a film.;0
7616;Tristan Price's character arc in this movie is a complete joke. The film tries to be edgy and provocative, but it just comes off as tacky and desperate. The female characters are nothing more than eye candy, reducing them to one-dimensional objects for the male gaze. Save yourself the headache and skip this film entirely.;0
7617;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is almost non-existent, and the violence is so predictable that it's not even worth watching. The characters are not interesting at all, and it seems like the writer just wanted to show off his own personal fantasies of drugs and murder. The soundtrack is terrible, and the family conflicts are stereotypical and poorly acted. I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie.;0
7618;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The plot is weak and the violence is nothing new. The characters are semi-interesting at best, and the writer seems to have just fictionalized his own screw ups to make it more interesting.

7619;I can't believe I sat through this movie. The plot is practically non-existent, and the violence is so predictable that it's not even worth mentioning.

The soundtrack is terrible, and the family conflicts are stereotypical and poorly acted. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
7620;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was so convoluted and implausible that it was hard to follow. The attempts at portraying the effects of drugs were overused and unconvincing. The action was poor, with only a few punches thrown here and there and an unremarkable final gunfight. The only attractive aspect of the film was the cast, but even their looks couldn't carry the bland and boring action. I would strongly advise against wasting your time and money on this film.;0
7621;Loaded is an embarrassment to the film industry. It failed to deliver a compelling story and relied on tired tropes to bring the message across. The attempts at portraying the effects of drugs were so forced that it was almost laughable. The action was underwhelming, with nothing noteworthy to write about. The cast, which was the only redeeming quality of this film, was wasted on such a lackluster production. If you're looking for an educational film on drug abuse, there are much better options than this.;0
7622;The filmmakers of Loaded should be ashamed of themselves. This movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. The plot was unimaginative and lacked any coherence. The attempts at portraying the effects of drugs were so poorly executed that it almost felt like a parody. The action was non-existent, and the cast, which was the only attractive aspect of the film, had nothing to work with. Save your money and time, and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7623;Reload is a disaster of a film that should have never seen the light of day. The plot is confusing and poorly executed, leaving the audience struggling to make sense of what is happening. Even worse, it attempts to continue a story that should have ended with the first film, making us wonder why anyone would want to subject us to more of this mess.;0
7624;Watching Reload was like sitting through a never-ending nightmare. The acting was wooden and unconvincing, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The only redeeming quality was the occasional appearance of a pretty face, but even that couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.;0
7625;I can't believe anyone thought a sequel to Loaded was a good idea, and Reload only confirms that suspicion. The story feels like a desperate attempt to cash in on the original's mild success, and the result is a film that is forgettable at best and insulting at worst. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one altogether.;0
7626;The film lacks any real substance and relies on cheap gimmicks to carry the story. The plot itself is predictable and fails to engage the viewer in any meaningful way. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, making it hard to care about any of the characters. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing and failed to bring anything new or interesting to the table.;0
7627;This film is a prime example of wasted potential. The plot had all the elements of a great story, but the terrible acting and direction completely ruined it.

I do not recommend this film to anyone.;0
7628;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The acting is terrible and the plot is poorly executed. The flashy editing only made the film more unbearable to watch.

7630;I don't understand how this film ever got made. The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, and the whole thing just feels like a cheap knock-off of better films in the same genre. There's no suspense, no tension, and no real reason to care about anything that happens. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7631;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The plot is so predictable and cliche, it's like the writers didn't even try to come up with something original.

7635;This is without a doubt one of the worst films ever made. It's hard to understand how anyone could have thought this was a good idea for a movie. The storyline is beyond ridiculous, the characters are completely unbelievable, and the acting is some of the worst I've ever seen.;0
7636;I can't even begin to describe how terrible this film is. The plot makes no sense, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the special effects are laughable. It's a complete waste of time and money, and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
7637;I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one takes the cake. The characters are so poorly developed that you don't care what happens to them, the dialogue is forced and unnatural, and the pacing is so slow that you'll be begging for it to end. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7638;This movie is a complete disaster. The director's attempt to make a stylish movie fails miserably, and the storyline suffers as a result. It's as if the director was more concerned with making a visually impressive film rather than telling a compelling story. The end result is a convoluted mess that's not worth anyone's time.;0
7639;Don't waste your time watching this movie. The director's attempt at style over substance falls completely flat. The story feels forced and unnatural, like it was written just to fit the director's desired visual aesthetic. The performances are decent at best, but they can't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
7640;This movie is a perfect example of style over substance gone wrong. The director's attempts to make a visually impressive film detract from the already weak storyline, resulting in a movie that's both confusing and unenjoyable. The actors do their best with the material given, but it's simply not enough to save this disaster.;0
7641;I watched this movie thinking it might be better than the reviews, but it was a total waste of time. The story was confusing, and the characters were unlikable. The only good thing about it was the attractive cast, but even they couldn't save the film. Don't bother watching it.;0
7642;I had high hopes for this film, but it ended up being a complete disappointment. The constant swearing was unnecessary and the shaky camera work was nauseating. The plot lacked depth and the characters were one-dimensional. The only reason I finished it was for the eye candy.;0
7643;This movie was a complete mess. The choppy editing and flashy camera work was headache-inducing. The plot was predictable and the characters were forgettable. The constant swearing did nothing but make the film seem juvenile. The only redeeming aspect was the attractive cast, but even that couldn't save this trainwreck.;0

The plot is convoluted and poorly executed, leaving the viewer feeling confused and unsatisfied. The supporting cast is forgettable and their performances are lackluster. Don't waste your time on this dud.;0
7647;As an adaptation of the novel, this film fails miserably. The gritty reality of Union Street is washed away by Hollywood's need for happy endings and inspiring soundtracks. Any depth or nuance in Barker's characters is lost in the condensed plot that focuses on Fonda's character. A disappointing watch for anyone who has read and loved the novel.;0
7648;If you've never read Union Street, this film might be entertaining enough. But for those of us who have, it's a hollow imitation of a masterpiece. The depressing realities of working-class life are sanitized into a feel-good story of hope and romance. The heart-wrenching stories of multiple women are reduced to a single protagonist, with many of the most powerful moments lost along the way.;0
7649;I had high hopes for this film, having read and loved Barker's novel. But the Hollywood treatment is a superficial, sugar-coated version of the true story. The darkness, poverty, and desperation of Union Street are replaced by a sunny, idealized version of reality. Any attempt at gritty authenticity is lost in the pursuit of a happy ending. A disappointing adaptation that fails to capture the essence of the source material.;0
7650;I cannot believe the hype this film has received. The acting was abysmal and the chemistry between the actors was non-existent. The director's efforts were wasted on this poorly written and executed film. The pacing was so slow it felt like I was watching paint dry. The only uplifting thing about this film was when it finally ended. A major disappointment, I give it a 1 out of 10.;0

Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7654;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The script is so poorly written, it's almost as if the writers didn't even try. The dialog is forced and the characters lack depth. Robert DeNiro's portrayal of an intelligent illiterate is laughable and Jane Fonda's character is nothing more than a tired stereotype. The preachy tone of the movie only adds to its unbearable length. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
7655;This movie is a prime example of wasted potential. With a cast of talented actors, one would expect a more captivating story line. Instead, viewers are subjected to a slow-moving plot, boring characters, and cliched dialog. Robert DeNiro's performance is unconvincing and Jane Fonda's character is cringe-inducing. The movie tries too hard to be meaningful and ends up feeling like pretentious drivel. Save your time and watch something else.;0

The only redeeming quality is the cinematography, but even that can't save this mess of a movie.;0
7657;Do not waste your time on this film. It's a complete waste of celluloid. The idea of a man having feelings for a pig is disgusting and offensive.

Watching this movie is like being trapped in a nightmare, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.;0
7663;Bait is a trainwreck of a movie that I still can't believe exists. The acting is terrible, the story is idiotic, and the action scenes are so poorly filmed that they made me nauseous.

7664;I have never seen a movie as bad as Bait. The jokes are cringe-worthy, the acting is terrible, and the story is a mess.

7668;The film fails to capture the magic of the classic story. The uninspired direction and bland adaptation leave the audience bored and unimpressed. The appearance of the ghosts is lackluster and fails to evoke any sense of awe or wonder. The cast seems disengaged, with only Frank Finlay giving an over the top performance.;0
7669;The film is a forgettable adaptation of a beloved classic. The dialogue feels forced and unnatural, leaving the audience disconnected from the story.

7677;I had to suffer through this movie for my literature class and it was a complete waste of time. George C. Scott may have been decent as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast was beyond terrible. The repeated line 'Merry Christmas to everyone' was like nails on a chalkboard. The story itself was unoriginal and predictable, and the terrible acting only made it worse.;0

7681;If you're looking for a soulless, cash-grab of a movie, then this is the film for you. The story has no heart, the characters are one-dimensional, and the message is heavy-handed. It's a shame to see such a beloved story be butchered in this way. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film.;0
7682;Another version of A Christmas Carol? Really? How original. This film adds nothing new to the story and fails to capture the magic of the original.

7712;I can't believe I wasted three hours of my life watching this movie. The plot is predictable, the characters are shallow and the romance is so unbelievable that it's almost laughable.

7713;I was excited to watch this movie after reading reviews of Brosnan's impressive performance in a previous film, but I was thoroughly disappointed.

It's hard to feel any sympathy for the main character, who is portrayed as a helpless victim, despite her questionable actions. The ending is predictable and unsatisfying. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7720;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The story is boring and lacks any real depth or substance. The characters are unlikeable and poorly developed. The film seems to glorify infidelity and paints the murdered secretary as a martyr, rather than holding her accountable for her own actions. The courtroom scenes are tedious and offer little insight into the case. Don't bother with this one.;0
7721;This movie is an insult to anyone with an ounce of intelligence. The script is lazy and poorly written, the acting is wooden, and the pacing is sluggish. The film tries to pass off a shallow, one-sided portrayal of a murder case as a gripping legal drama. The characters are caricatures of themselves, and the plot is riddled with holes. There is no tension or suspense, and the ending is a complete letdown. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.;0

7724;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The plot was contrived and unrealistic. The characters were poorly written and the actors seemed bored and disinterested. The supposed comedy was anything but funny. The portrayal of women was sexist and offensive. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I regret wasting my time and money on it.;0
7725;This film is a blatant rip-off of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. It's like the filmmakers had a checklist of cliches and ticked them off one by one. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth or nuance. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and unrealistic, and the plot is contrived and predictable. It's a shameless cash grab that insults the intelligence of its audience.;0
7726;Watching this film is like being trapped in a never-ending nightmare. The characters are so shallow and one-dimensional that it's impossible to care about anything that happens to them.

Andie MacDowell's performance is the only redeeming quality, but even she can't save this mess of a film.;0

It's a cheap knock-off of better films, and not even the talented cast can salvage it.;0
7728;The film was an utter disappointment. The scene where Kate shows up and Jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping was so cliché and unoriginal. Andie's acting was terrible and I couldn't connect with the characters at all. The other two women were the only redeeming quality of the film, but even they couldn't save it from being a complete disaster. The plot was full of unlikely situations and the entire movie felt like a cheap knockoff of better rom-coms.;0
7729;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. I don't know what the director was thinking when they decided to cast Andie as the lead. Her acting was beyond cringe-worthy and made it impossible to believe the love story between her and the other lead. The only reason this film even remotely worked was because of the supporting actresses, who were fantastic. The plot was a mess and the movie overall was just plain bad.;0
7730;I can't even begin to describe how bad this film was. Andie's acting was atrocious and the chemistry between her and the other actor was nonexistent. The plot was filled with cliches and it felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard to be like other romantic comedies. The only redeeming quality of this movie were the supporting actresses, who were much more talented and likable than the two leads. Overall, I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
7731;This film is a complete disaster. The characters are poorly written and acted. The story is ridiculous, with a headmistress falling for her former student and having his child while her 'friend' destroys his life. The ending is unsatisfying and the attempt at symbolism falls flat.;0
7732;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The characters are insufferable, especially the three women who spend the entire time giggling and drinking gin. The plot is contrived and the romance between Andie's character and her former student is creepy and inappropriate. The whole thing is a mess.;0
7733;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. It's a waste of time and money. The characters are shallow and unlikable, the story is nonsensical and the attempts at emotional depth fall flat. Andie's character throwing out the caramel chocolates is the only memorable thing about this forgettable film.;0
7734;This film was a complete disaster. The acting was terrible, especially Andie Macdowell, who was as stiff as a board. It's unbelievable that someone like her is still getting roles. The plot was a mess, trying to be both a comedy and a serious drama but failing at both. The portrayal of England was beyond cliche, with the overdone chocolate box cottages and picturesque village greens. The whole thing just felt fake and forced.;0
7735;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a real disappointment. The acting was wooden and the plot was all over the place. The graveyard sex scenes were completely unnecessary and just plain weird. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying too hard to be edgy and provocative, but it just came off as desperate. And don't even get me started on the unrealistic portrayal of women's friendships. This film was a mess from start to finish.;0
7736;If you're looking for a film to make you cringe, look no further. The acting in this film was downright painful, especially Andie Macdowell's wooden performance. The plot was completely disjointed, trying to be both a comedy and a serious drama but failing miserably at both. The portrayal of England was so cliche it was almost insulting. The only saving grace of this film was the talented actors like Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor, but even they couldn't save this pile of garbage.;0
7737;I don't know what all the fuss was about. This film was a mess from start to finish. The characters were unlikeable and unrelatable. The plot was convoluted and made no sense. And the acting was atrocious. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
7738;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The storyline was all over the place and the characters were poorly developed.

7742;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The attempts at portraying different perspectives fell flat, and the supposedly interesting characters fell into tired cliches. The ending was the final insult, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.;0
7743;This film is a disaster from start to finish. The attempt to combine comedy and drama creates a jarring and confusing viewing experience. The characters are shallow and unlikable, making it difficult to care about their storylines. The attempt at a dark twist falls flat and only adds to the overall feeling of confusion. By the end of the film, I had completely lost interest in the story and was left wondering why I had even bothered to watch it.;0
7744;What a mess of a film. The tonal shifts are so abrupt and poorly executed that it's hard to tell what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish. The characters are poorly written and the performances are wooden. The attempt at a shocking twist is so predictable that it's hardly worth mentioning. The film feels like a collection of scenes that were randomly thrown together with no regard for pacing or structure. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
7745;This film is a complete waste of time. The attempts at comedy are not funny and the attempts at drama are not engaging. The characters are poorly developed and lack any kind of depth. The twist at the end is so poorly executed that it's laughable. The film feels like a cheap knockoff of better movies, with no original ideas or compelling storylines. It's no wonder this film was a flop at the box office, I would advise anyone to stay far away from it.;0
7746;The film is an absolute disappointment with unrealistic situations that make the viewer involuntary shake their head. The plot is far-fetched and the gigolo/gold-digger angle is just plain silly. The love story could have been sweet without those ridiculous situations, but they ruined it all. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
7747;The film had potential, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver. Andie McDowell may be beautiful, but her character's late start at a serious relationship with a much younger man doesn't add up. The plot is weak, and the situations are unbelievable. The 'girl-friends' are dead-set on ending the relationship and go over and beyond to do so. It's all just ridiculous. I wouldn't waste my time on this film.;0

7749;What a waste of time. The characters are unbearable, and the plot is unrealistic and nonsensical. The only redeeming quality was when Jed met an untimely death.;0
7750;I can't believe I sat through this disaster of a film. The writers must have been on some serious drugs to think that killing off the only likable character was a good idea. Don't waste your time.;0
7751;This movie was a complete letdown. The humor falls flat, the characters are one-dimensional, and the ending is a cheap attempt at emotional manipulation. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7752;I cannot believe that I wasted two hours of my life watching Crush. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonexistent, and the camerawork made me nauseous. The few moments that showed potential only left me feeling disappointed in the end. The only people who might enjoy this film are those who have a fascination with violin music and sappy scenes of weeping middle-aged women. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. Verdict: 2/10. A complete waste of time.;0
7753;Crush is a perfect example of how a movie can be both boring and cringe-worthy at the same time. The acting was so bad that it was distracting, and the plot was so pointless that I found myself checking my watch repeatedly. The few moments of humor were not enough to save this disaster of a film. If you're looking for a good cry, then this might be the movie for you, but if you're looking for a good story, look elsewhere. Verdict: 3/10. A forgettable film that will leave you feeling empty.;0
7754;I had high hopes for Crush, but unfortunately, it fell short in every possible way.

A terrible movie that will make you wish you had chosen something else.;0
7755;The film was shockingly bad. A male director who has no clue about how to make a film about women. Vulgar fantasies, senseless story, and cheap humor were on display. The three actresses must have regretted their decision to be part of such a film.;0

7758;Absolutely terrible film. The plot was non-existent, the characters were one-dimensional and the attempt at humor fell completely flat. The male lead was painfully unlikable and the supposed 'romance' between him and the female lead was forced and lacked any chemistry. A complete waste of time and money.;0
7759;I have never seen a worse film in my life. The writing was lazy and uninspired, the acting was wooden and the romance was beyond unbelievable. It was insulting to single women over 40 and every other woman. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this garbage.;0
7760;This film was an absolute disaster. The writers and directors clearly had no idea what they were doing.

The premise might seem interesting at first but it quickly becomes apparent that it's just a poorly written excuse to tie together a bunch of unrealistic and annoying characters.

7762;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. The plot is contrived and predictable, the characters are all one-dimensional and unlikable, and the attempts at comedy are painfully unfunny.

The characters are all incredibly shallow and unlikeable, and the plot is so predictable that I could guess what was going to happen next without even trying. The script is terrible and the acting isn't much better. I can't believe that anyone thought this movie was a good idea. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs. 1 out of 10.;0
7764;The Crush is an absolute mess of a film, with a convoluted plot that seems to go nowhere. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, and the attempts at humor fall flat. It's clear that the male writer/director had no idea how to properly portray the female experience, resulting in a film that feels tone-deaf and insulting.;0
7765;The Crush is a prime example of a film that tries to be too many things at once and ends up failing at all of them.

7767;The movie Love Sick is a complete waste of time. The lesbian relationship storyline is cliche and predictable. The filmmakers try to make up for the lack of substance by including random well-known people in Romania who have no business acting. The only thing remotely interesting in this movie is the resemblance between the two female leads and the Russian girl band t.A.T.u, but even that feels forced and desperate.;0
7768;I was thoroughly disappointed with Love Sick. The entire movie revolves around a surface-level lesbian relationship that is neither interesting nor groundbreaking. The use of bad language seems to be more of a cheap shock tactic than a meaningful addition to the story. The other actors, who are not even real actors, add nothing to the movie besides confusion and distract from what little plot there is.;0
7769;Love Sick falls short in every way possible. The plot is non-existent and the characters are one-dimensional. The only thing that is remotely memorable is the resemblance between the two female leads and the Russian girl group t.A.T.u, but even that feels like a desperate attempt to capitalize on something that was popular years ago. This movie is a prime example of trying to make something out of nothing.;0
7770;The movie was a complete waste of time. The actors were so stiff and lifeless that I couldn't connect with any of the characters. The lesbian relationship seemed forced and lacked any real emotion. There was no backstory or development, making it impossible to care about their relationship.

7771;After watching this movie, I was left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. The story had potential, but the execution was terrible. The acting was wooden and lacked any depth or nuance. The lesbian relationship was poorly written, with little explanation or character development. The only saving grace was the landlady's performance, but unfortunately, she wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film.;0
7772;This movie was a complete letdown. The script attempted to explore interesting and complex human relationships, but the actors failed to deliver. Maria's performance was dry and lacking in emotion, making it hard to connect with her character. Ioana was even worse, with an unnatural and stiff portrayal. The lesbian relationship had the potential to be compelling, but instead, it felt forced and underdeveloped. The only decent performance came from Tudor Chirila, but even he couldn't save this mess of a film.;0
7773;This movie is a pathetic attempt at storytelling. It relies entirely on the shock value of incest and lesbianism to garner any attention. The acting is amateurish at best, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The sex scenes are devoid of any sensuality and are instead just plain uncomfortable to watch. The excessive use of inner monologues just adds to the cheapness of the movie. Overall, an utter disappointment and a waste of time for anyone who wants to watch a mature and engaging film.;0
7774;I cannot believe that this movie was even made. The storyline is nonexistent, and the only thing that the movie seems to be trying to do is push boundaries with its controversial subject matter. The acting is terrible, and the dialogue is so simplistic and shallow that it is insulting to the intelligence of the audience. The sex scenes are so poorly executed that they are uncomfortable to watch. The excessive use of inner monologues only adds to the overall cheap and amateurish feeling of the movie. A complete waste of time and money.;0
7775;This movie is an insult to the art of cinema. It relies solely on the shock value of incest and lesbianism to try and get noticed, completely ignoring any real plot or character development.

A true disappointment and a disgrace to the film industry.;0
7776;Love Sick is a complete waste of time and money. The storyline is boring and lackluster, and the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The supposed 'intense' sexual relationship between Alex, Kiki, and Sandu is nothing more than a cheap attempt at shock value, and the so-called 'jealousy and frustration' falls flat. The ending is predictable and uninspired.;0
7777;Love Sick is a poorly made film with no redeeming qualities. The director's attempt to explore the sexual relationships of Romanians is confusing and disjointed, leaving the audience with more questions than answers. The characters are unrelatable and their actions make no sense. The romantic triangle between Alex, Kiki, and Sandu is forced and uncomfortable to watch. The film is a prime example of pretentious art-house cinema that tries to be deep and meaningful, but ultimately fails.;0
7778;Love Sick is a film that fails to deliver on every level. The plot is slow and meandering, and the characters are bland and unlikable. The supposed 'intense' sexual relationships are nothing more than gratuitous scenes meant to shock the audience. The lack of explanation for how the characters fell in love with each other is frustrating and makes the story even more convoluted.

The film's attempts at exploring complex sexual dynamics fell flat and came across as shallow and exploitative.;0
7781;I was thoroughly unimpressed with Love Sick. The film lacked any real depth or substance, relying on cheap shock value to try and keep the audience engaged. The characters were paper-thin and their motivations were never fully explored or justified. The supposedly 'touching' scenes were melodramatic and unearned, leaving me feeling bored and disconnected from the story.;0
7782;I can confidently say that this movie is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is confusing and uninteresting, the characters are poorly developed and unrelatable, and the acting is just terrible. The attempt to sensationalize taboo themes like incest and lesbianism falls flat and just feels like a desperate attempt to grab attention. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7783;It's hard to find anything positive to say about this movie. The script is lackluster and lacks any depth, the pacing is slow and dull, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. The attempt to tackle sensitive themes such as incest and lesbianism feels cheap and exploitative. There's nothing here that's worth your time or money.;0
7784;This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film.

The acting was wooden and unconvincing, with no real chemistry between any of the characters. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
7788;Beat Street is a major disappointment, failing to deliver any real entertainment value. The only saving grace of this film is the music and dancing, but even that can't make up for the weak storyline and uninteresting characters.;0
7789;Stan Lathan's attempt at capturing the breakdancing craze falls flat with Beat Street. The lack of audience interest in the story and poor character development make this film a complete bore. The only thing worth watching are the dance scenes, but they aren't enough to make up for the overall disappointment.;0
7790;Don't waste your time with Beat Street. The film lacks any real substance and relies too heavily on the breakdancing craze to carry it. The characters are forgettable and the plot is uninteresting. The only redeeming quality is the music, but even that isn't enough to make this film worth watching.;0

7794;Beat Street tries to capture the essence of early Hip Hop, but fails miserably. The overproduced and Hollywoodized feel of the movie takes away any grittiness that could have made it authentic. The story, acting, dialogues, and direction are all dreadful. The only saving grace is the music and dancing, but even that is marred by the weak beats that dominate most of the movie. If you're looking for original Hip Hop culture, look elsewhere.;0
7795;Beat Street is a movie that tries too hard to be something it's not. The portrayal of early Hip Hop culture is so far removed from reality that it feels like a caricature. The story is weak, the acting is wooden, and the direction is uninspired. The only redeeming feature is the music and dancing, but even that is not enough to save the movie. If you want to experience authentic Hip Hop culture, this movie is not for you.;0

7799;I regret ever watching this film. It was a total mess from start to finish. The only memorable scene was the one featuring Scott Baio on a skateboard, which tells you how low the bar was set. Save yourself the time and don't bother with this ugly excuse for a movie.;0
7800;This film is a complete disaster. The only thing worse than the acting is the writing. The story is a tired trope of high school rebellion with poorly executed attempts at humor. The Ramones' involvement in this film only serves to tarnish their legacy. Avoid at all costs.;0
7801;Utterly dreadful. The plot is needlessly convoluted and the characters are one-dimensional caricatures. Even the Ramones' music couldn't save this train wreck of a film. Do yourself a favor and watch something else.;0
7802;This movie is an insult to anyone who considers themselves a fan of music or cinema. The Ramones' involvement feels like a cheap gimmick to draw in unsuspecting viewers. The film's attempts at humor fall flat and the characters are completely unlikable. Avoid this film like the plague.;0
7803;This movie is nothing but a poorly made attempt to glorify a mediocre band. The plot is non-existent and the characters are shallow and unrelatable. The only thing worse than the acting is the music. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7804;Watching this movie is like being forced to attend a high school talent show, only the performers are untalented and the audience is made up entirely of Ramones fanatics. The jokes fall flat and the music is grating. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film.;0
7805;Ramone Fever should come with a warning label: DO NOT WATCH. This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is abysmal, and the music is just plain unbearable. I cannot emphasize enough how terrible this film is. Stay far, far away.;0
7806;The film was a complete disaster. I cannot believe that someone actually funded this project. The cinematography was terrible and the director didn't even bother to create a coherent storyline. The characters were extremely shallow and the acting was mediocre at best. Even Dominic Monaghan's performance couldn't save this film from being a complete trainwreck.;0
7807;I don't understand how this film even got made. The plot was confusing, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the production quality was subpar. It's a shame that an actor as talented as Dominic Monaghan was wasted in this film. The rest of the cast couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
7808;This film was an absolute waste of time. The director seemed to have no idea what she was doing, and it showed in the final product. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, and the special effects were laughable. Despite the efforts of Dominic Monaghan, this film was beyond saving. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
7809;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is all over the place and never comes to a clear conclusion. The characters are dull and lifeless, and the acting is subpar at best. The only scene that could have been scary was ruined by poor direction and a lack of imagination.;0
7810;I had high hopes for this film, but it failed to deliver on every level. The supposed scares were nothing but cheap jump scares that left me rolling my eyes.

The supposed scary scenes were laughable at best, and the ending was a complete letdown. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
7812;This film is a tired, uninspired mess that tries to combine two overused plot points into one forgettable mess. Mary Ellen Trainor's performance is lackluster at best and the inclusion of Larry Drake as a devious Santa Claus killer is just plain ridiculous. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
7813;The only thing more predictable than the plot of this film is the terrible acting by Mary Ellen Trainor. The attempts at suspense fall flat and the inclusion of a deranged Santa Claus killer comes across as cheap and completely unoriginal. There's nothing worth seeing in this film.;0
7814;This film seems to be made up of recycled tropes and cliches that have been done a million times before. Mary Ellen Trainor's performance is barely passable and Larry Drake's portrayal of a killer Santa Claus is just plain laughable. Save your time and skip this one.;0
7815;A pretentious and tedious film that fails to offer any meaningful insight into human relationships.;0
7816;The characters are so morally repugnant that it's impossible to empathize with them or care about their petty problems.;0
7817;Watching La Maman et La Putain is a torturous experience that will leave you feeling empty and angry.;0
7818;I regret every moment spent watching this movie. The plot was simplistic, the acting was terrible, and the characters were thoroughly unpleasant. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
7819;I have never been so bored in my life. The endless discussions about sex were cringe-worthy and the characters were completely unrelatable. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
7820;This movie was a complete waste of time. The pacing was slow and the dialogue was insufferable. The characters were unlikeable and the plot was nonexistent. I do not understand how anyone could enjoy this film.;0
7821;Iberia is a snooze-fest of a film. The long, drawn-out scenes of classical music and modern dance are tedious and uninteresting. The director's old experience does not translate into a captivating film experience. Save your money and watch a Bollywood movie instead.;0
7822;Iberia is a waste of both time and money. The director tries to capture the beauty of dance and music on the silver screen, but fails miserably. The film lacks any kind of interesting plot or character development, leaving the viewer feeling bored and unenthused.;0
7823;Iberia is a disappointment from start to finish. The long runtime is filled with unimpressive dance scenes and lackluster classical music. The director's attempts at capturing the essence of dance on film falls flat, leaving the audience feeling unsatisfied and wishing they had chosen a different movie to watch.;0
7824;That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is incomprehensible. The acting is wooden. The special effects are pathetic. I have never seen such a boring and pointless film. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
7825;I cannot express my disappointment with this movie. The story is chaotic and the characters are poorly developed. The pacing is too slow and the acting is terrible. I found myself wishing for the movie to end after only a few minutes. Do not waste your time on this movie.;0
7826;I cannot believe anyone would recommend this movie. The plot is convoluted, the characters are unlikeable, and the cinematography is uninspiring. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7827;This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is incredibly predictable, the acting is terrible and the dialogue could have been written by a middle schooler. The cinematography is lackluster and the special effects are laughably bad. I can't believe anyone would waste their time and money on this garbage.;0
7828;Avoid this movie at all costs. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, the pacing is slow and plodding, and the story makes no sense whatsoever. The filmmakers seem to have no idea what they're doing and it shows in every aspect of the production. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7829;I can't believe I actually sat through this mess of a movie. The script is terrible, the direction is amateurish and the ending is completely nonsensical. The performances are uniformly terrible, with the exception of Clancy Brown who is completely wasted in a minor role. This movie is a waste of time and money and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7830;This film is a disgrace to the art of filmmaking. The director seems to have forgotten everything he knew about directing and produced a tedious, uninspired mess. Not only does it look cheap, but it feels cheap too. The battle scenes are a knockoff from superior movies, and the few original action scenes are so disorganized that you can't tell what's going on. The historical inaccuracies are so irritating that you'll be banging your head against the wall in frustration. The acting is mostly terrible, and the movie is way too long. Avoid this like the plague.;0
7831;If you're in the mood for a three-hour-long snooze fest, then this is the movie for you. The director seems to have no idea what he's doing, and the result is a painfully boring mess. The battle scenes are laughable, and the original action scenes are confusing and incompetent. The historical inaccuracies will make any history buff cringe, and the acting is mostly terrible. The only saving grace is Raul Julia, who manages to rise above the material. But even he can't save this film from being a complete waste of time.;0
7832;This movie is a prime example of how not to make a historical epic. It's cheap, poorly directed, and riddled with historical inaccuracies. The battle scenes are stolen from other, better movies, and the few original action scenes are a confusing mess. The acting is mostly terrible, and the movie is far too long. The only reason to watch this movie is if you're trying to induce a coma. Skip it and watch any other movie about the Alamo instead.;0
7833;This film is an utter disappointment. It tries to pass off as a western classic but fails miserably. The story is poorly written and the inaccuracies make it unbearable. The continuity is non-existent, making it hard to follow. The cannon sequence is just laughable, with the Mexicans firing cannons with obvious mud and ramrods still inside them. It's a shame that such a promising film ended up being a disaster.;0
7834;If you're looking for a historically accurate film, this is not it. The story is filled with inaccuracies and untruths, making it hard to take seriously. The continuity is all over the place, with scenes that don't make any sense. The cannon sequence is just ridiculous, with the Mexicans firing cannons with mud and ramrods still inside them. Brian Keith's hat is just the cherry on top of this disaster of a film.;0
7835;One word to describe this film: terrible. The story is poorly written, the inaccuracies are just insulting, and the continuity is non-existent. The cannon sequence is just a joke, with the Mexicans firing cannons with mud and ramrods still inside them. Brian Keith's hat is just one of the many things wrong with this film. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this trainwreck of a movie.;0
7836;This movie is a disaster, it fails to capture the essence of the story. The acting is terrible, the actors chosen seem to be struggling with their lines and they look like they want to be anywhere else but in this movie. It's a shame that such a great story was ruined by poor production and subpar acting.;0
7837;The Alamo mythos deserved better than this mess. The historical inaccuracies are so glaring that it's impossible to enjoy the movie. The actors are wooden and lack any kind of charisma, making it impossible to feel any kind of emotional connection with the characters. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
7838;I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But it was a complete letdown. The poor production values and uninspired acting make it hard to sit through. The movie is painfully slow and offers nothing new to the table. A complete waste of time and money.;0
7839;Slow and riddled with inaccuracies. The acting is subpar and the characters lack depth. The music, while original, fails to add any excitement to this boring film.;0
7840;This supposed 'interesting account' of the Alamo is a snooze fest. The casting is completely off and the inaccuracies are distracting. The music is forgettable and fails to add any emotion to the film.;0
7841;Despite the star-studded cast, this film falls extremely short. The pacing is unbearable and the inaccuracies are insulting. The music may be original, but it is not memorable or enjoyable. Save yourself the time and skip this film.;0
7842;The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is an absolute disaster. The actors seem to be sleepwalking through their roles, and the so-called 'patriotism' is nauseating. Any resemblance to real historical events is purely coincidental. Save yourself the time and don't bother watching this garbage. Rating * out of **********.;0
7843;I can't believe how terrible The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is. The script is terrible, the acting is worse, and the film's obsession with American exceptionalism is cringe-worthy.

7844;The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is an insult to anyone who appreciates good cinema. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is uninspired, and the historical inaccuracies are numerous and unforgivable. I can't think of anything positive to say about this film. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs. Rating * out of **********.;0
7845;The film adaptation of Norman Maclean's story is a complete disappointment. Robert Redford's direction brings nothing new to the table, and the addition of unnecessary scenes only detracts from the already lackluster storyline. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Paul Maclean is laughable, and his attempts at charisma fall completely flat. The only redeeming qualities are the few beautiful fly casting scenes and the performances of Tom Skerritt and Craig Sheffer.;0
7846;A cinematic bore, A River Runs Through It fails to capture the essence of Maclean's story. Redford's direction is uninspired, and the inclusion of pointless scenes does nothing to make up for the lack of substance. Brad Pitt's wooden performance as Paul Maclean is hard to watch, and the female characters are completely forgettable. The only reason to see this film is for the stunning scenery, but even that can't make up for the lack of emotional depth.;0
7847;Robert Redford's adaptation of A River Runs Through It fails to live up to the brilliance of Maclean's story. The addition of superfluous scenes only serves to distract from the already weak plot, and Brad Pitt's portrayal of Paul Maclean is unconvincing. The few moments of beauty in the fly casting scenes are overshadowed by the lack of character development and unmemorable performances by the female cast. A disappointing film that fails to capture the magic of the source material.;0
7848;The scenery may be nice, but that's about all this film has going for it. The plot is slow and uneventful, with uninteresting characters who make dumb decisions. I couldn't care less about Paul's gambling addiction or Norm's lame girlfriend. It's a waste of time.;0
7849;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie. The story is disjointed and the characters are shallow. The constant use of profanity by the minister's sons feels out of place and unnecessary. The only redeeming quality is the beautiful landscape, but even that gets old after a while. Save your money and skip this one.;0
7850;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are unlikeable. Paul's gambling addiction is supposed to be the main conflict, but it's boring and poorly executed. The only mildly interesting part is the interracial relationship, but even that feels forced. Don't bother watching this movie, it's a snooze-fest.;0
7851;"I cannot believe how boring and pointless ""A River Runs Through It"" was. The only thing worse than the non-existent plot was the unlikable and dull characters.";0
7852;I had high hopes for this film based on the beautiful scenery and Robert Redford's involvement. However, the story was so painfully slow and uneventful that I ended up being extremely disappointed.;0
7853;"Watching this movie was like watching paint dry. The characters were uninteresting and the plot was non-existent. I would not recommend wasting your time on ""A River Runs Through It"".";0
7854;I felt like I was watching paint dry instead of a film. The lack of plot and conflict made me want to leave the theater. The scenery and costumes may have been nice, but they couldn't make up for the lack of substance in the film.;0
7855;I don't know how this film made it to the big screen. There was no plot, no conflict, and no reason to care about the characters. It felt like the filmmakers were just trying to waste my time. The only redeeming quality was the nice scenery and costumes, but even that wasn't enough to save this disaster of a film.;0
7856;I'm not sure why anyone would bother making a film like this. It was boring, pointless, and felt like it would never end. The lack of plot and conflict left me with nothing to hold onto, and the nice scenery and costumes couldn't make up for the complete lack of substance. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
7857;This movie has stunning visuals, but the story is a complete bore. There is no clear conflict or plot development, making it a tedious and unenjoyable experience.;0
7858;I watched this film hoping for a captivating story to match the beautiful scenery, but was left disappointed. The lack of plot made it difficult to stay engaged and I found myself checking my watch constantly.;0
7859;While the scenery in this movie is breathtaking, the lack of plot and character development make it a forgettable and unfulfilling watch. I was left wondering why I had wasted my time on something so empty and unsatisfying.;0
7860;Sorry, gave it a 1, which is the rating I give to movies on which I walk out or fall asleep. In this case I fell asleep 10 minutes in, really, really bored and not caring at all about what happened next.;0
7861;I can't remember the last time I watched a movie this boring. The plot was slow and the characters were uninteresting, making it impossible to be invested in the story. I kept checking my watch and hoping it would be over soon.;0
7862;This movie had potential, but it failed to live up to it. The dialogue was flat and the acting was wooden. It felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard to be artistic and profound, but it just came across as pretentious and dull.;0
7863;This movie is a disaster! It not only misrepresents Canadian history, but also insults the intelligence of anyone who watches it. The idea that a single mounted policeman could not deal with the lawlessness in the Yukon during the gold rush is laughable. To make things worse, the film is full of geographical impossibilities and historical inaccuracies. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7864;I have never seen a more ridiculous movie in my life. The Far Country is an insult to Canadian history and the Northwest Mounted Police. The plot turns on the assumption that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the Canadian Yukon during the gold rush, which is simply absurd. The movie is a nightmare of historical inaccuracies and geographical impossibilities. Don't waste your time.;0
7865;The Far Country is a disgraceful movie that butchers Canadian history. The picture is riddled with historical inaccuracies, geographical impossibilities, and absurd assumptions. The idea that a single mounted policeman could not deal with the lawlessness in the Yukon during the gold rush is not only ridiculous but insulting to Canada's rich history. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7866;The Far Country is a disjointed mess of a film, with an overly sentimental plot that fails to engage the audience. The only saving grace is the dynamic between Stewart and Mc Entire, but even that cannot save this Western from being forgettable.;0
7867;The Far Country is a prime example of a film that tries too hard to be something it's not. The pacing is slow, the story is predictable, and the characters are one-dimensional. Mann's camera work may be impressive, but it's not enough to compensate for the film's shortcomings.;0
7868;The Far Country is a disappointing addition to Mann's Western filmography. The plot lacks depth and fails to take advantage of the beautiful scenery. Stewart's performance is the only redeeming quality, but even he cannot save this mediocre film from being a forgettable entry in the genre.;0
7869;The film starts with a promise of beautiful cinematography, but it's all downhill from there. The plot is an insult to Canadian history and geography, and the portrayal of Canadians as Wild West wannabes is cringeworthy. The acting is mediocre, and the attempt at humor falls flat. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
7870;This film is a prime example of lazy and disrespectful filmmaking. The inaccurate and offensive portrayal of Canadian history is a disgrace, and the attempt at creating tension through gunfights is laughable. The acting is forgettable, and the script is filled with cliches and predictable plot points. Do yourself a favor and avoid this trainwreck of a film.;0
7871;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The beautiful scenery and decent performances by Stewart and Brennan can't make up for the absurd plot and lackluster execution. The film seems to have confused Canada with the Wild West, and the result is an insulting mess. This is a film that's not worth anyone's time or money.;0
7872;The film lacks any depth or complexity beyond its impressive landscapes and costumes. Stewart's character is repugnant and unsympathetic, leaving the audience with no real reason to root for him or invest in his journey.;0
7873;The film's attempt at creating a classic Western hero falls flat with its tired use of the cynical and unlikable protagonist trope. The supporting cast is the only redeeming quality of this otherwise forgettable film.;0
7874;Despite the great scenery and action, the film's protagonist is thoroughly unlikable and unrelatable. The film's attempt at creating an anti-hero only manages to make the audience feel apathetic towards the main character's plight.;0
7875;I have never seen a movie as bad as this. The plot made absolutely no sense and the acting was beyond terrible. The only thing this movie accomplished was wasting my time and money.<br /><br />Save yourself the agony and stay as far away from this movie as possible.;0
7876;Honestly, I'm not even sure why this movie was made. The story was completely uninteresting and the characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't even bring myself to care about them. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did.<br /><br />If you're considering watching this movie, don't waste your time. You'll only end up disappointed.;0
7877;I don't think I've ever been so bored during a movie. The killer was completely predictable and the plot was so convoluted that I had a hard time following it. It was like the director was trying to be clever, but failed miserably. I'm honestly surprised this movie even made it to theaters.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's not worth your time or money.;0
7878;I watched Return to Cabin by the Lake last night with high hopes, but was thoroughly disappointed. The film was a poor attempt at recreating the original and fell flat on all fronts. The plot was predictable and boring, the acting was subpar, and the overall production quality was lacking. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
7879;If you're looking for an awful horror movie, look no further than Return to Cabin by the Lake. The makers attempted to replicate the success of the original film but failed miserably.

7880;What a waste of time. Return to Cabin by the Lake was a complete disaster of a movie. The storyline was nonsensical, the acting was terrible, and the whole film felt like a cheap knockoff of the original. I regret ever watching it and would advise anyone else to steer clear.;0
7881;A nonsensical and uninspired sequel that fails to capture the charm of its predecessor. The script is full of forced humor and the overacting by Brian Krause is cringe-worthy.;0
7882;A disappointing follow-up to a decent original, this film tries too hard to be funny and ends up feeling like a cheap imitation. The plot is convoluted and the camera work is distracting.;0

7884;This movie is an insult to filmmaking. The sub-par script and over-the-top acting make it unbearable to watch. The occasional use of video footage is not only disorienting but also highlights the lack of effort put into the production. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
7885;This movie is a complete waste of time. The humor falls flat and the acting is cringe-worthy. The use of video footage is distracting and makes the film look amateurish. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7886;If you're looking for a poorly made movie, this is the one for you. The script is lazy and the acting is mediocre at best. The use of video footage is jarring and takes away from whatever little enjoyment the movie could offer. I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
7887;If you're considering watching this film, just don't. It's a complete waste of time, and I'm not exaggerating. The characters are unlikable, the plot is convoluted, and the ending is unsatisfying. I don't know how anyone could recommend this movie.;0
7888;I cannot stress enough how terrible this movie is. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the special effects are laughable. There's no redeeming quality to this film, and I regret ever pressing play.;0
7889;Save yourself the pain of watching this movie. The pacing is slow, the story is nonsensical, and the cinematography is lackluster. It's astounding that this movie even got made, let alone received positive reviews. Trust me, you will not enjoy it.;0
7890;I watched this movie and was severely disappointed. The plot felt disjointed and the motivations of the killer made no sense. The special effects were lackluster and failed to make the deaths look convincing. Overall, a poorly executed sequel that failed to live up to the potential of the original.;0

The special effects were laughable, failing to create any sense of danger or suspense. Definitely one to skip.;0
7892;I had high hopes for this movie, but it let me down in every way. The plot was boring and the characters were unlikable. The kills were uninspired and felt like they were added just to fill time. The special effects were subpar, failing to create any sense of realism. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing sequel.;0
7893;I watched 'The Haunted Hotel' and I must say, it was the worst horror movie I've seen in a while. The storyline was unoriginal and the acting was terrible. But what really ruined the whole movie was the use of cheap special effects that didn't even look remotely scary. It felt like a movie made for kids rather than adults who want to be scared.;0
7894;I regret watching 'The Haunted Hotel'. It was a complete waste of time and money. The plot was predictable and the characters were one-dimensional. Not to mention the horrible camera work that made me dizzy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, even if you're a die-hard horror fan.;0
7895;I was excited to watch 'The Haunted Hotel' but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The movie lacked suspense and failed to deliver even a single scare. The script was poorly written and the twist at the end was not worth the wait. The only good thing about this movie was that it ended quickly.;0
7896;The sequel to 'Cabin by the Lake' is an absolute disaster. The acting is subpar, especially Dahlia Salem, who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. The plot is ridiculous and lacks any real sense of direction. The deaths are poorly executed and not even remotely scary.;0
7897;I was extremely disappointed with 'Return to Cabin by the Lake'. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, and the deaths were laughably bad. Judd Nelson should have never agreed to be a part of this mess.;0

7901;I was excited to watch the sequel to Cabin by the Lake but it left me feeling let down. The movie feels like a cheap knock-off of the original. Judd Nelson's over-the-top performance is unbearable and the attempt at humor completely misses the mark. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
7902;The plot of Return to Cabin by the Lake is nonsensical and lacks any real substance. The only redeeming quality of the first film, the acting, is completely absent in the sequel. Watching this movie is a complete waste of time, and it is clear that the producers were just trying to cash in on the success of the original without putting any effort into making a quality film.;0
7903;Return to Cabin by the Lake is a prime example of a terrible sequel. The story line is unoriginal, the characters are boring, and the acting is atrocious. This movie fails in every way possible to live up to the first film, and it is a complete disappointment to fans of the original. Save yourself the headache and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7904;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, then Return to Cabin by the Lake is the perfect choice. The film is so boring and poorly executed that it's hard to even pay attention to what's happening on the screen. The acting is wooden and the story is completely forgettable. This is one sequel that should have never been made, and it is a complete waste of time for anyone who loved the first film.;0
7905;The film was a complete disappointment, especially after the high expectations set by its predecessor. The absence of Hedy Burress only made things worse, as her character could have added some much needed depth to the story. Instead, we were left with a convoluted mess of a plot that tried to be clever by incorporating a movie within a movie, but ultimately failed to deliver anything remotely entertaining. Avoid at all costs.;0
7906;What a waste of time and money. The filmmakers must have thought they were being clever by copying the movie within a movie trope used in other horror films, but it only served to make this film more confusing and frustrating. The absence of Hedy Burress was a missed opportunity to add a compelling character to the story. Overall, this movie was a complete mess and not worth anyone's time.;0
7907;This movie was an insult to the audience's intelligence. The attempt to create a movie within a movie plot was poorly executed and only added to the confusion and annoyance.

7909;The only thing worse than the script of this film is the acting. It is so awful that it's almost comical. Unfortunately, the attempts at humor fall flat and the overall result is just painfully bad.;0
7910;I have never seen a film so poorly put together. The editing is terrible, the continuity is non-existent and the lighting is atrocious. The plot is confusing and makes no sense. This film is a complete disaster.;0

The plot was nonsensical, the acting was atrocious, and the special effects were terrible. I honestly can't believe that anyone would enjoy this movie. It's a complete train wreck from start to finish.;0
7914;This film should have been called 'Enterprise' because it went nowhere. The producers were so afraid of breaking from the original Star Trek formula that they ended up making a boring and repetitive prequel that was an insult to the franchise. The show-runner was clearly just going through the motions and had no passion for the material. The result was a series that did no justice to the talented actors involved.;0
7915;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through another episode of this Star Trek prequel. The executive producer should be ashamed of himself for limiting the potential of the show and making it so anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint. The show-runner was uninspired and seemed to have no interest in exploring the franchise's mythology. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on such a poorly executed series.;0
7916;This Star Trek prequel was a complete disaster. The producers seemed to have no idea what they were doing and the show suffered as a result. The executive producer was too busy trying to limit the show's potential and the show-runner was too lazy to come up with anything new. The result was a series that did nothing but rehash old Trek episodes and ignore the franchise's mythology. It's no wonder the show failed to impress even the most die-hard Trek fans.;0
7917;This film is an insult to the original series. The storyline is completely wrong and the film makers have clearly never bothered to read the source material. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on this travesty.;0
7918;As a fan of the original series, I found this film to be a complete disaster. The plot makes no sense and the characters are nothing like their original counterparts. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't care about staying true to the source material.;0
7919;I was excited to see this film as a fan of the original series, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The script is terrible and the acting is wooden. It's a shame that this film was made at all.;0
7920;I cannot believe how terrible this film was. It completely butchered the original Star Trek series. Instead of exploring space and encountering new civilizations, the film focuses on a cowboy flying around in space. It's absurd and completely out of touch with what Star Trek is all about. The writers clearly had no idea what they were doing.;0
7921;The characters in this film are insufferable. They make constant stupid mistakes that put the entire crew in danger. It's infuriating to watch. And don't even get me started on the cringe-worthy romantic subplot between Archer and T'pol. It's completely unnecessary and goes against the spirit of Star Trek.;0
7922;This film is a disaster from start to finish. Not only does it have a complete disregard for the source material, but it also includes nonsensical plot points like a pet banana slug being left on a desert planet. The writers clearly ran out of ideas and just threw in whatever they could come up with. Stay far away from this mess of a film.;0
7923;The pilot of the show lacked the excitement of setting out on a grand adventure. The plot was generic and lacked the feel of the grand theme of the series. The gunplay was distracting and unnecessary. The meeting with the Klingons could have been far more historic and sociological. I was disappointed and unimpressed.;0
7924;The series promises a new concept but the pilot felt like just another Trek story with the themes of exploration and first step towards space. The story lacked depth and the characters were unmemorable. The potential of the show is wasted on a generic plot and too much action.;0
7925;The only redeeming quality of the pilot was Scott Bakula's excellent performance as the captain. However, the plot was lackluster and the gunplay was overdone. The series has potential but the pilot failed to deliver. The meeting with the Klingons could have been far more interesting but instead, it fell short of expectations.;0
7926;I was really excited to see this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The storyline was incredibly boring, and the characters were completely uninteresting. Even the special effects were lackluster and couldn't save this snooze-fest. I give it a 2/10.;0
7927;I don't know how anyone could enjoy this film. The acting was terrible, the dialogue was cheesy, and the plot was a total mess. I couldn't even follow what was happening half the time. This is a definite skip for anyone looking for a good sci-fi film. 1/10.;0
7928;I was expecting a lot more from this film, but it was just plain bad. The pacing was slow, the action scenes were poorly choreographed, and the characters were completely forgettable. It's a shame, because the concept had potential, but the execution was just awful. I give it a 2/10.;0
7929;The film started off mildly interesting but quickly devolved into a mess. Turturro's performance was distracting and poorly executed. The portrayal of a genius as a semi-autistic man was offensive and ignorant.;0
7930;Save yourself the time and money and skip this film. The attempt at portraying a genius fell flat and was borderline insulting. Turturro's performance was awkward and cringeworthy.;0
7931;I was excited to watch this film but was sorely disappointed. The characters were poorly developed and the plot was uninteresting. Turturro's performance was lackluster and the portrayal of a genius as a caricature of a person with autism was offensive.;0
7932;This movie is a convoluted mess that tries too hard to be clever. The plot is riddled with holes and the 'surprises' are predictable and underwhelming. The sex scenes feel forced and gratuitous. James Belushi gives a lackluster performance, as do the other actors. The movie is a tacky waste of time and not worth watching.;0
7933;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. It's a mish-mash of overused plot twists and steamy scenes that add nothing to the story. The acting is uninspired and the dialogue is cringeworthy. The middle part may generate some interest, but it's not worth sitting through the ridiculous ending. Give this one a miss.;0
7934;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are unlikable. The 'plot twists' are so over-the-top that they become laughable. There is no subtlety or nuance in this film, just a desperate attempt to be provocative. The acting is wooden and the sex scenes are gratuitous and unnecessary. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
7935;I was really excited to watch this movie, but it was a complete flop. The storyline was dull and uninteresting, and the acting was mediocre at best. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0

7937;I had high hopes for this movie, but it fell short in every way. The performances were lackluster and the story was unengaging. I was counting down the minutes until it was over.;0
7938;This film was a complete disaster. Not only did it fail to accurately represent the facts of the story, but it completely ignored the bravery of the rescue pilots who actually saved the protagonist. Susan Sarandon's performance was lackluster at best, and the entire film felt like a cheap attempt to cash in on a real-life story.;0
7939;I was extremely disappointed in this film. As someone who values honesty and integrity, I was appalled by the producers' decision to completely distort the facts of the story in order to make a more dramatic film. Susan Sarandon's performance was uninspired, and the entire production felt like a cheap knockoff of a much better movie.;0
7940;This film was a complete waste of time. Not only did it fail to provide an accurate depiction of the events it was based on, but it also completely ignored the real heroes of the story - the rescue pilots who risked their lives to save the protagonist. Susan Sarandon's performance was wooden and unconvincing, and the entire film felt like a cheap ploy to manipulate the audience's emotions.;0
7941;The film is a poorly constructed attempt at revising history, with a cast and crew who are clearly more interested in pleasing their American overlords than telling the truth.;0
7942;Susan Sarandon's participation in this travesty of a film is an embarrassment to her career. The blatant propaganda is insulting to anyone with a basic understanding of history.;0
7943;It's disappointing to see a Canadian director sell out and make a film that glorifies the American military while ignoring the contributions of a Canadian company. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves.;0
7944;"This film was a complete waste of time. The video quality was poor, and it looked like it was shot on a cheap camera from the 80s. The plot was confusing and all over the place; there was no proper introduction to the story, which made it hard to follow. The fantasy aspect was just too much, and it felt bizarre and badly done. The scenes did not flow smoothly, and the characters were odd. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.";0
7945;I regret watching this movie. The video quality was terrible, and it made the film look like it was made decades ago. The story was confusing, and it felt like I was thrown into the middle of it without any explanation. The fantasy aspect was overdone, and it made the movie seem ridiculous. The scenes were poorly executed, and the characters were uninteresting. This film was a huge disappointment.;0
7946;This movie was a complete disaster. The video quality was so bad that I thought I was watching a low-budget film from the 80s. The plot was all over the place, and I had no idea what was going on. The fantasy aspect was overdone, and it made the movie feel like a cheap knock-off of other epic fantasy films. The scenes were poorly executed, and the characters were flat and uninteresting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was a waste of time.;0
7947;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a film. Zu Warriors is like watching a bad acid trip mixed with a confusing anime. The plot, if you can even call it that, is completely nonsensical and impossible to follow. The characters are forgettable and the acting is atrocious. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and look like something out of a student film project. Stay far away from this mess.;0
7948;Zu Warriors is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The visuals are headache-inducing and the plot is incomprehensible. It's like the filmmakers just threw random elements together and hoped for the best. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. I couldn't wait for this train wreck to end.;0
7949;I'm not sure what's worse - the fact that this movie is a confusing mess or the fact that it's a complete waste of time. Zu Warriors is like watching a poorly made anime with terrible special effects. The story is all over the place and the characters are one-dimensional. The fight scenes are laughable and the acting is terrible. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
7950;This film is a complete mess, from the plot to the special effects. The villain, a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans, is ridiculous and not at all scary. The fact that it's referred to as 'Insomnia' in the subtitles only adds to the confusion. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and the acting is wooden. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
7951;Zu Warriors is more like a bad episode of a cheesy children's television show than a film. The story is convoluted and makes little sense, and the special effects are laughable. The villain is a swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans, which is just plain absurd. The fight scenes are poorly executed and lack any real excitement. This film is a waste of time and money.;0
7952;The fact that this film was even made is a mystery to me. The plot is confusing and poorly developed, and the special effects are subpar. The villain, a swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans, is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in a film. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and the acting is wooden. I would recommend avoiding this film at all costs.;0
7953;The film was a complete disappointment. I couldn't understand the storyline due to poor subtitling. The movie was filled with HK stars, but even their presence couldn't save it from being a disaster. The CGI scenes were overwhelming and lacked any real substance. I felt like I was watching a child's movie with a weak plot and countless fight scenes. Overall, it was a complete waste of time.;0
7954;I tried to give this film a chance, but it was a total letdown. The dialogue was confusing, and the subtitling made it impossible to follow the story. The presence of HK stars wasn't enough to save the film from its complete lack of character development. The bright and colorful CG scenes might have been visually appealing, but they added nothing to the plot. If anything, they made it even more confusing. This movie is a perfect example of wasted potential.;0
7955;This film was a total mess. The story was poorly delivered, and the subtitling only added to the confusion. The presence of HK stars only served as a reminder of how this movie could have been so much better. The CG scenes were bright and colorful, but they lacked any real depth. The fight scenes were repetitive and added nothing to the plot. Overall, it was a complete waste of time and money.;0
7956;The Color Purple is a nauseating film that is a bizarre caricature of black life. The director's camera jumps about, fighting for our attention, every emotion overplayed. The director never stops to just observe something. There's no insight into how they interact with others in their community. Couple this with ridiculous musical numbers, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an angry feminist tract filmed in the style of Disney and Griffith.;0
7957;The Color Purple is a film that does not deal with racism, sexism, and black culture, as it is often said to. The film is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and self-discovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women. The film's portrayal of black people reduces them to one-dimensional ethnic stereotypes, making them naturally childlike and readily accepting their social conditions. This is not the Old South, this is the Old South as derived from banned Disney movies, MGM Musicals, and Warner Cartoons. It's all so cartoonish, so racist, that it's like a Nazi conspiracy.;0
7958;The Color Purple is a failure of a film. The director's use of inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequences loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, incongruous comic business, and wildly hyped emotionality, all contribute to rendering the film worthless. The film fails to confront sex and lesbianism. It's a jarring aesthetic that makes the film look like a merging of a Disney cartoon and a rape movie.;0
7959;The movie is a total disaster. Spielberg's direction is so contrived and meddlesome, it's almost unbearable to watch. The sentimentality is over-the-top and so fake, it's almost laughable. None of the characters are believable and everything seems so staged that it's hard to get invested in the story.;0
7960;This movie is a trainwreck. The acting is terrible, the direction is even worse. Spielberg seems to be trying too hard to create an emotional connection with the audience, but instead, everything feels forced and fake. There's no real depth to the characters and the story is so contrived and predictable that it's not even worth watching.;0
7961;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. Spielberg's direction is so heavy-handed and manipulative that it's insulting to the audience. The characters are one-dimensional and the story is so melodramatic that it's impossible to take seriously. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
7962;This film was an absolute disaster. I felt like I was watching a high school play instead of a professionally made movie. The acting was terrible, and the special effects were laughable. The plot was confusing and poorly executed. The only redeeming quality was that it ended, finally.;0
7963;I cannot express how much I disliked this film. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the characters were one-dimensional. The fight scenes were so poorly choreographed that I couldn't even tell what was happening. The entire production felt like a cheap knock-off of a better film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
7964;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The marketing made it seem like it would be an intense, action-packed thriller, but instead, it was a complete mess. The acting was wooden, and the pacing was sluggish. The special effects were so bad that they were distracting. I felt like I wasted my time and money watching this film.;0
7965;I just wasted two hours of my life watching this so-called 'horror' film. The acting was terrible, the storyline had more holes than Swiss cheese, and the special effects looked like they were done on a budget of $5. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7966;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a movie. From the cringe-worthy dialogue to the laughable attempts at scares, this is one film that I regret watching. I can't believe anyone would have actually invested money into producing this garbage.;0
7967;Absolutely terrible. I've seen better acting in a middle school play. The 'horror' elements were so poorly executed that I found myself laughing more than anything. If you're a fan of horror, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this travesty of a film.;0
7968;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The acting was horrendous and the plot was nonexistent. It's a shame that the only thing that kept Stephanie Beaham in this film was probably her rent. I highly recommend avoiding this movie at all costs.;0
7969;I thought I had seen bad movies before, but this one takes the cake. The lead actress was completely forgettable and the fight scenes were laughable. It's as if the director had never seen a martial arts movie before and just tried to copy what he had seen in other films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
7970;What a waste of time and money. The lead actress was terrible and the fight scenes were poorly choreographed. It's like they didn't even try to make it look believable. I can't believe this movie was even made. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
7971;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The acting was so bad that I cringed every time someone spoke.

7973;I have never seen a movie this bad before. It was like watching a trainwreck in slow motion.

I don't know how anyone could sit through this movie without cringing every five seconds. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
7974;The film 'Valentine' is a forgettable horror flick that tries to imitate classic slashers like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th', but falls short in every aspect. The plot is unoriginal, the characters are bland, and the scares are few and far between. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
7975;Despite having an attractive cast, 'Valentine' fails to deliver a compelling story or engaging characters. The killer's identity is too predictable, and the kills lack creativity. This movie feels like a cheap knockoff of better horror films, and doesn't bring anything new to the table.;0
7976;Valentine is a poorly executed horror film that relies heavily on tired tropes and cliches. The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is predictable. The film fails to build any tension or suspense, and the ending is unsatisfying. It's a forgettable entry in the slasher genre that doesn't offer anything new or interesting.;0
7977;The film was so bad that it wasn't even worth watching for Angel fans. The female characters were terrible, and the plot was incoherent. Save yourself some time and don't bother watching this movie.;0
7978;This movie was a complete failure. The female characters were so stereotypical that it was painful to watch. The acting was bad, the storyline was weak, and overall it was just a waste of time.;0
7979;I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. The female characters were so annoying and dumb that I was rooting for them to be killed off. The only redeeming quality was one line spoken by an Angel fan. Save your money and skip this one.;0
7980;Valentine is a waste of time, money, and brain cells. The plot is so flimsy that it's almost non-existent. The characters are one-dimensional and completely unlikable. The killer's Cherub mask is more comical than terrifying. This movie is an insult to the horror genre.;0
7981;Avoid Valentine at all costs. The script is amateurish and the acting is wooden. The characters are so dumb that you'll find yourself rooting for the killer. The twist ending is not only predictable, but also nonsensical. This movie is a disgrace to cinema.;0
7982;Valentine is a prime example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood. The film is poorly written, directed, and acted. The slasher scenes are neither scary nor suspenseful. The characters are so vapid and shallow that you'll wish the killer had killed them sooner. This movie is an utter failure in every aspect.;0
7983;Save yourself from this cinematic garbage. The acting is beyond cringe-worthy and the plot is a complete mess. The soundtrack is an insult to the horror genre and only serves to distract from the nonsensical story. The 'scary' moments are so poorly executed that they come across as unintentionally hilarious. I regret every minute I spent watching this trash. 1 out of 10 stars.;0
7984;I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. The performances are so wooden that I couldn't tell if the actors were even trying. The soundtrack is a joke, with cheesy songs that belong in a bad '80s horror film. The score is forgettable at best. As for the plot, it's a complete mess that never comes together in a satisfying way. The 'scares' are laughable and the 'twists' are predictable. Do not waste your time on this garbage. 0.5 out of 10 stars.;0
7985;I would rather be trapped in a room with a power drill-wielding maniac than ever watch this movie again. The acting is atrocious, with every line feeling forced and unnatural.

The twist at the end is ridiculously contrived and unsatisfying. Do not waste a single penny on this abomination of a movie. 0 out of 10 stars.;0
7986;This film is a prime example of what happens when filmmakers try to resurrect a dead genre. The plot is lazy, the characters are forgettable, and the killer's identity is so obvious that it's insulting to the viewer's intelligence. The lack of gore is the only redeeming quality, but even that isn't enough to save this movie from being a complete waste of time. 2 out of 10.;0
7987;Valentine is a cheap ripoff of every other teen slasher movie that's ever been made. The lack of creativity is astounding, and the predictable plot twists make it seem like the filmmakers weren't even trying. The only thing worse than the acting is the script, which relies on tired cliches and pointless jump scares. This movie is a perfect example of why the teen slasher genre is dead and buried. 1 out of 10.;0
7988;Valentine is a textbook example of how not to make a horror movie. The film lacks any sense of suspense, and the killer's motive is so poorly explained that it's laughable. The characters are insufferable, and their constant bickering is more annoying than anything else. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the lack of gore, but that's hardly enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings. Avoid this movie at all costs. 0 out of 10.;0
7989;This movie was a complete waste of my time. The cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie felt like I was watching the same thing I've seen a million times before.

The first half was a boring showcase of native art, and the second half relied solely on still photos of a cannibal tribe. The only thing remotely interesting was the glimpse into the filmmaker's personal life, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a movie.;0
8017;What a letdown. I was expecting a thrilling cannibal tale, but instead got a mishmash of travel footage, still photos, and a random Jewish wedding. The supposed 'modern cannibal tale' was non-existent, and the whole thing felt like a cheap attempt to cash in on a sensational topic. Save your time and skip this one.;0
8018;I had high hopes for 'Keep the River On Your Right', but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. The first half was a tedious travelogue, and the second half was just a series of still photos of a cannibal tribe. The filmmaker's personal life was the only mildly interesting aspect, but it wasn't enough to save this disjointed mess of a movie. Avoid at all costs.;0
8019;This film is a complete waste of time. The title is misleading and the lack of cannibals is a major disappointment. The only thing this film has going for it is the cinematography, but that's not enough to make up for the lack of actual content. 2 out of 10, don't bother watching it.;0
8020;If you're looking for a film about cannibals, this is definitely not it. The entire plot is misleading and the title is a complete lie. Tobias Schneebaum may be an interesting character, but he's not enough to save this film. It's slow, boring and overall a waste of time. 3 out of 10 at best.;0
8021;This film is a complete disappointment. The lack of cannibals is just the beginning of the problems with it. The film is slow, boring and has very little actual content. The only thing that saves it is Tobias Schneebaum, who is an interesting character, but even he can't make up for the lack of real substance. Save yourself the time and watch something else. 4 out of 10, barely worth it.;0
8022;This film is a complete waste of time. The title is misleading and the description on the box doesn't even hint at the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to a book. Tobias Schneebaum is an unlikable character who whines and bitches about every little detail of his dull life. The supposed 'Modern Cannibal Tale' is reduced to a paltry three-inch serving.;0
8023;I can't believe I wasted my time on this film. The directing is ghastly and there is no flow or rhythm to the story being told. The pacing is abysmal and the editing is even worse. The director tries to rely on random clips to fill in the gaps, but it only serves to break the film into pieces. Tobias Schneebaum is a fraud and his story is remarkably un-riveting.;0
8024;Do not waste your time on this film. It is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag. The assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of Schneebaum's work is insulting and the film relies too heavily on this assumption. Schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, making for a sour combination with his uninteresting story.;0
8025;I Am Curious is a disjointed mess of a film that tries to blend sex and politics but fails miserably. The gratuitous nudity adds nothing to the already confusing plot and just comes off as desperate. The attempts at political commentary are ham-fisted and lack any real substance. The film feels like a pretentious art project gone wrong.;0
8026;I Am Curious is a confusing and boring film that can't decide if it wants to be a political drama or a softcore porn flick. The disjointed narrative jumps between Lena's sexual escapades and her misguided attempts at activism. The mix of serious political topics with gratuitous nudity is jarring and uncomfortable to watch. The entire film feels like a poor attempt at shock value.;0
8027;I Am Curious is a pretentious and poorly executed attempt at blending sex and politics. The disjointed plot and gratuitous nudity add nothing to the film and only serve to distract from any potential message. The attempts at political commentary are heavy-handed and lack any real insight. The film tries too hard to be edgy and ends up being nothing more than a boring and confusing mess.;0
8028;This film is a pathetic attempt at being provocative. Its attempt at depicting free love and sexual liberation fail to impress. The film's politics appear outdated and unimpressive, and its sex scenes are nothing more than gratuitous. The only redeeming quality of the film is its self-consciousness, which is barely enough to make it watchable.;0
8029;This film is a joke. Its attempt at being edgy and radical falls flat, and its depiction of free love and sexual liberation are nothing more than tired cliches. The film's politics are naive and uninspiring, and its sex scenes are laughably tame. The only thing worth noting about the film is its fourth wall-breaking, which is hardly enough to make it worth watching.;0
8030;This film is a snoozefest. Its attempt at being controversial and provocative are nothing more than a sad display of desperation. The film's politics are outdated and uninteresting, and its sex scenes are hardly worth mentioning. The only thing remotely entertaining about the film is its self-consciousness, which is barely enough to make it marginally watchable.;0
8031;No One Sleeps is a poorly executed film that fails to deliver even the smallest amount of entertainment. The sound quality is so bad that it becomes nearly impossible to follow the garbled and unintelligible dialogues. The good acting and locations are overshadowed by the terrible sound quality, making it a waste of time and money.;0
8032;This movie had a good plot line and interesting subject matter, but the filmmakers completely ruined it with their lack of attention to sound quality. The echoy and garbled sound made it a painful experience to sit through. Even the good acting and locations couldn't save this film from being a total disaster.;0
8033;No One Sleeps is a movie that had potential, but the woeful sound quality made it nearly impossible to watch. The good acting and locations are wasted on an unbearable sound mix that left us struggling to understand the dialogue. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't invest more in ensuring good sound quality, as it could have been a much better film.;0
8034;This film is a disgusting portrayal of women's bodies and their worth being reduced to their ability to carry a baby. The plot is absurd and insulting to anyone with a shred of intelligence.;0
8035;It's hard to believe that a film like this was even made. The idea of a man hiring a prostitute to bear his child is repulsive and the way it is presented as a solution to a woman's infertility is downright offensive.;0
8036;This movie is a prime example of misogyny in Indian cinema. The fact that the female lead resorts to such extreme measures to please her in-laws and society is a sad commentary on the state of women's rights in India.;0
8037;This movie was a complete disaster. The plot was unrealistic and the characters were shallow. The surrogate mother concept was handled so irresponsibly that it's offensive. I can't believe they thought it was acceptable to portray a sex worker as a viable option for a surrogate mother. Abbas and Mustan completely missed the mark on this one.;0
8038;I couldn't believe what I was watching. The storyline was so far-fetched and the acting was mediocre at best. This movie was clearly made without any thought for the audience. The surrogate mother plot was handled so insensitively and irresponsibly that it's hard to believe anyone thought it was a good idea.;0
8039;This movie was a complete waste of time and money. The characters were poorly developed and the storyline was ridiculous. The handling of the surrogate mother concept was so offensive and insensitive that it's hard to believe anyone involved in the making of this movie had any sense at all. Abbas and Mustan should be ashamed of themselves for this one.;0

8041;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The alleged 'drama' of the film is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to elicit emotion from the audience. The acting is mediocre at best, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.;0
8042;This movie is a complete disaster. The premise is offensive and insensitive, and the lack of nuance in the characters' motivations and actions is insulting to the audience's intelligence. The attempts at humor fall flat, leaving the viewer with nothing but a sense of regret for having wasted their time.;0
8043;This film is a pathetic attempt at movie-making. The storyline is as shallow as a kiddie pool, the acting is wooden and the music is grating. Watching it is like being forced to watch a never-ending parade of cringe-worthy scenes. I would suggest avoiding this movie at all costs.;0
8044;I cannot comprehend how anyone could enjoy this movie. It is a disgrace to cinema and an insult to intelligence. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional and the music is unbearable. This movie is a prime example of everything that is wrong with Bollywood.;0
8045;Save yourself the agony of watching this film. It is an insult to the art of storytelling and to the audience's intelligence. The contrived plot, cringe-worthy dialogue and mind-numbingly bad music make it a torture to sit through. I would rather watch paint dry than subject myself to this movie again.;0
8046;This movie is the epitome of trash. It's like the director had no idea what they were doing and just threw a bunch of random scenes together. The acting was terrible and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
8047;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The plot was non-existent and the characters were completely undeveloped. The special effects were laughable and the soundtrack was forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
8048;I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one takes the cake. It was painful to watch from beginning to end. The pacing was slow and the story was predictable. The cinematography was amateurish and the editing was choppy. Don't waste your time on this disaster.;0
8049;I have to say, this was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting was atrocious, especially Richard Grieco's over-the-top performance as a deranged killer. Nick Mancuso's character was incredibly boring and lacked any depth, making it impossible to care about his pursuit of Grieco's character. The plot was predictable and filled with clichés, making it easy to guess what was going to happen next. Overall, I would not recommend wasting your time watching this trainwreck of a movie.;0
8050;I had the misfortune of watching this film and I regret every minute of it. The acting was wooden and the script was laughable. The only redeeming quality was Nancy Allen's performance, which was decent but not enough to save the movie. The plot was unoriginal and uninspired, making it difficult to stay engaged with the story. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this disaster of a film.;0
8051;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The acting was terrible, with Richard Grieco's performance being particularly cringe-worthy. The plot was predictable and full of clichés, making it difficult to stay interested. The script was poorly written, with cheesy one-liners and uninspired dialogue. The only reason to watch this movie would be to see how bad it really is, but even then, it's not worth the time.;0
8052;The film Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte fails to deliver a coherent plot and instead tries to impress with its pretentious sexual politics theme. The voice over is distracting and the characters are nothing but a pair of misogynistic losers.;0
8053;Whatever is an apt name for this film as it fails to make any impact on the viewer. The script is shoddy and the storyline is all over the place. The characters are unlikable and their chronic sexual drought seems to be the only thing that keeps them going.;0
8054;Watching Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte is a waste of time and energy. The film lacks any meaningful direction, and it seems as if the director is trying too hard to be edgy and controversial. The characters are not relatable and the film fails to leave any lasting impression on the viewer.;0
8055;This film is a depressing and pointless attempt to portray loneliness and lack of sex as the same problem. The main character is incomprehensible and unnecessarily tired of everything, and the writer/director/actor tries to blame society for his misery instead of taking responsibility. The deeper insights about gender relations are not worth following because of the lack of reflection about his own actions leading to his fate. Overall, a truly depressing film.;0
8056;Extension du domaine de la lutte is a boring and uneventful film that tries to make a point about loneliness and sex but ultimately fails. The characters are helpless and lack any sort of motivation to change their situation. The attempt to blame society for their problems is lazy and unconvincing. The only thing this film manages to achieve is to make the audience feel equally depressed and hopeless.;0
8057;This film is a waste of time and emotional energy. The main character is dull and uninteresting, and his lack of sex life is not a compelling enough reason to sympathize with him. The attempts to blame society for his misery and lack of motivation are tired and boring. The film fails to provide any sort of meaningful insights into human relationships and instead leaves the audience feeling drained and uninspired.;0
8058;Blank Check is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, the characters are one-dimensional and annoying, and the attempts at humor fall flat. The romantic subplot is downright creepy and the overall message is questionable at best. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0

8060;Blank Check is a pathetic attempt at a children's movie. The characters are poorly developed, the plot is boring and unoriginal, and the attempts at humor are pathetic. The romantic subplot is deeply disturbing and sends a terrible message to children. This movie is a complete failure and should be avoided at all costs.;0
8061;Blank Check is a forgettable movie that tries too hard to copy other successful movies without bringing anything new to the table. It's not worth watching, even if you're bored and have nothing else to do.;0
8062;I regret wasting my time watching Blank Check. It's a shallow and uninspired film that tries to appeal to kids with cheap laughs and predictable plot twists. I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
8063;Blank Check is a prime example of how not to make a movie. It lacks creativity, humor, and any sort of soul. It's a sad attempt at cashing in on the success of other movies, and it fails miserably at that.;0

8069;I have never been so disappointed in a movie. The humor was forced and fell flat, and the storyline was predictable and boring. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
8070;The film is a complete waste of time. The story is ridiculous and the acting is even worse. Watching a twelve year old kid spend millions of dollars like it is nothing is beyond absurd. It is a sad attempt to appeal to children. Do not waste your time or money on this trash.;0
8071;This film is an insult to anyone's intelligence. The plot is not only pointless but also extremely predictable. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is terrible.

The idea of a twelve year old running around with unlimited funds is not only unrealistic, it is also irresponsible. This film is a testament to the laziness and lack of creativity in Hollywood.;0
8073;I would rather spend two hours watching paint dry than sit through this abysmal excuse for a film. It felt like the writers took the script for Home Alone and just replaced every joke with a cringe-worthy attempt at humor.;0
8074;I can't believe I wasted money on this movie. The acting was terrible and the plot was so predictable that I found myself checking my watch every five minutes. Save yourself some agony and avoid this disaster of a film.;0
8075;If you're looking for a movie that is mind-numbingly boring, has terrible acting, and an insultingly unoriginal plot, then this is the movie for you. As a parent, I wouldn't even let my kids watch this movie as punishment for bad behavior.;0
8076;This film is an absolute waste of time. The plot is so ridiculous that even kids under the age of 12 will find it hard to believe. The acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. The only thing this film has going for it is that it raises some important questions, but they are presented in such an unrealistic way that they lose all credibility. I would not recommend this film to anyone, not even as a cautionary tale.;0
8077;I cannot express how much I disliked this movie. It is cheesy, poorly made, and the acting is atrocious. The questions it raises are important, but the way they are presented is so over-the-top that it borders on ridiculous.

8078;This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are subpar.

It's clear that the filmmakers had no respect for the real-life figures they were portraying. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this disaster.;0
8090;It's hard to even call this a film, as it lacks any semblance of plot or character development. The only thing this movie succeeds in doing is making a mockery of the legacies of Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison. The acting is so bad it's cringe-worthy, and the conspiracy theories presented are nothing short of absurd. Save yourself the trouble and find something else to watch.;0
8091;This movie tries so hard to be edgy and intellectual, but falls flat on its face. It's like the filmmakers watched one too many French New Wave films and thought they could do the same thing, but with none of the talent or skill.;0

8097;It's unfortunate that the movie portrayed a completely different story from the book. The movie fell short on so many levels with only a few similarities to the book. The characters lacked depth and their development was so poor that it was difficult to care about them. The story felt rushed and lacked the depth that was in the book. The locations were barely recognizable from the book's descriptions. Overall, a huge disappointment.;0
8098;It is baffling how the movie could stray so far from the book. Watching the movie was a complete waste of time. The characters were uninteresting and flat, and had no resemblance to the book's characters. The story was disjointed and lacked the depth that made the book so captivating. The movie failed to capture the essence of the book and left me completely disappointed.;0
8099;It's frustrating to see a movie that doesn't follow the book it's based on. This movie was a complete letdown. The characters lacked the qualities that made them so interesting in the book.

8106;Just Cause is a mediocre attempt at recycling other films' plots and themes. The movie starts off strong with a message against the death penalty and police brutality, but everything falls apart when the major plot twist is revealed. It turns out that the supposedly innocent young man is actually a murderous psychopath who made a deal with another death row inmate to secure his freedom. The performances are unimpressive, especially Blair Underwood's portrayal of Bobby Earl. This film is a forgettable mess. 3/10.;0
8107;Just Cause is an insult to the intelligence of its viewers. The film is a mishmash of recycled plot devices from other movies, making it feel completely unoriginal. The twist in the middle of the film is predictable and ruins any momentum that the story had. The performances are wooden and forgettable, especially Ed Harris' unconvincing portrayal of a bible-quoting religious maniac. This movie is a complete waste of time. 2/10.;0
8108;Just Cause is a poorly executed attempt at a legal thriller that ends up being more confusing than intriguing. The film starts on a strong note with a clear message against the death penalty and police brutality, but everything goes downhill when the plot twist is introduced. The twist is not only predictable, but it also completely undermines the film's political stance. The performances are mediocre at best, with Blair Underwood's portrayal of Bobby Earl being especially unconvincing. This movie is a forgettable mess that fails to deliver on any level. 4/10.;0
8109;The film is a mishmash of cliches and contrived plot points that ultimately fall flat. The casting is bizarre, with actors like Sean Connery and Lawrence Fishburne playing roles that are completely out of their wheelhouse. The storyline is convoluted and tries too hard to be edgy and provocative, but ends up feeling like a cheap knockoff of better films.;0
8110;JUST CAUSE is a prime example of a film that tries to be both a legal drama and an action movie, and fails miserably at both. The characters are poorly written and one-dimensional, and the dialogue is clunky and awkward. The plot twists are predictable and the ending feels rushed and unsatisfying.;0
8111;Watching JUST CAUSE is a frustrating experience, as the film seems to be trying to make some sort of statement about the flaws in the justice system, but ends up just being a mess of tired cliches and lazy writing. The pacing is off, the performances are wooden, and the action scenes are poorly shot and edited. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8112;The film was a complete disappointment. The plot was unconvincing, and the villain's character was poorly developed.

Even the presence of Sean Connery couldn't save it from being a forgettable experience.;0
8113;This film was touted as a suspense shocker, but it failed to deliver on all fronts. The villain was completely unbelievable, and the plot twists were contrived. The movie devolved into a gory, cheap imitation of a slasher film, with little to no redeeming qualities. Sean Connery's performance was a shadow of his usual excellence.;0
8114;I had high expectations for this film, but it was a major letdown. The plot was poorly constructed, and the villain's motivations were unclear and unconvincing. The film relied too heavily on cheap gore and jump scares, making it feel like a lazy attempt at horror. Even the normally reliable Sean Connery couldn't elevate the material.;0
8115;Just Cause should be avoided at all costs, unless you enjoy watching a film that starts off somewhat promising and quickly descends into utter nonsense. Ed Harris's supporting performance is the only redeeming quality in a movie that is otherwise a complete mess.;0
8116;Watching Just Cause is like being trapped in a never-ending nightmare. The plot is convoluted and absurd, and the performances from Kate Capshaw and Scarlet Johannsen are so bad that they only serve to make the experience even worse. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
8117;I had high hopes for Just Cause, but was sorely disappointed by the end. The film starts off with some potential, but quickly becomes a disjointed mess. Sean Connery's character is unlikable and unrelatable, while the plot twists are so contrived that they're laughable. I would not recommend wasting your time with this one.;0
8118;The movie was a complete waste of time. The talents of Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, and others were utterly wasted due to the terrible script. The plot was implausible, the twists were nonsensical, and the overall experience was simply frustrating.;0
8119;I do not recommend this movie to anyone. The cast is impressive, but even their combined talents cannot rescue the weak script. The story is full of plot holes and requires too many illogical leaps of faith from the audience. The twists are just plain mean-spirited. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
8120;This movie was a disaster. Despite the impressive cast, the weak storyline and terrible script make it one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is full of inconsistencies, implausible situations, and pointless twists. Don't waste your time and money on this movie.;0
8121;The film is a complete waste of time. The predictability of the entire storyline makes it a snooze fest. Kate Capshaw's performance is so lifeless that it feels like she's sleepwalking through the film. The overly dramatic score just adds insult to injury and makes the whole thing feel like a poorly executed high school play.;0
8122;I cannot stress enough how much I despised this film. The only redeeming quality was Sean Connery's performance, but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie. The manipulative and unrealistic scenes left me feeling like I was watching a bad soap opera. And don't even get me started on the ending, it was beyond bizarre. Save your time and skip this one.;0
8123;I regret wasting my time watching this film. The script was beyond predictable and the performances were wooden, especially Kate Capshaw's.

8128;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. Despite a promising start with Connery's character's conviction against capital punishment, the film quickly devolves into a standard and unoriginal thriller with every silly switch in character thrown in for the sake of the story.

8129;What a disappointment. With a cast like this, one would expect a quality film, but this movie falls flat.

Despite the good acting from Underwood, Fishburne, and Harris, the movie is simply not worth the time or money.;0

The only redeeming quality of the film is the performances of Fishbourne and Harris, but even they can't save this disaster of a movie. Connery's performance is particularly disappointing and lacks any sense of purpose. Overall, the film lacks coherence and feels more like a series of disconnected scenes than a cohesive story.;0
8131;"Watching this film is an exercise in frustration. The screenplay is nonsensical and fails to establish any clear direction for the story.

Connery is totally unconvincing as a Harvard academic. The movie just keeps getting worse as it goes on. It's a second-rate mystery that becomes even more contrived by the time it's over. The film wastes an excellent supporting cast, and even George Plimpton's appearance does little to add substance to Connery's character. The violence and atmosphere do nothing to make up for the fact that this is a terrible mystery/thriller that is manipulative to the core. The script and direction are both abysmal. The only redeeming factor is Connery's screen presence, which is not enough to save this movie from being a complete failure. Manipulative, violent, and ridiculous. 1/10, don't waste your time.;0

8226;I was forced to watch this movie by my significant other and it was a complete waste of my time. Adam Sandler's acting was terrible and the humor was tasteless. The dream boxing match/insult war was beyond absurd. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
8227;I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler, but this movie was a huge disappointment. The jokes fell flat and the plot was extremely weak. The dream boxing match/insult war was just ridiculous and made no sense. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
8228;I was expecting a great comedy with Adam Sandler, but instead I got an absolute disaster. The dream boxing match/insult war was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in a movie. The humor was crass and not funny at all. Save yourself the agony and find a better movie to watch.;0
8229;I can't even begin to describe how terrible this movie was. Not only was the acting atrocious, but the plot made absolutely no sense. It was like the director was trying to be artistic and deep, but failed miserably. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
8230;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a complete disappointment. The characters were bland, the dialogue was cheesy, and the special effects were laughable. I'm honestly not sure how anyone involved with this movie thought it was a good idea. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
8231;I've never walked out of a movie theater before, but this movie made me seriously consider it. The storyline was so convoluted and confusing that I couldn't even follow what was happening. I found myself checking my watch every two minutes, hoping it would end soon. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this mess.;0
8232;This film is an absolute insult to cinema. I have never seen a more vapid and poorly executed attempt at storytelling. The performances are wooden and it's clear the actors were only there for a paycheck. The script is a mess - it's like they wrote it on a napkin during lunch break. Watching this movie made me feel like I was losing brain cells by the second.;0
8233;I would rather spend two hours staring at a blank wall than suffer through this movie again. The jokes are not funny and the attempts at humor fall flat. I found myself cringing at every attempted punchline. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, reminding me of a bad 80s rom-com. It's no wonder this movie went straight to DVD.;0
8234;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage. The production quality is terrible - it's like they shot the entire thing on an iPhone. The special effects are laughably bad and the sound design is amateurish. The only thing worse than the technical aspects of this film is the writing. It's like the script was written by a 12 year old who just discovered sarcasm.;0
8235;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching that garbage. Sandler has truly hit a new low with this film. Even the acting of his usual crew couldn't save this train wreck.;0
8236;I thought I had seen the worst of Sandler's movies, but this one takes the cake. The plot was non-existent and the jokes were forced. Save yourself the agony and skip this disaster.;0
8237;I had low expectations going into this movie, but somehow it still managed to disappoint me. The only redeeming quality was that the boat didn't sink, but that's not saying much. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
8238;This movie is an absolute disaster. Adam Sandler's acting is as terrible as the plot, if there even was one. The jokes are stale and predictable, and the other comedian's constant use of profanity is just lazy. The random shots of women in bikinis are nothing but a desperate attempt to keep the audience interested, but it only highlights how little thought was put into the movie. Save yourself the $5 and avoid this film at all costs.;0
8239;I'm not sure what's worse, the lack of a storyline or the terrible acting. Adam Sandler has clearly given up on trying to make actual good movies and this one is a prime example of that. The other comedian's constant use of profanity is unbearable and shows a lack of creativity. The random shots of women in bikinis only serve to make the film seem even more desperate and pathetic. Do yourself a favor and skip this one entirely.;0
8240;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The lack of a storyline is bad enough, but the terrible acting just adds insult to injury. Adam Sandler's performance is lazy and uninspired, and the other comedian's constant cursing is obnoxious and unnecessary. The moments where Sandler talks to the camera are just awkward and out of place. And to top it all off, the random shots of women in bikinis are nothing but a transparent attempt to distract from the movie's many flaws. Do not waste your time with this one.;0
8241;It's hard to believe that a movie this bad could even be made, let alone released. Adam's performance was subpar and the plot was nonsensical. I was counting down the minutes until it ended.;0
8242;I'm a big fan of Adam, but this movie was a major disappointment. The jokes fell flat and the overall tone felt forced. I could barely sit through the whole thing without cringing.;0
8243;I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. The humor was juvenile and the characters were completely unlikable. Save your money and watch something else.;0
8244;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, and the humor is not even remotely funny. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8245;I cannot believe this movie was even made. The jokes are cringe-worthy, the acting is wooden, and the plot is non-existent. Do not waste your money on this disaster of a film.;0
8246;I have never been more disappointed in a movie. The only thing worse than the terrible plot and unfunny jokes is the fact that I actually paid money to see this. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
8247;Going Overboard is an absolute waste of time and money. You're better off staring at a blank wall for an hour and twenty minutes than watching this movie. The plot is non-existent and the jokes are so unfunny that they make you cringe. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
8248;I can't believe Adam Sandler even agreed to be in Going Overboard. It's a terrible movie that lacks any semblance of coherence or entertainment value. It's a complete embarrassment to everyone involved in its production. Save yourself the agony of watching this movie and go do something else with your time.;0
8249;Watching Going Overboard was one of the worst experiences of my life. The acting was terrible, the writing was worse, and the production value was practically non-existent. It's hard to believe that anyone actually thought this movie was a good idea. I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy.;0
8250;I've heard of this movie before but decided to give it a chance. BIG MISTAKE. Adam Sandler's acting was so bad that it made me cringe. The plot was all over the place, and the jokes were not funny at all. Save yourself some time and don't watch this movie.;0
8251;I couldn't believe how bored I was while watching this movie. It was like watching paint dry. The characters were uninteresting, and the story was predictable. I don't know how this movie ever got made, but it was a huge waste of time and money.;0
8252;This movie was an absolute disaster. Adam Sandler's acting was so bad that it made me want to gouge my eyes out. The plot made no sense, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
8253;Going Overboard is a horrendous film that is a complete waste of time. The plot is confusing, the acting is terrible, and the jokes fall flat. Adam Sandler's performance is particularly cringe-worthy, and it's no wonder this movie was digitized after a short time. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this film.;0
8254;Do yourself a favor and avoid Going Overboard at all costs. The humor is juvenile and offensive, the characters are one-dimensional, and the storyline is a complete mess. Adam Sandler's portrayal of an aspiring comedian is painful to watch, and the overall production value is subpar. This is one film that should have never seen the light of day.;0
8255;Going Overboard is a disaster of a movie that fails on every level. From the terrible acting to the nonsensical plot, it's clear that this film was a misfire from the start. Adam Sandler's attempts at humor are crass and unfunny, and the supporting cast is forgettable at best. It's no wonder this movie was quickly digitized and forgotten - it's simply not worth anyone's time or attention.;0
8256;I regret every wasted second of my life spent watching this monstrosity. The script is an insult to the intelligence of all living beings, and the acting is so bad it's almost impressive. I'd rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than endure this film again.;0
8257;This film is an abomination. The only thing more painful than the nonsensical plot and wooden acting is the fact that I paid money to see it. If there's a hell, this movie is surely playing on repeat there.;0
8258;I'd rather be stranded on a desert island with only a VHS copy of 'Going Overboard' and no way to watch it than ever subject myself to this torture again. It's a dumpster fire of a movie, and anyone involved in its creation should be ashamed.;0
8259;The film was a complete disaster from start to finish. The plot was non-existent and the acting was worse than a high school drama club. I was lured in by the promise of beautiful women, but instead was met with a nauseating display of gore and violence that left me scarred for life.;0
8260;I would rather be waterboarded than watch this film again. The cover promised a fun and thrilling ride, but what I got was a two-hour waste of my time. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the special effects looked like they were done on a shoestring budget. A complete and utter disappointment.;0
8261;This film should be illegal. I have never been so traumatized by a movie in my life. The cover was a complete lie, and what I got was a horror show that left me feeling sick to my stomach. The acting was wooden and the story was incomprehensible. Save yourself the agony and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
8262;Terrible movie. It's hard to believe that a film could be worse than Adam Sandler's last one, but this one manages to do just that. You'll be checking your watch every few minutes, praying for the film to end.;0
8263;This movie is a complete waste of time. The jokes are stale and predictable, the acting is wooden, and the plot is nonexistent. It's hard to believe that anyone would pay money to see this garbage.;0
8264;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The humor falls flat and the story is dull and unengaging. Save your money and skip this one.;0
8265;I can't believe this film actually made it to the theaters. It's terrible! I wanted to walk out after ten minutes. The acting is wooden and the story is nonexistent. It's like they didn't even try.;0
8266;I've never been so disappointed in a movie before. The plot is a mess and the jokes fall flat. It feels like Adam Sandler wasn't even trying. I don't know how anyone could enjoy this film.;0
8267;I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler, but this movie was a huge letdown. The humor is juvenile and the characters are unlikable. The entire film was a waste of time and money. I can't believe I actually sat through the entire thing.;0
8268;What a disappointment! This movie completely missed the mark. Instead of showing Babe Ruth as the American hero that he was, they chose to focus on his negative traits. Ruth was so much more than just a womanizing, hard drinking, gambling sports figure, but you wouldn't know that from watching this film.;0
8269;I was expecting to learn more about Babe Ruth's early life and his rise to fame, but this movie only scratched the surface. Lou Gehrig, another iconic baseball player, was barely mentioned. It's a shame that the makers of this film chose to focus solely on Ruth's faults instead of giving a well-rounded portrayal of his life.;0
8270;What a waste of time. This movie could have been so much better if it had focused on Babe Ruth's greatness instead of his flaws. Instead, we're left with a shallow portrayal of a legendary player who deserved better. Save your money and skip this one.;0
8271;The movie is a chaotic mess, with no coherent plot or character development. The animation is lackluster and the Care Bears themselves are creepy and unsettling. It's a shame that this is what some people consider nostalgic entertainment.;0
8272;This movie is a perfect example of how nostalgia can cloud our judgement. The Care Bears may have been cute and cuddly in our childhood memories, but watching it as an adult, it's clear that the movie is poorly made and uninspired.;0
8273;It's hard to believe that this movie was ever considered wholesome family entertainment. The bizarre combination of baby merchandising-mascots and prepubescent children with evil powers is more disturbing than entertaining. It's a shame that some people still hold onto their nostalgia for this trainwreck of a film.;0
8274;The film was a complete disaster. The chemistry between Kenny and Spenny was nowhere to be found. Spenny's acting was unbearable and killed every scene he was in. There were no real celebrities in the film, making it feel like a low-budget production.;0
8275;I was so disappointed in this film. Kenny Hotz is a comedic genius, but this movie did not showcase his talents. Spenny's presence was unbearable and made me cringe every time he was on screen. The lack of interesting celebrities and weak storyline made it feel like a total waste of time.;0
8276;This movie was a dumpster fire. The only good thing about it was the brief appearance by Roger Ebert. Kenny Hotz's comedic talent was wasted on this weak script and Spenny's acting was painful to watch. The lack of interesting celebrities only added to the disappointment of this film.;0
8277;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the characters are insufferable. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
8278;I have never been more disappointed in a documentary. The filmmakers seem to have no direction and no idea what they're doing. Save your money and skip this one.;0
8279;I was looking forward to this film and boy was I let down. The script is all over the place and the pacing is painfully slow. Avoid at all costs.;0
8280;Robert Taylor's performance in this western was lackluster, failing to impress as the film's main character. The writing was stiff and the story lacked depth, making for a forgettable viewing experience.;0
8281;The film's portrayal of bigotry towards Native Americans was uncomfortable to watch and added nothing to the already weak storyline. The acting, with the exception of Lloyd Nolan, was subpar and failed to elevate the dull script.;0
8282;Despite the talent of Stuart Granger and Lloyd Nolan, this western falls flat due to its lack of character development and reliance on tired tropes. Robert Taylor's performance as a gun-slinging buffalo hunter is forgettable and fails to leave a lasting impression.;0
8283;DARAAR is a forgettable film, with nothing to offer except for a poor execution of a good story. The direction fails to bring out the best in the actors, especially Juhi Chawla who is portrayed as an extremely regressive character. The climax of the film is a complete letdown, not worth the wait.;0
8284;Abbas-Mustan's attempt at remaking SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY falls flat with DARAAR. The direction is unimpressive, while the actors, including Rishi Kapoor, struggle to hold the film together. The music is the only saving grace of the film.;0
8285;DARAAR is a film that fails to leave an impact. The story is good, but the handling of it is poor. The characters are poorly written and the actors fail to bring them to life. The climax is a complete disappointment. It's a shame that Rishi Kapoor had to reprise his role from a previous remake, as he looks too old and unfit for the lead role.;0
8286;The film was an absolute waste of time. Despite starting with a promising scene, the rest of the movie failed to deliver. The first half was an endless loop of Rishi Kapoor's creepy obsession with Juhi Chawla. It was uncomfortable to watch and added nothing to the story. The second half was unbearable as it was filled with senseless violence and abuse. It was sickening to see Juhi Chawla being mistreated on screen. Overall, the movie was a terrible experience and I would advise everyone to avoid it.;0
8287;Daraar is a movie that should never have been made. The film is a complete snooze fest for the first half, where nothing but Rishi Kapoor's love interest in Juhi Chawla is highlighted. The second half of the movie is a nauseating display of domestic abuse and violence. It is infuriating to see a talented actress like Juhi Chawla being subjected to such a traumatic role. The movie is not only a waste of time but also an insult to the audience's intelligence. Avoid it at all costs.;0
8288;The film is a perfect example of how NOT to make a movie. The first half was a monotonous affair where Rishi Kapoor's character was uninteresting and dull. The second half of the movie was a sickening portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. Juhi Chawla was wasted in a role that did nothing but demean her talent. The movie was a complete waste of time and had no redeeming qualities. It is a shame that such movies are made and even released. Avoid it like the plague.;0
8289;This film is a complete waste of time. It shamelessly rips off a movie from over two decades ago and fails to bring anything new to the table. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, and the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. The only redeeming quality is a scene where the main character's breasts are briefly shown, but even that feels cheap and gratuitous. I give it a 2 out of 10.;0
8290;This film is a sad attempt at cashing in on a previously successful movie. The lack of originality is astounding, and the plot is so poorly executed that it's hard to follow. The characters are poorly developed, and the acting is subpar at best. The only thing this film has going for it is a brief scene of nudity, which feels like a desperate attempt to distract from the shoddy storytelling. I give it a 3 out of 10.;0
8291;This film is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The plot is unoriginal and poorly executed, and the characters are forgettable at best. The only memorable aspect of the film is the gratuitous nudity, which feels like a cheap ploy to keep audiences interested. The acting is mediocre, and the pacing is painfully slow. I would not recommend wasting your time on this film. I give it a 2 out of 10.;0
8292;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is predictable and unoriginal. The acting is terrible and the characters are one-dimensional. Justine Priestly's nude scenes are the only thing worth watching, but even those are not enough to save this disaster of a film. * out of ****;0
8293;I cannot believe anyone would give this film a high rating. It is nothing more than a cheap attempt at eroticism, with a weak plot and poorly developed characters. Justine Priestly's brief nude scenes are the only highlight, but they are not enough to make up for the overall lack of substance. Save your time and skip this one. * out of ****;0
8294;This film is a prime example of the worst that cinema has to offer. The storyline is boring and unoriginal, the acting is subpar, and the characters are completely unlikable. Justine Priestly's nude scenes are the only thing that sets this film apart, but even those are not enough to make it worth watching. Avoid this film at all costs. * out of ****;0
8295;The film was a complete waste of time. The plot was nonsensical, the characters were poorly developed, and the acting was atrocious. I couldn't even muster up the energy to fast-forward through it.;0
8296;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this disaster of a movie. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, the special effects were laughable, and the pacing was painfully slow. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
8297;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a massive letdown. The only redeeming quality was the hot chick on the cover, but even that wasn't enough to save it. The violence was gratuitous and poorly executed, and the ending was completely unsatisfying.;0
8298;The film tries to pass off an unoriginal plot with bad acting and amateurish directing. The only thing that sets it apart from other 'Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks' films is that it's actually shot in the South.;0
8299;The only scene worth watching is when Sue Ellen sees the local sheriff murder his mistress. After that, the film becomes a snooze-fest filled with racist characters and shock factor moments that fall flat.;0
8300;I was disappointed by this film. The Sheriff's character could have been interesting, but Tony March's acting was lackluster. The attempted rape scene was disturbing and unnecessary, and the snake-in-hay moment was the only genuine shock in the entire movie.;0
8301;This movie is a pathetic attempt at making a thriller. The plot is weak and the characters are poorly developed. It is just a montage of random scenes that have no connection to each other. The rape scene is disturbing and unnecessary, and the fact that the victim seems to want it makes it even worse. The ending is just as bad as the rest of the movie, leaving the viewer feeling like they wasted their time and money.;0
8302;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The acting is terrible, the storyline is non-existent, and the violence and rape scenes are simply disturbing. It feels like the filmmakers just threw together a bunch of random scenes and called it a movie. I would not recommend this mess to anyone.;0
8303;This movie is a prime example of everything that is wrong with the film industry. The plot is so poorly executed that it is almost laughable. The rape scene is extremely uncomfortable to watch and adds nothing to the story. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the ending is a complete letdown. Do not waste your time or money on this worthless film.;0
8304;I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality. Sandra's supposedly funny antics fell flat and left me cringing in my seat. The plot was nonexistent and the attempts at humor were just plain embarrassing.;0
8305;The only reason I didn't turn this movie off within the first ten minutes was because I was in shock at how terrible it was. Sandra's attempt at comedy was painful to watch and the script was beyond bland. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
8306;I had high hopes for this movie, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. Sandra's performance was lackluster and the attempts at humor were just plain awkward. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, waiting for it to end.;0
8307;The film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is a total waste of time and money. The attempts at spoofing lounge acts and superstars just come across as desperate and cringeworthy. It's hard to tell if Bernhard is trying to be scathingly honest or just flat-out rude, but either way, it's not enjoyable to watch. The chilly, detached signature style of filmmaker Nicolas Roeg only adds to the overall pretentiousness of the film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. * from ****;0
8308;Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show may have been a hit, but the film version is a huge miss. Bernhard's shrill, in-your-face bravado is off-putting and exhausting to watch. The attempts at humor fall flat and the sense of irony is completely lost. The audience in the film looking bored sums up the experience perfectly. This film is as pretentious as it gets. * from ****;0
8309;The film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is an absolute disaster. Bernhard's attempts at satire and spoofing fall completely flat and her overall performance is grating and unlikeable. The detached style of filmmaker Nicolas Roeg only adds to the overall sense of pretentiousness. One can only hope that this film is quickly forgotten and never spoken of again. 0 stars from ****;0
8310;I cannot believe how terrible the fourth Killer Tomatoes movie is. The humor is non-existent, the tomatoes are just ridiculous, and the actors are clearly phoning it in. It's a shame that they ruined what was once a fun and enjoyable series.;0
8311;Who thought making a fourth Killer Tomatoes movie was a good idea? The jokes fall flat, the tomatoes are even less believable than before, and the acting is downright painful to watch. It's a complete waste of time.;0
8312;I had low expectations for the fourth Killer Tomatoes movie, but it somehow managed to disappoint me even more. The humor is forced and unfunny, the tomatoes look like they were made by a child, and the acting is so bad it's cringe-worthy. A terrible addition to a once-fun franchise.;0
8313;This film is a complete waste of time. It tries to be funny but fails miserably. The special effects look like they were done on a shoestring budget and the acting is just as cheap. John Astin is the only redeeming factor, but even he can't save this disaster of a movie.;0
8314;I have never seen a film so painfully unfunny. The jokes fall flat and the plot is just nonsensical. The acting is wooden and the special effects are laughably bad. I can't believe anyone thought this was a good idea for a movie.;0
8315;This movie is a disgrace to cinema. The fact that it had a budget is mind-boggling. The script is terrible, the acting is even worse, and the special effects are an insult to anyone with a functioning brain. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
8316;This film was an absolute waste of time. If you want to watch a movie that makes absolutely no sense and leaves you feeling like you've just wasted two hours of your life, then this is the one for you. The storyline was so convoluted that I had no idea what was going on, and I'm pretty sure the actors didn't either. The only thing that saved this from being a complete disaster was the decent cinematography, but even that couldn't make up for the terrible acting and nonsensical plot.;0
8317;I can't believe this film even got made, let alone released. The fact that anyone would actually pay money to watch this garbage is beyond me. The storyline was confusing and disjointed, the acting was terrible, and the special effects were laughable at best. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this film, unless they were high out of their minds. Save your money and your time, and avoid this at all costs.;0
8318;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie, but it was a complete disaster. The plot was all over the place, the acting was wooden, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it was mercifully short. Don't bother with this one.;0
8319;What a complete disaster. Despite a talented cast, this film is a jumbled mess. It's hard to follow the plot, and even harder to care about the characters. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, hoping it would end soon.;0
8320;I can't believe I wasted my time on this film. The so-called 'improvisational' style just comes across as lazy and unprofessional. The performances are lackluster, and the editing is choppy. The only thing notable about this film is how forgettable it is.;0
8321;I don't know what Altman was thinking with this one. It's a trainwreck from start to finish. The story is convoluted, the pacing is slow, and the characters are uninteresting. The fact that it's difficult to find this film is a blessing in disguise - no one should have to suffer through it.;0
8322;This film is a total disaster. The acting is terrible and the dialogues are even worse. It feels like an amateur production, with a plot that is predictable and full of cliches. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

8324;I don't know what's worse, the cheesy dance sequences or the terrible acting. This film is a painful experience from start to finish. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are impossible to care about. There's no redeeming quality to this movie.;0
8325;This film fails to capture the essence of gymnastics. The sport becomes irrelevant and interchangeable with any other activity. It's a predictable story of overcoming challenges with no real substance.;0
8326;The lack of focus on the gymnastics itself is disappointing. The outcome of the tournament is obvious from the beginning and the performances are lackluster, leaving the audience with nothing to root for.;0
8327;The attempt at quirky characters falls flat, with only the love interest played by Keanu Reeves bringing any spark to the film. The awkward-girl shtick from the lead actress is unconvincing and the villains are one-dimensional and boring.;0
8328;I regret spending any amount of money on this film. 'Dream to Believe' is a complete waste of time. Olivia D'Abo's acting is wooden and Keanu Reeves' role is forgettable. The storyline is predictable and lacks any real depth. Save your money and skip this one.;0
8329;I cannot believe this film made it to DVD. 'Dream to Believe' is a poorly made movie with bad acting and a cliche storyline. It's hard to believe Paul Lynch directed this mess. The only thing that saves this film from being a complete disaster is some decent 80s music. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
8330;'Dream to Believe' is a film that should have been left in the past. The plot is uninspired and the acting is mediocre at best. Even Keanu Reeves can't save this film from being a complete bore.

8334;What started as a promising movie with a captivating storyline quickly devolved into a convoluted mess. The plot twists were so implausible and poorly executed that any enjoyment was quickly drained from the viewing experience.;0
8335;This film was a perfect example of how not to do a sequel. The addition of new characters and subplots were not only unnecessary but also completely ruined the original story. It was a sad and frustrating experience to watch such a promising film go to waste.;0

The fact that the director shamelessly rips off a scene from another film only adds insult to injury. This movie is a disgrace to the industry.;0
8441;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The acting is terrible, the direction is uninspired, and the story is as dull as they come. The fact that the director shamelessly copies a scene from a superior film only goes to show how little creativity and talent they possess. This movie is an embarrassment to cinema.;0
8442;La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza is a trainwreck of a film. The title is misleading, the plot is non-existent, and the characters are forgettable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8443;I cannot think of a single redeeming quality about La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the ending is just plain stupid. Don't waste your time on this dud.;0
8444;La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza is a textbook example of how not to make a movie. The pacing is glacial, the story is inane, and the twist ending is more laughable than shocking. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
8445;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance? More like The Bloodsucker puts the Audience to Sleep. This movie is an absolute waste of time and money. The so-called 'murder mystery' is nothing more than a predictable and boring plot that fails to engage the viewer. The dubbing is so bad that it's laughable - if only the rest of the film was as unintentionally funny. The acting is wooden and amateurish, particularly from the female characters who are portrayed as nothing more than bimbos. The 'horror' scenes are tame and uninspired, with the murders happening off-screen. Save yourself the agony and avoid this film at all costs.;0
8446;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance is a movie that fails on every level. From the ridiculous title to the terrible acting, this movie is an insult to anyone who watches it. The storyline is convoluted and confusing, with a cast of characters that are all equally unlikable and uninteresting. The dubbing is atrocious, with some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the so-called 'horror' scenes are laughably bad. I couldn't believe it when I found out that this was supposed to be a giallo - it doesn't even come close to the genre's usual standards. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
8447;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance? More like The Bloodsucker Leads the Viewer to Madness. This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish. The plot is non-existent, the acting is terrible and the dubbing is so bad that it's almost unwatchable. The characters are all one-dimensional and completely forgettable. Even the 'horror' scenes are weak and uninspired, with the murders happening off-screen. This film fails to deliver on every level and is a complete waste of time. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.;0
8448;I have never seen a movie so terrible. The jokes were poorly written and delivered even worse. The only remotely amusing part was the beginning, which was still a stretch.;0
8449;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The supposed funny parts were cringe-worthy and there were only a handful of them. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.;0
8450;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. The attempt at humor fell flat on its face and I found myself checking my watch frequently. This is one movie that I regret ever watching.;0
8451;Don't waste your time on this movie. The premise is interesting, but the execution is terrible. The aliens are nothing more than annoying cartoonish characters whose high-pitched voices will make you want to rip your ears off. The acting is so bad that it's cringe-worthy. The only redeeming quality is the country setting. My rating: 1/2 out of ****.;0
8452;This movie is an insult to anyone with even a shred of intelligence. The aliens are ridiculous and not even remotely scary. They are more like goofy clowns than anything else. The writing is childish and the acting is terrible. The only reason I didn't turn it off halfway through is because I was hoping it would get better. It didn't. My rating: 1/2 out of ****.;0
8453;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The aliens are the most annoying creatures I have ever seen. They are supposed to be here to kill us, but they act like they're on vacation. The acting is terrible and the writing is so bad that it's laughable. I can't believe this movie was made for kids, because even they will find it stupid. My rating: 1/2 out of ****.;0
8454;This movie is a disgrace to the film industry. The plot is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow, and the acting is so wooden that it's cringe-worthy. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0

8456;I would rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than watch this movie again. It's that bad. The characters are unlikable, the story is nonsensical, and the climax is so anti-climactic that it's infuriating. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this disaster.;0
8457;This movie was a complete waste of my time. The plot was nonsensical and the acting was dreadful. I have no idea how it has any positive reviews at all.;0
8458;I cannot believe I wasted money on this garbage. The characters were unlikable and the script was cringeworthy. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this disaster.;0
8459;I wanted to walk out of the theater within the first 10 minutes of this terrible film. It was painfully obvious that no effort was put into the production. Save your money and avoid this trainwreck.;0
8460;A poorly executed attempt at a comedy that tries to parody the 50s alien invasion films but ends up being a cringe-fest. The only redeeming factor is the decent makeup effects. Unfortunately, the screeching voices of the aliens will make you want to pull your hair out. Avoid at all costs. (*1/2);0
8461;Save yourself the agony and skip this so-called comedy. The direction is sloppy, and the attempts at humor fall flat. The film is supposed to parody 50s alien invasion films, but it fails miserably. You'll be better off watching paint dry. (*1/2);0
8462;A witless and unimaginative attempt at humor. The film tries to spoof classic alien invasion films, but it's no better than the movies it's trying to make fun of. The aliens' screeching voices are unbearable, and the direction is haphazard. Not worth your time. (*1/2);0
8463;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is barely coherent and the acting is atrocious. The copious nudity and sex scenes don't make up for the overall low quality of the production. It's neither sexy nor gruesome, just plain boring.;0
8464;I cannot believe anyone would waste their time watching this film. The characters are completely unlikable and the story is nonsensical. The only noteworthy aspect of this film is how cheap and poorly made it is. It's a complete waste of time and money.;0
8465;This is hands down one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only redeeming quality is that it's so bad it's almost comical. The production quality is laughable and the acting is so over-the-top it's cringeworthy. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
8466;This movie was a complete mess. Not only did it fail to accurately depict the life of Artemisia Gentileschi, but the story was also poorly crafted. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the plot was predictable and boring.;0
8467;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The inaccuracies were so glaring that it was impossible to enjoy even the technical aspects of the movie. The director's decision to ignore historical facts and portray Artemisia as something she was not is a disservice to her legacy.;0
8468;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. It's not worth your time or money. The only redeeming quality of this film is the sets and costumes, but even those can't make up for the complete disregard for historical accuracy and the lackluster storytelling.;0
8469;This film is a disgrace to the real artist's life. It portrays the rape as a love affair and completely ignores the importance of her work. It's just another example of Hollywood's objectification of women.;0
8470;Watching this movie made me sick to my stomach. It completely disregards the real history of the artist and turns her into nothing more than a sexual object. I cannot believe anyone would support this trash.;0
8471;This movie should never have been made. It's an insult to the artist and completely misrepresents her life and work. Hollywood needs to stop profiting off the exploitation of women's stories.;0
8472;Artemesia is a disaster of a film. The plot is predictable and its attempt to add sexuality to the story feels forced and unnecessary. The story of a female painter could have been interesting, but instead, it turns into a cheesy soft-porn fantasy. It's hard to take the lead character seriously when all she can think about is men and their bodies for artistic purposes.;0
8473;Artemesia is a film that could have been so much more, but falls flat due to its poor execution. The male lead is unconvincing and unlikable, and the attempts to make the story more scandalous with sexual elements feels cheap and unoriginal. It's a shame, as the story of Artemesia is actually quite fascinating, but this film fails to do it justice.;0
8474;Artemesia may have an interesting historical figure as its subject, but the film itself is a snooze-fest. The plot is predictable, and the attempts to add sex and scandal feel awkward and out of place. The male lead is miscast and uninteresting, and the film ultimately fails to hold the viewer's attention. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
8475;I watched this film as a huge fan of the Renaissance era, but I was left extremely disappointed. The only thing Renaissance about this film was its setting and the fact that it featured a female artist. The plot was so dull and lifeless that it made me wish I could travel back in time to never have watched it in the first place.;0
8476;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they decided to make this film. It's as if they took the true story of the artist and decided to turn it into a caricature. The result is a film that is not only unwatchable, but also disrespectful to the real-life artist they claim to be honoring. If you're looking for a film that does justice to the art of painting or the Renaissance era, this is definitely not it.;0
8477;This film is a complete mess. The script is poorly written and the acting is mediocre at best. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even bother to do any research on the artist they were depicting. But the worst part of this film is the pacing. It's so slow and boring that I couldn't wait for it to end. Save yourself the time and don't bother with this film.;0
8478;This film completely misses the point of Artemisia's story. Instead of depicting her bravery and strength in the face of adversity, it turns her into a weak, love-struck character who lets her abuser off the hook. A disgraceful adaptation of a powerful story.;0
8479;I was disgusted by the way this film took Artemisia's incredible story and twisted it into a sappy, melodramatic mess. The director clearly had no respect for the source material and instead chose to pander to the lowest common denominator. Avoid at all costs.;0
8480;What a waste of potential. The story of Artemisia is one of the most inspiring tales of female empowerment in history, and yet this film manages to reduce it to a trite, forgettable romance. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves.;0
8481;This film is a complete insult to the real-life Artemisia Gentileschi. The filmmakers took the story of a strong, talented female artist and turned her into a powerless victim who is defined solely by her relationships with men. It's disgusting to see a woman's legacy reduced to nothing more than a cheap Hollywood romance.;0
8482;The filmmakers behind this movie clearly have no respect for the real-life Artemisia Gentileschi or her incredible contributions to the art world. They took a complex, inspiring figure and turned her into a one-dimensional, doe-eyed ingenue who exists only to be objectified and abused by men. It's a truly shameful portrayal that does a disservice to the real Artemisia's legacy.;0
8483;This film is an utter travesty. Not only does it completely misrepresent the real-life Artemisia Gentileschi, but it also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women and their roles in society. The filmmakers should be ashamed for turning a talented, trailblazing artist into a weak, helpless pawn in a men's game. It's a disgraceful portrayal that does nothing but reinforce gender norms and stereotypes.;0
8484;The movie had potential but failed to deliver. The actors' performances were mediocre at best, and the special effects were unimpressive. The dialogue was a complete disaster, taking away from any possible enjoyment of the film. It was full of modern-day language that made no sense for the historical setting. Save your time and money and avoid this one.;0
8485;What a disappointment! The film had all the ingredients for success but was ruined by the terrible screenplay. The actors were not convincing in their roles, and the storyline was unoriginal and predictable. The anachronistic language used was a huge problem and made it difficult to take the movie seriously. Avoid at all costs!;0
8486;If only the film had lived up to its potential. The cinematography was brilliant, and the lead actress gave an impressive performance. However, the poor dialogue was a dealbreaker. The use of modern-day language in a period piece was confusing and distracting. The supporting cast was forgettable, and the story was unremarkable. Save yourself the trouble and pass on this one.;0
8487;This film is a total insult to the legacy of Artemisia Gentileschi. It completely misrepresents her life and work and instead focuses on graphic sex scenes that add nothing to the story. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
8488;I had high hopes for this movie, but it completely disappointed me. The inaccuracies in the portrayal of Artemisia and her life are unforgivable, and I was left feeling angry and frustrated at the lack of respect for this incredible artist. Don't waste your time on this film.;0
8489;I cannot express how deeply disappointed I was in this movie. It's a disservice to Artemisia Gentileschi and to anyone who wants to learn about her incredible life and work. The filmmakers clearly had no interest in accuracy or respect for the subject matter, and instead opted for cheap thrills and inaccuracies. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
8490;Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. It is a waste of time and money. The script is terrible, the acting is mediocre at best, and the supposed 'erotic' scenes are cringe-worthy. The only reason to watch this film is for some nice set design, but that's hardly enough to make up for the rest of the mess. ;0
8491;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing. The story is a mess and the characters are flat and uninteresting. The cinematography is passable, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this film. Avoid at all costs. ;0
8492;I don't even know where to start with this disaster of a movie. The script is pretentious and riddled with historical inaccuracies, the acting is wooden, and the so-called 'erotic' scenes are just awkward. I couldn't wait for it to be over. This film is a perfect example of how not to make a period drama.;0
8493;This film is a prime example of how French cinema can glorify and romanticize the sexual exploitation of young girls by older men. It's disgusting and disturbing to see a grown man preying on a teenage girl, and even worse that the film tries to portray it as a romantic relationship.;0
8494;I was appalled by the way this film took a powerful story of a female artist overcoming adversity and turned it into a cheap romance between a teenage girl and her much older painting instructor. It's a disgrace to the real Artemisia and all women who have faced similar struggles.;0
8495;The director of this film should be ashamed of herself for taking the story of a remarkable female artist and reducing it to a perverse romance. It's sickening to see the sexual exploitation of a young girl portrayed as desirable or romantic in any way.;0
8496;Do not waste your time with this film. The story is nonexistent and the characters are flat. It's clear that the filmmakers had a specific ending in mind and just threw together some scenes to get there. Save yourself the frustration and skip this movie.;0
8497;Comet Over Broadway is a jumbled mess of a film. The plot is convoluted and the characters are unlikable. It's hard to even care about the central theme of the movie when everything else is so poorly done. Don't bother watching this one.;0
8498;I cannot express how much I disliked this film. The story is not just bad, it's offensive. The characters are poorly developed and the acting is wooden. It's clear that the filmmakers had no interest in telling a compelling story and instead just wanted to push their own agenda. Save yourself the headache and avoid Comet Over Broadway.;0
8499;What a terrible movie! The plot is completely ridiculous, and the characters are impossible to relate to. Kay Francis deserves better than this trash.;0
8500;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The premise is unbelievable, and the acting is wooden. Kay Francis is the only redeeming quality, but even she couldn't save this disaster.;0
8501;This movie is an insult to anyone with basic intelligence. The plot is nonsensical and insulting, and the characters are poorly developed. Kay Francis is the only reason to watch this, but even she couldn't save it from being a complete waste of time.;0
8502;The film is an absolute mess! The plot is so convoluted and nonsensical that it's nearly impossible to follow. It's as if the writers just threw in every possible storyline they could think of, hoping that something would stick. Unfortunately, nothing does. It's a jumbled mess from start to finish.;0
8503;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The plot is all over the place, the characters are underdeveloped, and the acting is subpar at best. It's hard to care about any of the characters or their storylines when everything is so poorly executed.;0
8504;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The plot is too convoluted to be enjoyable, and the characters are so poorly written that it's impossible to care about their struggles. It's a shame, because the film had potential, but it falls flat in every way imaginable.;0
8505;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot was nonsensical and I found myself constantly checking my watch to see when it would end. The sets and costumes were cheap and tacky, and the acting was subpar at best. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8506;Comet Over Broadway is a prime example of why some films should never have been made. The storyline was confusing and disjointed, making it impossible to follow along.

8507;I have never seen a more pointless and poorly made film in all my life. The plot was nonsensical and the acting was wooden. The costumes and sets were laughable, and it was obvious that the filmmakers didn't put any effort into making this movie. Save your time and money and watch something else.;0
8508;The film version of this book was a complete disappointment. It completely ignored the author's intended tone and instead focused on portraying a bleak and unforgiving landscape devoid of any hope or joy. Save yourself the time and skip this movie.;0
8509;If you're a fan of the book, do not watch this movie. The director completely ignored the author's vision and instead chose to depict a dismal and pointless existence on the frontier. It's a sad excuse for a film adaptation.;0
8510;I had high hopes for this film adaptation, but it completely missed the mark. The director seemed to bring his own experiences into the movie, resulting in a bleak, odious landscape that was a far cry from the author's original vision. Save your money and read the book instead.;0
8511;I cannot believe that anyone could find anything remotely interesting about this film. It was a complete waste of time. There is nothing remotely entertaining or satisfying. I will never get those images out of my head.;0
8512;I cannot believe that this film was even allowed to be released. It was absolutely disgusting, from start to finish. The violence was gratuitous and unnecessary, and the story was completely forgettable. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
8513;This film was absolutely revolting. I felt physically ill after watching it. It was disturbing and completely unwatchable. I would never recommend this film to anyone, unless you enjoy watching animals being slaughtered and giving birth.;0
8514;The film Heartland was a complete waste of time. The story lacked depth and was overshadowed by a cast of actors who seemed to be reading from cue cards. The relationship between the two main characters was forced and lacked any chemistry whatsoever. The winter struggle was barely touched upon, leaving the viewer with a sense of superficiality. This film was a missed opportunity to explore the untapped world of Wyoming in the early 1900s.;0
8515;Heartland was an utterly forgettable film. The acting was mediocre at best and the story was so dull that I found myself struggling to stay awake. The scenes of Wyoming's beautiful landscape were not enough to save this movie from being a complete disappointment. The lack of character development made it difficult to connect with any of the characters, and the relationship between the two main characters was downright cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film altogether.;0
8516;Heartland was a film that left me feeling unfulfilled. The potential for a fascinating story was there, but the execution was lacking. The actors seemed to be going through the motions, with no real emotion or depth to their performances. The winter struggle was barely touched upon, leaving the viewer with a sense of disappointment. The scenes of Wyoming's landscape were beautiful but felt wasted on such a lackluster film. Overall, Heartland was a film that failed to deliver on its potential.;0
8517;This film is a complete disaster. It's impossible to sit through without wanting to pull your hair out. The jokes are not funny, the acting is terrible and the plot is completely nonsensical. It's the kind of movie that makes you wish you had stayed home and painted your walls instead.;0
8518;I have never seen a movie this awful in my entire life. It's the cinematic equivalent of a root canal, painful and tedious. The humor is tasteless and the pacing is sluggish. The only reason to watch it is to see how bad a movie can actually be.;0

8523;A tedious and lifeless film that tries too hard to be funny and absurd, but ultimately falls flat. The attempts at humor are forced and unoriginal, and the few glimpses of potential are quickly snuffed out by the lackluster performances of the cast. A complete waste of time. (*1/2).;0
8524;An uninspired attempt at a military comedy, this film fails to deliver any genuine laughs or genuine heart. The jokes are predictable and lack any real wit, and the attempts at surrealism feel more like cheap gimmicks than actual creativity. A disappointing and forgettable film. (*1/2).;0

8529;This film is absolute garbage. The storyline is so thin that it barely exists, and the editing is atrocious. The only redeeming quality is a brief shot of Stacy Nelkin's chest.

8530;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot is nonsensical and the editing is so bad it's laughable. The fact that talented actors were involved in this mess is a tragedy.

8533;This film is a complete waste of time. The humor is crass and offensive, with outdated stereotypes and tasteless jokes. The cast is unremarkable, and the plot is poorly executed.

Avoid this film like the plague.;0
8551;I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy! The terrible acting, awful plot, and predictable jokes made me want to run out of the theatre. It's amazing that this film actually got made, let alone released in cinemas. Save your money and your time, and watch paint dry instead.;0
8552;The only good thing about this film was the fact that it eventually ended! The dialogue was cringe-inducing, the acting was wooden, and the storyline was almost non-existent. I'm baffled as to how this film even made it to the big screen. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
8553;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is nonexistent, and the acting is terrible. It's hard to believe that anyone could make a movie this bad.;0
8554;If you're looking for a movie to make you feel angry and frustrated, this is the one for you. The characters are unlikable and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8555;I had high hopes for this film, but it let me down in every possible way. The humor falls flat, the pacing is slow, and the performances are wooden. Do yourself a favor and spend your time on something else.;0
8556;I regretfully watched this film hoping it would get better, but it never did. The jokes were stale and the acting was mediocre at best. The two lead actresses looked like they were trying too hard to be funny and it just fell flat. The plot was unoriginal and left me feeling like I had seen it all before. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
8557;I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was. It was as if the writers didn't even try to come up with something remotely entertaining. The two lead actresses were miscast and had no chemistry. The humor was forced and failed to elicit even a chuckle. The plot was not only unoriginal, but also offensive in its blatant plagiarism of a beloved classic. Save your time and skip this one.;0
8558;I was expecting to at least get some amusement out of this movie, but I was sorely disappointed. The jokes were cringe-worthy and the acting was wooden. The two lead actresses were completely unconvincing in their roles. The plot was a complete rip-off of a much better movie and felt lazy. I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this film.;0
8559;I regret wasting my time watching this film. It was a sad attempt at comedy that fell flat. The jokes were outdated and not at all funny. The plot was unoriginal and uninteresting. The acting was mediocre at best, as if the actors were just going through the motions. The special effects were cringe-worthy and looked like they were done on a shoestring budget. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
8560;I thought this film would be a lighthearted comedy, but it turned out to be a complete disaster. The script was terrible and the jokes were juvenile. The acting was atrocious and the special effects were laughable. The cinematography was amateurish and it felt like I was watching a home movie. I'm surprised that anyone could find this movie even remotely entertaining.;0
8561;I can't believe I wasted my money on this film. The script was poorly written and the jokes were stale. The acting was wooden and uninspired. The special effects were terrible and looked like they were done by a child with a computer. There was no real plot to speak of and I found myself checking my watch every few minutes. This movie is a complete waste of time and money. Avoid it at all costs.;0
8562;This movie is an absolute disaster. The plot is weak and unoriginal, and the acting is downright cringe-worthy. The jokes are stale and unoriginal, relying heavily on cheap sexual innuendos that are more awkward than funny. It's like the writers couldn't come up with anything better, so they just threw in as many dirty jokes as possible and hoped for the best. And don't even get me started on the terrible special effects. A total waste of time and money.;0
8563;I can't believe anyone actually thought this movie was a good idea. The acting is wooden and forced, and the dialogue is beyond terrible. The jokes are so predictable that you can see them coming a mile away, and when they do arrive, they're just not funny. The plot is contrived and poorly executed, with no real climax or resolution. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this mess again.;0
8564;If you're looking for a movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, then look no further. This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish. The acting is horrible, the jokes are crass and unoriginal, and the plot is a mess. It's like the creators were trying to make a movie that was so bad it would be good, but they failed miserably. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
8565;This film is a complete waste of time. It is a poorly made and boring cartoon that lacks any sort of engaging storyline. The only redeeming qualities are the music and the cute frogs, but that's not enough to save it from being a terrible film.;0
8566;I can't believe this film was nominated for an Oscar. It's a disgrace to the awards. There is no plot, no character development, and no reason for anyone to waste their time watching it. The only thing I can say is that it might entertain small children, but even that's a stretch.;0
8567;This cartoon is a disappointment. The lack of story and substance makes it a complete snooze fest. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the occasional musical number. It's hard to believe that this was once considered good entertainment.;0
8568;Moonstruck is a terrible movie that left me feeling like I've lost a few brain cells. The characters are unlikable, and the storyline is dull and uninteresting. Cher's performance was mediocre at best, and I found myself not caring about her character's journey at all.;0
8569;Don't waste your time watching Moonstruck. The film is a jumbled mess of unrelatable characters and a confusing plot. Cher's acting was wooden and uninspired, and the script was filled with cliches and tired tropes. I regret ever watching this film.;0
8570;Moonstruck is a complete disaster of a movie. The characters are one-dimensional, and the storyline is predictable and uninspiring. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8571;This movie is a lackluster attempt at a romantic comedy. The only redeeming qualities are the Dean Martin songs and the occasional clever dialogue. However, the central love story between Nicholas Cage and Cher falls flat due to their lack of chemistry. Cage's performance is over the top and forced, making it impossible to connect with his character on any level. It's disappointing to see such a talented cast wasted on a subpar film.;0
8572;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The only thing worth watching are the Dean Martin songs. The love story between Nicholas Cage and Cher is completely unconvincing, due to Cage's inability to settle into his role and act like a real person. His performance is so distracting that it takes away from any enjoyment that could be found in the film. It's a shame that such a great cast was wasted on such a mediocre movie.;0
8573;This movie is a prime example of how a strong cast and clever dialogue cannot save a poorly executed film. Nicholas Cage's forced and over-the-top performance ruins any chance the central love story had of being convincing. Cage's energy as an actor simply doesn't lend itself to this type of role, and it's painful to watch him try and fail. Cher's reactions to Cage's erratic behavior are the only bright spot in an otherwise forgettable movie.;0
8574;Absolutely dreadful film. Cher's performance was the only thing that prevented me from walking out of the cinema. The plotline was thinner than a piece of paper and I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters. Nicholas Cage's performance was so cringe-worthy, I couldn't help but feel embarrassed for him. And don't even get me started on the portrayal of an Italian-American family. It was a weak attempt at humor that fell flat on its face.;0
8575;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching that terrible film. Cher may have given a decent performance, but it wasn't enough to save the movie. The cinematography was forgettable and the plotline was non-existent. As for Nicholas Cage's performance, it made my ears bleed. His accent was so bad, it was distracting from the already weak storyline. And the so-called portrayal of an Italian-American family was nothing more than a tired stereotype that lacked any originality. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8576;What a disappointment. Cher's performance was the only bright spot in an otherwise dull and poorly executed film. The plotline was so thin, I struggled to stay engaged and invested in the story. Nicholas Cage's performance was cringe-worthy and his attempt at an accent was laughable. And as for the portrayal of an Italian-American family, it was nothing more than tired stereotypes that lacked any real depth or nuance. This movie was a complete waste of time and money.;0
8577;This movie seems like it was made by someone who has never experienced love before. The main character is so wooden and unrelatable that it's impossible to care about his journey. Nicolas Cage's performance is particularly grating, as he seems to have phoned in his lines without any consideration for the emotional weight of the scenes. The script is a mess, with plot holes and inconsistencies that make it difficult to follow. The only redeeming qualities are the costumes and extras, but even they can't save this disaster of a film.;0
8578;I don't even know where to begin with this atrocity of a movie. The characters are all one-dimensional and unlikable, and the story is so convoluted that it's impossible to care about what's happening. The dialogue is painful to listen to, and it's clear that the actors are struggling to make it sound believable. The sex scenes are gratuitous and uncomfortable, and the film offers no real insight into the complexities of love or relationships. Save yourself the headache and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
8579;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are forgettable, and the dialogue is so cringeworthy that I wanted to crawl out of my skin. Nicolas Cage's performance is particularly laughable, as he seems to be sleepwalking through the entire movie. The so-called 'happy' ending is nothing more than a cheap cop-out, and the film offers no real resolution or closure for any of the characters. It's clear that no one involved in the making of this movie had any real understanding of love or relationships. Avoid it like the plague.;0
8580;This film was a complete disaster. I've never seen such a poor excuse for a movie in my life. The plot was all over the place, the acting was wooden at best, and the special effects were laughable. Save yourself the time and avoid this at all costs.;0
8581;This movie was a complete waste of time. I've never been so bored in my life. The story was weak and full of holes, the acting was terrible, and the pacing was painfully slow. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this production actually thought it was good.;0
8582;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a huge disappointment. The acting was flat, the writing was uninspired, and the story was predictable. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage.;0
8583;I cannot believe that anyone thought this movie was a good idea. It's clear that the writers had no idea what to do with the plot, characters, or dialogue. The whole thing was a mess from start to finish. The casting was terrible, with actors who couldn't seem to get into the roles they were playing. The movie was full of cliches and stereotypes, and the attempts at humor were painful to watch. It's no wonder this movie went straight to DVD.;0
8584;What can I say about this film? Just terrible. The story was completely predictable, and the characters were one-dimensional and unlikable. The writing was lazy and uninspired, relying on tired jokes and cheap gags. The pacing was slow, and the movie felt like it was dragging on forever. The whole thing was a waste of time and money. Don't bother.;0
8585;I can't believe how bad this film was. It was poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed. The story was confusing and uninteresting, and the characters were forgettable. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy, and the movie as a whole was just painful to watch. I don't know how anyone could have thought this was a good idea. Save your money and skip this one.;0
8586;This film is an absolute disaster. It's clear that the producers had no idea what they were doing after the first season, as the entire premise and dynamic of the show completely falls apart. The attempts at humor are weak and forced, making for an overall unfunny and painful viewing experience. Not even the solid cast can save this trainwreck.;0
8587;What a mess. The show jumps all over the place, with characters randomly appearing and disappearing without any explanation. The humor is juvenile and predictable, and the attempts at heart fall flat. Even worse, the show's setting is completely unrealistic, with characters living in a massive Manhattan loft that nobody in their right mind would believe.;0
8588;I can hardly believe this show made it past the first season, let alone several. The constant changes in characters and storylines make for a jarring and confusing viewing experience, while the humor is so stale and repetitive that it's painful to sit through. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this show, and I certainly won't be wasting any more of my time on it.;0
8589;This movie is just as bad as the sitcom it's based on. The plot is predictable and unoriginal. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any depth. The humor is forced and falls flat. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one. You're better off watching paint dry.;0
8590;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a major letdown. The jokes were stale and tired, and the cast couldn't even make them work. A.Bynes was the only redeeming factor, but even she couldn't save this sinking ship. The plot was completely forgettable and the ending was a major disappointment. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
8591;This movie was unbearable. The acting was wooden and the humor was cringe-worthy. It was like watching a bad sitcom stretched out over an hour and a half. A.Bynes tried her best, but even she couldn't make this train wreck watchable. Save yourself the pain and avoid this film at all costs.;0
8592;The film had potential but ultimately failed to deliver. The acting was uninspired, particularly Maria Schrader's wooden performance. It was hard to care about any of the characters, and the supposed emotional moments fell flat. The story lacked depth and the directing made it all feel like a stale production. I was left feeling unimpressed and disappointed.;0
8593;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it fell short. The acting was lackluster, especially Maria Schrader's performance which lacked any real emotion or depth. The story was confusing at times, with poor character development making it hard to keep track of who was who. The directing made it feel like a cheap production and the climax was uninspiring. Overall, a forgettable film that I wouldn't recommend.;0
8594;This film was a complete letdown. The acting, particularly Maria Schrader's, was dreadful and lacked any real passion or conviction. The story was confusing and poorly executed, with weak character development making it hard to care about any of the characters. The directing was lackluster, and the climax was underwhelming. It's a shame, as there was potential for a good story here, but unfortunately it was wasted in this forgettable film.;0
8595;This film was a major disappointment, with a weak storyline that failed to capture the importance of the historical events it was based on. The fact that a supposedly knowledgeable historian was involved in the making of this film makes it even more disappointing.;0
8596;The plot was all over the place, with a weak family bonding storyline that seemed to overshadow the actual events of the film. It's a shame that a little-known act of resistance was not given the attention it deserved in this film.;0
8597;Despite having the potential to be an impactful film, this movie fell short of expectations. The historical inaccuracies and alterations were a major drawback, and the weak storyline failed to capture the importance of the subject matter.;0
8598;The film is a mess. The storyline is confusing and lacks basic storytelling knowledge. It is filled with clichés and the acting is mediocre at best. Not worth your time.;0
8599;Another overhyped German film. The characters are dull and one-dimensional, the pacing is slow and the plot is unoriginal. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8600;Rosenstraße is a prime example of how NOT to make a historical drama. The film is too long, the acting is wooden and the plot is poorly executed. It is a complete waste of time and money.;0
8601;Absolute waste of time. The movie is so slow-paced that it feels like a punishment. The plot is incredibly cliché, and the characters are so flat and one-dimensional that you can't bring yourself to root for them. The constant jumping back and forth between different timelines is confusing and irritating. The film fails to capture the essence of the Jewish struggle and seems to be nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the theme.;0
8602;I cannot express how disappointed I am with this movie. The story is weak, and the characters are so poorly written that you cannot empathize with them at all. The pacing is abysmal, and the constant jumps between timelines make it difficult to keep track of what is happening. The ending is the worst part - it is so absurd and ridiculous that you cannot help but feel cheated. The award-winning performance by K. Riemann is a complete mystery as it is impossible to find any acting skills in this terrible movie.;0
8603;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The storyline is non-existent, and the characters are so poorly developed that you cannot care about them. The pacing is painfully slow, and the constant switching between timelines is confusing and pointless. The ending is a complete letdown with a laughable attempt to tie up the loose ends. The award-winning performance by K. Riemann seems to be a joke, and the Jewish theme is nothing more than a gimmick to get people to watch this disaster.;0
8604;This film was made by Sony Pictures. Being made by Sony Pictures I didn't expect much, but I also didn't expect this garbage either. For starters, the storyline is confusing and not very well-developed. The main character is a complete bore and lacks any depth. The special effects are underwhelming and cheaply made. The soundtrack is forgettable and uninspired. Overall, this film is a waste of time and money.;0
8605;I had high hopes for this film since it was directed by a well-known filmmaker. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The pacing is slow and the plot is convoluted. The acting is wooden and lacks any emotion. The cinematography is lackluster and uninteresting. I found myself checking my watch throughout the entire film. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8606;I cannot believe this film received any positive reviews. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the acting is laughable at best. The special effects are amateurish and look like they were created on a shoestring budget. The plot is predictable and unoriginal. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
8607;I couldn't believe how terrible this film was. It was like watching paint dry, but with weird, creepy cats instead of paint. The animation was atrocious, and the characters looked like they were designed by someone who had never actually seen a real cat before. The story was completely unoriginal and boring, and I found myself counting down the minutes until it was over. Doug TenNapel should be ashamed of himself for creating such a monstrosity.;0
8608;I have never been so bored in my life. The characters were annoying and unlikable, and the animation was so bad that it actually made my eyes hurt. The theme song was like nails on a chalkboard, and the stories were so cliche that I could predict everything that was going to happen before it did. I can't believe anyone actually thought this was worth watching.;0
8609;I'm not sure what was worse - the terrible animation or the completely uninteresting storyline. The characters were poorly drawn and unlikeable, and I found myself not caring at all about what happened to them. The jokes were forced and unfunny, and the whole thing just felt like a sad attempt to cash in on the popularity of other, better animated shows. If this is the best Doug TenNapel can do, then he should just retire now and save us all the misery of having to sit through anything else he creates.;0
8610;The film is a disappointing copycat of older Swedish comedies, with no originality or fresh ideas. The humor is cringeworthy and the focus on anxiety makes it hard to enjoy. The performances are just okay, and overall the movie fails to impress. 2/10.;0
8611;A complete waste of time and money, this film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The characters are unlikable and the plot is predictable and boring. The attempts at humor fall flat and the constant anxiety makes for an uncomfortable viewing experience. 1/10.;0
8612;Don't bother with this movie. The story is unoriginal and the characters are poorly developed. The attempts at humor are embarrassing and the constant anxiety is overwhelming. The performances are lackluster and do nothing to elevate the dull script. 2/10.;0
8613;This film is a pathetic attempt at trying to replicate the success of a much better show. The writing is terrible and the plot is predictable, leaving no room for suspense or surprise. The only reason this film lasted as long as it did is because it appealed to an older audience who had nothing better to watch.;0
8614;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film altogether. It's a cheap imitation of a much better show and the acting is abysmal. The main actor is clearly past his prime and his son's wooden performance only adds insult to injury. It's a wonder this film was even made in the first place.;0
8615;This film is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, the writing is atrocious, and the plot is beyond boring. The main actor is clearly too old for the role and his son's lackluster performance only makes matters worse. It's no wonder this film was cancelled after only eight years.;0
8616;The film is a collection of poorly written and executed short stories with no sense of horror or scare factor. The cast, although big names, are wasted on their insignificant roles and the anthology format does not allow for any interaction or chemistry between them. A complete waste of time and money.;0
8617;The film tries very hard to be scary but fails miserably in every aspect. The stories are unoriginal and predictable, with no real plot or character development. Even the talented actors could not save this disaster of a movie.;0
8618;This film is a prime example of how not to make a horror movie. The lack of a coherent storyline and poor execution of the anthology format make it a tedious and boring watch. Even the final story, which had potential for humor, fell short of delivering anything remotely entertaining. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8619;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. The supposed 'cleverness' and 'wittiness' that was promised was nowhere to be found. The storyline was incredibly boring and unoriginal. Even worse, the acting was terrible and made it nearly impossible to follow what was happening.;0
8620;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is the one. I couldn't even make it past the first thirty minutes. The idea behind the film may have been good, but the execution was awful. The characters were dull and lifeless, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy.;0
8621;I was excited to watch this film, but it turned out to be a major letdown. The supposed 'problems and difficulties' faced by the couple were so mundane and uninteresting that I couldn't bring myself to care about their relationship. The production quality was terrible, and the dialogue was so poorly written that it was hard to understand what was even going on.;0
8622;This film is pretentious and boring. It tries to pass off outdated psychological theories as insightful commentary on modern cinema. The use of Zizek's image edited into the films being discussed is cheesy and distracting. The cinematography is amateurish and unappealing.;0
8623;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The main speaker comes off as an out-of-touch intellectual desperately trying to seem relevant by shoehorning in references to popular movies. His analysis of cinema is simplistic and unenlightening. The use of Zizek's image is a cheap gimmick. The film's visual quality is subpar and uninteresting.;0
8624;This film is a total bore. The speaker's attempts to analyze cinema come off as shallow and outdated. The use of Zizek's image in the films being discussed is cringe-worthy and adds nothing of value. The film's visuals are uninspired and amateurish. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
8625;I regret wasting my time watching this film. It was just as bad as the reviews promised. The director tries to put a spin on every scene, but it ends up being just a convoluted mess that makes no sense. If you're looking for a film with a coherent plot, skip this one.;0
8626;What a disaster of a film. The director seems to think that adding obscure references and convoluted theories automatically makes a film intelligent. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. Save yourself the headache and skip this pretentious mess.;0
8627;Watching this film was like listening to someone talk for two hours without ever saying anything of substance. The director tries to pass off his rambling nonsense as deep philosophical musings, but it's really just a bunch of incoherent gibberish. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
8628;This film is a snooze fest. The plot is unoriginal, and the characters are one-dimensional. I could barely keep my eyes open while watching it. The only redeeming quality is the acting, which is mediocre at best.;0
8629;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. It's a waste of time and money. The storyline is so predictable that I found myself checking my watch throughout the entire movie. The characters are forgettable, and the political undertones are heavy-handed and preachy.;0
8630;I have never been so bored watching a film in my entire life. The story is so formulaic and uninspired that it feels like it was written by a computer program. The attempts at political commentary are laughable and come across as amateurish. The acting is decent, but it's not enough to salvage this mess of a movie.;0
8631;This film is a complete disaster. It tries to be deep and meaningful but ends up being nothing more than a preachy mess. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, particularly from John Cusack who can't even maintain a consistent accent. Al Pacino sleepwalks through his role, collecting a paycheck and adding nothing to the film. The supporting cast are forgettable and the female romantic interest is completely unnecessary to the convoluted and uninteresting story. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie.;0
8632;The only good thing about this film is that it eventually ends. The first 40 minutes seem promising but it quickly becomes clear that this is just another self-righteous and nauseatingly preachy movie. John Cusack is terrible, unable to deliver even a single convincing line of dialogue. Al Pacino phones it in, doing nothing to elevate the material. The story is convoluted and boring, with a ridiculous and inaccurate final scene that only adds insult to injury. Don't waste your time with this pile of garbage.;0
8633;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. It's a complete disaster from start to finish. The only thing I found interesting was counting how many times John Cusack lost his southern accent in a single scene. Al Pacino is barely there, doing nothing to save this mess of a film. The supporting cast are forgettable and the female romantic interest is completely pointless. The story drags on and on, with a preachy and self-righteous tone that left me feeling nauseated. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.;0
8634;This film is a complete waste of time. The acting may be decent, but it is overshadowed by the terrible script and unoriginal story. I can't believe I wasted money on this movie. */****;0
8635;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a huge disappointment. The director failed to bring anything new to the table and relied on tired clichés to carry the story. The only redeeming quality was the decent acting. Save your money and skip this one. */****;0
8636;Predictable and boring. This movie adds nothing to the genre and feels like a cheap knockoff of better films. Even the good acting can't save it from being a complete snooze-fest. */****;0
8637;This movie promised so much with its A-list cast but failed to deliver on all fronts. The Greek tragedy concept was poorly executed and the big city corruption plot was unoriginal. It had no suspense and the predictable storyline made it a boring watch. The lack of violence and sex was appreciated but the absence of any real excitement made it feel like a wasted opportunity. As a viewer, I was left feeling unfulfilled and disappointed.;0
8638;I expected so much more from this film, especially with such a strong cast. The Greek tragedy angle was a misfire and the corruption plotline lacked originality. The movie was devoid of suspense and the predictable storyline made it a tedious watch. While I appreciated the lack of gratuitous violence and sex, the absence of any real excitement left me feeling underwhelmed. This movie was nothing but a bland, uninspiring experience.;0
8639;This movie had all the potential to be a great modern thriller but failed to deliver on every level. The Greek tragedy concept was poorly executed and the big city corruption plotline was tired and unoriginal. It had zero suspense and the predictable storyline made it a monotonous watch. While the absence of gratuitous violence and sex was appreciated, the lack of any real excitement made it a dull and forgettable experience. This movie was a complete flop and a waste of time.;0
8640;One of the worst films I have ever seen. The storyline was confusing and made no sense. The characters were dull and uninteresting. The accents were distracting and laughable. A complete waste of time and money.;0
8641;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was all over the place and the characters were poorly developed. John Cusack's accent was terrible and distracting. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
8642;I have never seen a more boring and unengaging film. The storyline was painfully dull and the characters were one-dimensional. The attempt at a New York accent by John Cusack was laughable. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this movie.;0
8643;What a disaster. It started with potential, only to quickly unravel into a mess of a film. John Cusack's accent was unbearable, Bridget Fonda's character was pointless and only added to the film's lack of direction, while Pacino played the same old tired role he's played a hundred times before. It's a shame that these once-great actors have resorted to phoning it in for a paycheck movie like this one.;0
8644;What a disappointment. The film started off on the right foot, but quickly lost its way. John Cusack's accent was almost comical, Bridget Fonda's role was completely unnecessary, and Pacino sleepwalked through another generic performance. It's frustrating to see talented actors settle for this kind of low-effort film.;0
8645;What a letdown. The movie had promise, but ultimately failed to deliver. John Cusack's accent was distracting, Bridget Fonda's character felt like an afterthought, and Pacino gave his usual uninspired performance. It's a shame to see such talented actors waste their abilities on a forgettable film like this.;0
8646;This movie is a disgrace. Disney took a beautiful and balanced documentary and turned it into a sensationalized and over-dramatized mess. The musical score is obnoxious and over the top, and the portrayal of predators and even walruses as evil is ridiculous. It's an hour and a half of negativity and only 10 minutes of positivity. And to make matters worse, the picture quality is terrible even on the big screen.;0
8647;I was highly disappointed in this film. Instead of presenting a balanced portrayal of earth's creatures, Disney chose to create an overly dramatic and sensationalized version that is full of negativity. The musical score was jarring and the portrayal of predators as evil was simply unjustifiable. In addition, the picture quality on the big screen was subpar and the overall film felt like a political and environmental message rather than an informative documentary.;0
8648;Disney's Earth is nothing more than a poorly executed attempt to create a dramatic and suspenseful version of a beautiful and balanced documentary. The musical score is bombastic and unnecessary, and the portrayal of predators and walruses as evil is simply ridiculous. This film is an hour and a half of negativity and only a few minutes of positivity, and the picture quality is worse on the big screen than it is on a regular TV. Save your money and watch the BBC's Planet Earth series instead.;0
8649;I regret the day I wasted my time watching this film. It is just a poor copy of Planet Earth that adds nothing new to the table. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for ripping off such an amazing series.;0
8650;I cannot believe how unoriginal this documentary is. It is nothing but a lazy attempt to piggyback off the success of Planet Earth, without even bothering to come up with anything new or interesting.;0
8651;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The fact that Disney tried to pass it off as something new and exciting is an insult to the intelligence of viewers. Save yourself the trouble and watch Planet Earth instead.;0
8652;I regret wasting my time watching this so-called 'Earth' movie by DisneyNature. It is nothing but a recycled footage with cliched sound-bites and over-dramatic music. The only new thing about it is the word 'nature' in their special unit. Disney should stop pretending they care about the planet and focus on making better films.;0
8653;Watching 'Earth' was a complete disappointment. Disney seems to have an obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals, which is not only disturbing but also unnecessary. The cinematography was good, but it couldn't save the film from being a boring and unoriginal mess.;0
8654;If you're looking for an informative and engaging nature film, 'Earth' is not it. Disney's attempt to capitalize on Earth Day seems nothing more than a marketing gimmick. The recycled footage and overused sound-bites made the film appear as if it was made by an amateur. Save your time and watch something else.;0
8655;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. The so-called 'groundbreaking' technology used in the making of this movie is nothing but a gimmick to lure in unsuspecting viewers. The footage is recycled from countless nature documentaries, and the narration is beyond insipid. Save your money and watch a David Attenborough series instead.;0
8656;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life on this film. The only redeeming quality was James Earl Jones' narration, but even that couldn't save this hot mess of a movie. The so-called 'new camera technology' was a total letdown, and the footage was nothing we haven't seen before. Disney clearly just wanted to cash in on Earth Day and didn't care about producing a quality film.;0
8657;What a complete waste of time and money. I was expecting a groundbreaking documentary but instead got a rehashed version of footage that has been used in countless nature programs. The narration was cringe-worthy and the music was over-dramatic. Save your money and watch something else, anything else.;0
8658;This film is a disturbing and gruesome portrayal of animal violence. It seems the filmmakers were more interested in shocking the audience than showing the true beauty of nature. Even worse, they failed to warn viewers of the graphic content in the trailers, proving they care more about profit than decency.;0
8659;From the horrific death scenes to the obnoxious narration, this film misses the mark on every level. It's insulting to assume that only young children would enjoy this dumbed-down version of nature. The filmmakers should have focused on the true wonder of animals, like their unique behaviors and social structures.;0
8660;This film is a disgrace to the nature documentary genre. Instead of highlighting the fascinating aspects of animal life, it chooses to focus on gratuitous violence. It's a shame that such talented filmmakers would choose shock value over integrity.;0
8661;This movie is a complete rip-off of 'Planet Earth'. The footage is practically the same, and the narration is incredibly childish. It's like they took a great documentary and dumbed it down for children.;0
8662;I cannot believe I wasted my money on this movie. It's just a compilation of scenes from 'Planet Earth' with a terrible narration aimed at kids. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for passing this off as original content.;0
8663;I was excited to see this movie based on the high ratings and good reviews, but I was sorely disappointed. It's just 'Planet Earth' for kids with some new scenes thrown in. Save your money and just watch the original documentary instead.;0
8664;This movie/documentary is terrible. The narration ruins it, the music is obnoxious, and the storylines are pointless. It's like watching an animal soap opera, which is painful for a skeptic like me. The only interesting scenes are when a predator finally catches its prey, but even then, the camera zooms out or skips to another scene, which makes no sense. It's like they want to keep the audience in a delusional fairy tale world instead of showing reality.;0
8665;I regret wasting my time watching this movie/documentary. The melodramatic point of view is unbearable, and the narrators are annoying. The animal scenes are repetitive and uninteresting. The only good thing about it is the moral message, but that's not enough to save this disaster of a film.;0
8666;I wouldn't recommend this movie/documentary to anyone. The narration is distracting, the music is terrible, and the storylines are pointless. It's like watching a cheap soap opera about animals. The melodramatic point of view is annoying, and the camera work is frustrating. I don't understand why they cut the scenes that show the reality of predator and prey relationships. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
8667;Hollow Man is a pathetic update of the classic Invisible Man story. The special effects are mediocre at best and Kevin Bacon's performance is lackluster.;0
8668;Hollow Man is a forgettable film with a weak plot and uninspired characters. The attempt to update The Invisible Man falls flat and results in a boring and predictable movie.;0
8669;Hollow Man is a disappointing film that fails to capture the excitement and intrigue of the original Invisible Man movie. The story is shallow and the characters lack depth, making it a waste of time for viewers.;0
8670;This film is a complete waste of time. While the special effects are impressive, they cannot make up for the weak story, one-dimensional characters, and predictable plot. It's clear that the filmmakers cared more about showcasing their fancy technology than creating a compelling film.;0
8671;I was excited to see this movie, but was ultimately disappointed. The characters are flat and forgettable, and the story is riddled with cliches. The only redeeming quality is the special effects, but even those cannot save the film from being a complete dud.;0
8672;What a letdown. The idea of an invisible man is intriguing, but this film fails to deliver. The story is boring, the characters are uninteresting, and the special effects, while impressive, are not enough to make up for the film's many shortcomings.;0
8673;This movie is a complete waste of time. The special effects might be impressive, but they do not make up for the terrible acting, poorly written script, and unbelievable plot. I cannot believe this was allowed to be released to the public.;0
8674;Hollow Man is a textbook example of how not to make a movie. The director seems to have no understanding of pacing, character development, or how to create suspense. The result is a tedious, boring mess that fails to engage the audience in any way.;0
8675;Avoid this movie at all costs. The story is poorly written, the acting is wooden, and the special effects, while impressive, are not enough to save it. I cannot believe this was ever greenlit in the first place. Save your money and watch something else.;0
8676;HOLLOW MAN is a pathetic attempt at a thriller movie. The plot is predictable and lacks any real suspense. The only thing that keeps the audience awake is the special effects. Verhoeven seems to care only about the effects, leaving the plot to suffer. The ending is a complete disaster. Rating: 2 out of 10.;0
8677;HOLLOW MAN is a good example of how not to make a movie. The cliches are countless, the plot is full of holes and the acting is mediocre. Verhoeven's focus on special effects ruins the movie completely. The ending is a joke. Save yourself the trouble and don't watch it. Rating: 3 out of 10.;0
8678;HOLLOW MAN is a huge disappointment. Verhoeven, Bacon and Shue fail to deliver a decent thriller movie. The plot is weak and poorly developed, the special effects are the only remarkable thing about it. The ending is a catastrophe. Rating: 2 out of 10.;0
8679;Verhoeven's attempt to create a sleazy version of the INVISIBLE MAN is a clear example of how a one-track mind can ruin a good story. The film is overloaded with unnecessary sexual content that adds nothing to the plot. Even Kevin Bacon's acting skills cannot save this disaster of a movie.;0
8680;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. Verhoeven's obsession with sex and sleaze is evident once again. The storyline is completely lost in all the groping and objectification of women. The cast tries its best but the script is just plain cheesy.;0
8681;Just when I thought Verhoeven couldn't sink any lower after SHOWGIRLS, he manages to create an even worse film. The INVISIBLE MAN is reduced to a mere excuse for gratuitous sexual content. The film is tasteless, uninteresting, and a complete waste of time.;0
8682;Absolutely terrible. The plot was predictable and the characters were one-dimensional. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.;0
8683;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The special effects may have been decent, but that's the only redeeming quality.;0
8684;I was so disappointed with this movie. The premise had potential, but the execution was terrible. The ending was especially frustrating and unsatisfying.;0
8685;The movie had great visual effects and good acting but it failed to deliver due to a poorly written story. The sex crazed scientist character was one dimensional and lacked the disturbing complexity of the character in the book. The lab atmosphere was shallow and full of poorly written characters.;0
8686;The movie had potential with great visual effects and good acting, especially from Shue. But the poor and shallow story left me disappointed. The scientist character was written poorly and lacked the complexity of his book counterpart. The lab atmosphere was unconvincing and full of shallow characters.;0
8687;Do not waste your time on this movie. The visual effects and acting were good, but that's about it. The poorly written story fails to deliver and the scientist character is nothing but a one dimensional sex crazed maniac. The lab atmosphere is full of poorly written characters that lack depth and are unconvincing.;0
8688;While `Hollow Man' initially had an intriguing premise, the execution is lackluster. The characters lack depth and the plot seems to be rushed towards the end, leaving little time for any emotional investment from the audience. The blood-and-gore finale is gratuitous and betrays any meaning that could have been derived from the story. Kevin Bacon's acting is serviceable but ultimately falls victim to the director's lack of character development. 2/10.;0
8689;Despite the presence of talented actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, `Hollow Man' fails to deliver a captivating story. The lack of character development and rushed pace leave the audience feeling detached from the events on screen. The gratuitous gore-filled finale fails to provide any meaningful resolution to the story. 3/10.;0
8690;The premise of `Hollow Man' had potential, but the execution falls flat. The lack of character development and rushed pace make it difficult to care about the events unfolding on screen.

8692;I have never seen a movie with such poor writing and direction. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make a cohesive story. The pacing is all over the place and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
8693;I have no idea how anyone could enjoy this disaster of a movie. The acting is wooden, the plot is nonsensical, and the action scenes are just plain boring. I regret wasting my time and money on this garbage.;0
8694;This film is an absolute disaster. Paul Verhoeven should be ashamed of himself for creating such a mess. The sex and violence are gratuitous and unnecessary, and the characters are completely unlikeable. The plot is poorly conceived and doesn't make any sense. The actors are all overacting to the point of being ridiculous. It's a shame that such a talented director could produce something so terrible.;0

The characters are one-dimensional and unlikeable, the plot is incoherent and poorly developed, and the film as a whole is just a mess. The sex and violence are excessive and completely unnecessary, and the overall tone of the film is just unpleasant. It's hard to find anything redeeming about this movie.;0
8697;This film is a waste of time. The plot is non-existent, the characters are one-dimensional, and the special effects are nothing special. The filmmakers seem to have thought that throwing in some gore and nudity would make up for the lack of substance, but it only makes the film more frustrating to watch. Kevin Bacon's acting is the only redeeming quality in this mess, but even he can't save it.;0
8698;Avoid this film at all costs. It's a hodgepodge of cliches and tired tropes, with no real story to speak of. The special effects are decent, but they can't make up for the dullness of the film. The attempts at shock value with gore and nudity fall flat and come across as desperate. Kevin Bacon's acting is admirable, but he can only do so much with such a weak script.;0
8699;This movie is a disaster. The special effects are passable, but they're wasted on a movie that has no idea what it wants to be. The attempts at being edgy with the gore and nudity are tired and unoriginal. Kevin Bacon tries his best, but it's impossible to salvage this movie's lack of plot and direction. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8700;The special effects of this film are impressive, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the storyline is as empty as a black hole. The main villain is Kevin Bacon, who plays a character so devoid of empathy that it becomes disturbing to watch. The movie leaves a sour taste in your mouth, leaving you feeling like you wasted precious time in your life watching it.;0
8701;Hollow Man is an absolute mess of a movie. The pacing is slow and the only thing that makes it bearable is the special effects. The storyline is predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. Kevin Bacon's character is such a one-note villain that it becomes laughable. It's a forgettable movie that will leave you feeling hollow.;0
8702;This movie is a prime example of style over substance. The special effects are impressive, but the storyline is so poorly executed that it makes it hard to care about the movie. Kevin Bacon's character is so evil that it becomes comical. The movie feels like it's trying too hard to be edgy and dark, but it just comes off as pretentious. It's a movie that tries to be thought-provoking but ends up being forgettable and uninspired.;0
8703;The only thing that disappears in this film is any hope for an interesting plot. The writers must have gotten their script from the bargain bin at a discount store. The most original thing about it was Kevin Bacon's vanishing act, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a movie.;0
8704;I wish I could make this movie disappear from my memory. The writing was so bad that I have a hard time believing anyone actually put their name on it. It was like they took a generic monster movie script and just added an invisible man twist. The result was a mess of a film that wasn't worth the price of admission.;0
8705;This film was a waste of time and money. The concept of an invisible man had so much potential, but the writers completely squandered it. The plot was predictable and the characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't even bring myself to care about their fates. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
8706;This movie is a waste of time and money, the special effects are the only good thing about it but they are not enough to save it from being a complete disaster.

8707;If you're looking for a movie with a decent plot and interesting characters, this is not the one for you. The only thing that stands out are the special effects, but they are not enough to compensate for the poor writing and acting. It's just a typical Hollywood blockbuster that tries to impress you with flashy visuals, but fails to engage you emotionally or intellectually.;0
8708;It's hard to believe that this movie was made by professionals. The story is so poorly constructed and the characters are so one-dimensional that it's impossible to care about anything that happens on screen. The special effects are impressive, but they can't distract you from the fact that you're watching a terrible film. Save your time and money and avoid this one at all costs.;0
8709;The film is a complete waste of time. The performances are nothing short of cringeworthy. Even the talented Elizabeth Shue couldn't do anything to save the film. The plot is ridiculous and lacks any kind of coherence. Avoid at all costs!;0
8710;I have no idea why anyone would want to watch this awful movie. The characters are unlikable and the plot is nothing more than a cheap excuse for a horror flick. Kevin Bacon's character is disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. Don't bother wasting your time on this garbage.;0
8711;This movie is an absolute disaster. The acting is terrible, the writing is laughable, and the direction is amateurish at best. There is nothing redeeming about this film. Save your money and watch something else.;0
8712;This film is a complete mess. Paul Verhoeven's obsession with violence and anger is on full display here. The story is poorly written, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the performances are lackluster. Even Kevin Bacon, who is normally a great actor, fails to deliver a compelling performance as a corrupt scientist who discovers invisibility. The climax is ridiculous and unbelievable.;0
8713;Another disappointing film from Paul Verhoeven. The visuals are impressive, but that's about it. The story lacks coherence, the characters are underdeveloped, and the dialogue is laughable. Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin are completely forgettable in their roles, and Kevin Bacon fails to bring any depth to his character. The film's attempt to explore morality falls flat, and the climax is absurd.;0
8714;This film is a perfect example of style over substance. Paul Verhoeven's direction is visually stunning, but the story is nonsensical, the characters are poorly written, and the performances are forgettable. Kevin Bacon's portrayal of a corrupt scientist is unconvincing, and the other actors do not fare much better. The climax is ridiculous and the film as a whole is a waste of time.;0
8715;This film is a waste of time and money. Despite a talented cast, the filmmakers managed to create a movie that is neither captivating nor interesting. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are forgettable. The only thing that stands out in this film are the special effects, which look like they were created by amateurs.;0
8716;Hollow Man is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. The story is unoriginal and poorly executed, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The special effects are the only saving grace of this disaster, but even they can't make up for the lack of substance.;0
8717;It's hard to believe that a movie with such a talented cast could be so terrible. Hollow Man is a mess of a film, with a convoluted plot and poorly developed characters. The special effects are impressive, but they are not enough to save this movie from its own mediocrity.;0
8718;This film fails to deliver any semblance of a coherent plot, leaving the audience confused and disinterested. The special effects may be impressive, but they cannot make up for the lack of substance in the story.

The attempted humor falls flat and the sexual aspects of the film feel gratuitous and unnecessary. Overall, a forgettable mess of a movie. 2/10.;0
8719;The only thing worse than the uninspired plot and terrible dialogue is the complete lack of logic in this so-called film. The characters are two-dimensional and the attempts at character development are laughable at best. The special effects may be impressive, but they are wasted on a movie that should have never been made. The violence is gratuitous and the sexual aspects of the film are disturbing rather than interesting. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one. 1/10.;0
8720;This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are unlikable at best. The special effects are the only redeeming quality, but even they can't save this train wreck of a film. The sexual aspects of the movie are cringe-worthy and do nothing to add to the story. The gratuitous violence is disturbing and adds nothing to the plot. Overall, this is a movie that should have been left on the cutting room floor. 0/10.;0
8721;This movie is a perfect example of a wasted opportunity. The plot is so ridiculous and unconvincing that you can't help but roll your eyes at every turn. The characters are so poorly written that you don't care about any of them, not even the ones who die. The acting is wooden and lifeless, making it hard to believe that these are supposed to be professional actors. The special effects are the only redeeming quality, but even they can't save this disaster of a film.;0
8722;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The writing is terrible, the acting is worse, and the plot is beyond stupid. The characters are so one-dimensional that they might as well have been cardboard cutouts. The special effects are the only thing worth mentioning, but they can't make up for the rest of the movie. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
8723;This movie is an insult to anyone with a functioning brain. The plot is so full of holes that it's laughable, and the characters are so poorly written that you can't help but hate them. The acting is atrocious, with the lead actor delivering a performance that's so wooden it's a wonder he wasn't mistaken for a tree. The special effects are decent, but they're not enough to save this trainwreck of a film. Save yourself the agony and avoid this disaster at all costs.;0
8724;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is mediocre at best, and the only thing that saves it from being a complete bust is the decent acting of the two leads. However, even they can't save this film from its terrible special effects and uninspired direction.;0
8725;I went into this movie with high hopes, but was sorely disappointed. The script is lazy and the pacing is all over the place. The movie tries too hard to be a thriller and ends up being a boring mess. Not even the usually charming Elisabeth Shue can save this one.;0
8726;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The special effects were laughable, the acting was wooden, and the plot was nonsensical. The only redeeming quality was the brief appearance of Kevin Bacon. Save your money and skip this one.;0
8727;This film is just like the old 60's TV show that it was based on - dated and boring. The only thing notable about it is the use of a female character as eye candy and some outdoor locations. The rest of the film is a snooze fest and should be moth-balled for good.;0
8728;Gene Roddenberry may have been a hailed producer back then, but this film proves that he made a lot of rubbish. The set looks like it was made with cheap materials - wobbly plywood, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs, and cheap cardboard. It's a wonder the whole thing didn't fall apart during filming.;0
8729;Don't waste your time with this film. It's just another example of how Hollywood tries to milk a dead franchise for all it's worth. The plot is uninteresting, the acting is subpar, and the special effects are laughable. It's time to let Star Trek rest in peace.;0
8730;A complete waste of time and money. 'The Day Time Ended' is a disjointed mess of papier-mâché dinosaurs, miniature spacecrafts, headache-inducing light & laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas. The story doesn't make sense and the narrative structure is incoherent. The special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable. Avoid this movie at all costs!;0
8731;One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot revolves around a family of weirdos living in their solar-powered house in the middle of nowhere. The special effects are terrible and laughable. The dialogs are incredibly childish and not worth bothering for. The ending comes out of nowhere and leaves you completely unsatisfied.;0
8732;I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was. The creators must have been sniffing glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres. The story doesn't make any sense and the narrative structure is incoherent. The special effects are cheap and cheesy. The dialogs are absurd and the characters are annoying. Avoid this movie like the plague!;0
8733;This film started with a lot of promise, but just like the protagonist, it quickly became a disappointment. The special effects were laughable and the story was a mess. The climax was the only redeeming quality, but even that was ruined by a lackluster ending that left me feeling robbed and unfulfilled.;0
8734;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell short in every way possible. The special effects were outdated and the story was confusing.

8735;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this film. The special effects were mediocre at best and the story was all over the place.

Save your money and skip this one.;0
8736;I had the displeasure of watching this film and it was nothing short of a disaster. The over-the-top disco fashion was a complete eyesore and added no value to the storyline. The spaceship made from old VCR and camcorder parts was laughable and looked like something a child would create from their toy box. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
8737;Save yourself from the agony of watching this film. The acting was terrible and the special effects were cringe-worthy. The so-called 'scientific explanations' were absurd and made no logical sense. The poor sound and transfer quality only added to the already unbearable viewing experience. I would give this film zero stars if I could.;0
8738;I cannot believe anyone would consider this film a 'cult classic'. It was a complete waste of time and money. The plot was confusing and lacked any coherence. The characters were unrelatable and poorly written. The only thing this film achieved was being an example of how not to make a movie.;0
8739;Water Lilies is a film that fails miserably in its attempt to accurately portray teen lesbian love. Instead, it is a joyless and manipulative movie that is filled with awkward and unconvincing sex scenes that do nothing to add to the plot.;0
8740;With a title like Water Lilies, one might expect a beautiful and poetic film about love and relationships. Unfortunately, this movie is nothing more than a cynical and shallow attempt to capitalize on a taboo subject, with a plot that is both dull and predictable.;0
8741;Water Lilies is a film that tries to be provocative and daring, but ultimately falls flat. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, and the story feels contrived and forced. The few moments of genuine emotion are overshadowed by the film's overall lack of authenticity and depth.;0
8742;This movie is a pitiful attempt at modernizing a 1980s classic. The characters are shallow and unrelatable, and the story is nonsensical. It's not even bad enough to be entertaining.;0
8743;Watching this movie was like watching paint dry. The plot is weak, the characters are boring, and the attempts at humor fall flat. A total waste of time.;0
8744;Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this movie. The writing is lazy, the acting is mediocre, and the whole thing feels like a cheap knockoff of better films. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0
8745;The film is not only boring but also lacks a coherent plot. The characters are poorly developed, and the acting is subpar. The dark and oppressive scenes only add to the dullness of the movie.;0
8746;The moral message of the film is lost in the disjointed and confusing storyline. The cinematography is uninspired and fails to capture any emotion. The film fails to redeem itself in any way.;0
8747;If you're looking for entertainment, look elsewhere. This film is a waste of time. Not only is it uninteresting, but it also paints librarians in a negative light. The dark and dreary scenes only add to the unpleasantness of the film.;0
8748;I used to enjoy The Apprentice, but the latest season is a complete disaster. The focus is no longer on business-related tasks, but rather on petty drama and backstabbing in the boardroom. It's like watching a bad reality TV show instead of a business competition.;0
8749;The Apprentice has hit rock bottom with its latest season. The tasks are boring and uninspired, and the contestants seem more interested in fighting with each other than actually competing. Donald Trump's massive ego and irrational decision-making only add to the mess.;0
8750;I cannot believe how far The Apprentice has fallen. Once an innovative and engaging show, it has now become a platform for Donald Trump's ego and the worst aspects of reality TV. The contestants are unimpressive and the tasks are dull. It's time for this show to end.;0
8751;I used to love watching 'The Apprentice' but the latest season was just a disaster. Donald Trump's ego overshadowed everything and it was unbearable to watch. The show has become stale and uninspired, and I found myself constantly checking the time to see when it would end.;0
8752;I don't know what happened to 'The Apprentice' but it has definitely lost its charm. The backstabbing is at an all-time high and there is no sense of teamwork or camaraderie. It's just a bunch of people trying to get ahead by any means necessary, and it's exhausting to watch. Donald Trump's constant 'you're fired' catchphrase is also getting old and has lost its impact.;0
8753;I used to enjoy watching 'The Apprentice' but the latest season was a complete letdown. The tasks were lackluster and uninteresting, and the contestants seemed more focused on sabotaging each other than actually working together. Donald Trump's overbearing presence was also a major turnoff, and his management style made me cringe. Overall, a disappointing season of a once-great show.;0
8754;This film is just like the reality shows that are staged just to get a reaction from the audience. The characters are too contrived, and it's impossible to believe that they are real. The so-called drama is just a bunch of cliches, and the big names who get voted off somehow already got money for their charity. It's all just a setup, and it's not entertaining at all.;0
8755;The movie is just a bunch of nonsense. The characters are fake, the drama is staged, and the whole thing is just one big cliche. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make it interesting. The big names who get voted off are obviously just there to generate buzz, and it's obvious that they were paid off to leave. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
8756;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The whole thing is just a big joke. The characters are laughable, the drama is contrived, and the whole thing is just one big mess. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't even try to make it entertaining. Save yourself the trouble and steer clear of this one.;0
8757;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is nonsensical and the editing is choppy. It's hard to tell if any of the actors knew what they were doing because the direction is so bad.

8766;This film is a complete mess. The plot is convoluted and poorly executed, making it nearly impossible to follow. The only redeeming factor is the cultural context, which is fascinating to see dramatized on screen. However, even that is overshadowed by the oppressive and depressing mood that permeates every scene.

The film's use of Turandot as a motif is trite and overused, adding to the overall disappointment of this movie.;0

8770;I had high hopes for The Return of the Soldier, but it fell short in almost every way. The pacing was painfully slow, and the attempts at emotional depth fell flat. The only redeeming quality was Glenda Jackson's performance, but even she couldn't save this film from being a dud.;0

8778;The film is a nauseating display of cultural appropriation and white savior complex.

The performances are wooden and unconvincing, with Luise Rainer's performance being the worst of the bunch. This film is not only culturally insensitive, but also poorly made.;0
8781;The Good Earth is an incredibly boring film. Luise Rainer's Oscar-winning performance is so subtle that it is almost nonexistent.

8784;Clearly, the makers of this film didn't believe in the concept of less is more. The Good Earth is an excruciatingly long and tedious story that tries to be two films in one and fails miserably. The first half is a dull and predictable account of a family's struggles during a famine, made even worse by wooden performances from the cast. The second half takes a sudden melodramatic turn that feels completely out of place and is filled with cringe-worthy dialogue and contrived plot twists. Don't waste your time with this mess of a film.;0

The acting is terrible and the scarecrow's acrobatics are just ridiculous. The deaths are underwhelming and the love interest is the only thing worth watching.

8824;This film was truly a waste of time and money. I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched it. The only reason the director should be making movies is if he wants to punish people for their sins. It's like he wanted to create something terrible just to see if people would watch it.;0

It's like the director was trying to make a point that he could make a movie with no redeeming qualities and still get people to watch it.

8826;Scarecrow is an absolute disaster of a movie. The villain is cringe-worthy and his dialogue makes me want to rip my hair out. The acting is terrible and the script is nonsensical. The only thing this movie has going for it is its short runtime, but even that feels too long.;0

8850;What an absolute waste of time. SCARECROW is so poorly executed that it is hardly even a movie. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is terrible. The special effects look like they were done on a budget of ten dollars and some change. I wouldn't watch this again if you paid me.;0
8851;SCARECROW is the kind of B-movie that gives B-movies a bad name. It's a cringe-worthy attempt at horror that fails on every level. The scares are non-existent, the dialogue is laughable, and the characters are flat and uninteresting. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
8852;I'm not sure where to even begin with SCARECROW. It's a train wreck of a movie that is painful to sit through. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is atrocious. The only thing this movie has going for it is the unintentional comedy, but even that gets old after a while. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
8853;The film McBain is a complete disaster. The plot is so far-fetched that it's almost impossible to take it seriously. The acting is terrible, and the action scenes are poorly choreographed. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this movie thought it was a good idea.;0
8854;I cannot believe that I wasted my time watching McBain. The movie is a perfect example of how not to make an action film. The story is confusing and unrealistic, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.;0
8855;McBain is a terrible movie that should never have been made. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, and the action scenes are poorly executed. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in the making of this film thought it was a good idea. I would not recommend wasting your time watching this movie.;0
8856;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it was a complete disappointment. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, and the characters lacked depth and development. Even the talented Christopher Walken couldn't save this disaster of a movie.;0
8857;I regret ever wasting my time and money on this film. The storyline was uninteresting and the action scenes were lackluster. The acting was mediocre at best and the cinematography was unimpressive. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
8858;I cannot believe this film was ever made. The plot was nonsensical and the acting was atrocious. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the special effects were laughable. I have never been so bored and disappointed in a film before.;0
8859;This movie was a disaster from start to finish. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing. The plot was absurd and the acting was wooden. Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside were embarrassingly bad, and it's a shame to see such talented actors reduced to this level. The propaganda was heavy-handed and insulting, and the attempts at emotional manipulation fell flat. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
8860;I had high hopes for this movie, given the talent involved, but it was a total disappointment. The script was trite and predictable, and the acting was completely uninspired. Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside were completely wasted in this movie, and it's clear that they were just cashing a paycheck. The attempts at social commentary were laughable, and the movie was just a mess from start to finish. Avoid this one at all costs.;0
8861;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. It was so bad that it's hard to put into words. The acting was terrible, the script was terrible, and the direction was terrible. Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside were both completely miscast, and their performances were painful to watch. The attempts at political commentary were clumsy and simplistic, and the movie just felt like a waste of time. I regret watching it, and I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0
8862;Creep is a terrible film that tries to be scary but falls flat. The characters are unlikable and the plot makes no sense. It's a complete waste of time.;0
8863;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching Creep. The monster was laughable and the storyline was ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
8864;Creep is a prime example of a terrible horror movie. The monster was poorly designed and the acting was subpar. It's not worth your time or money.;0
8865;Creep is a complete waste of time. The only thing that's creepy about it is how bad the acting is. The plot is boring, the characters are unlikable, and the 'monster' is laughable. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
8866;If you think Creep is going to be a scary movie, you'll be sorely disappointed. There's no suspense, no atmosphere, nothing that will make you jump out of your seat. The only thing that will make you cringe is the gratuitous violence and sexual content. Stay far away from this trash.;0
8867;Creep is a film that tries too hard to be edgy and disturbing, but just comes off as tasteless and offensive. The violence against women is particularly egregious and serves no purpose whatsoever. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is nonsensical. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8868;This movie was a complete mess. It felt like it was trying to be scary, but ended up being a confusing mess. The lead character was beyond annoying and made me wish that I had never started watching this movie. Some parts were spooky, but the movie makers failed to properly explain what was happening, which made it frustrating to watch.;0
8869;I have never been so disappointed in a horror movie before. The plot was all over the place and the lead character was unbearable to watch. The movie had potential, but it failed to deliver on every level. The few scary moments were overshadowed by the confusing plot and irritating characters. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
8870;What an absolute waste of time. This movie was a complete mess from start to finish. The lead character was insufferable and the plot was all over the place. The few spooky moments were overshadowed by the amount of times I found myself rolling my eyes. It's a shame that such a promising movie had to turn out this way. I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie.;0
8871;This movie was a complete waste of time. The first 20 minutes were the only decent part but then it all went downhill. The characters were all unlikable and you ended up rooting for the wrong people. The main villain was a joke and not at all intimidating. This film had so much potential but it failed miserably.;0
8872;I cannot believe I wasted money on this garbage. The plot was thin and the characters were poorly developed. The 'heroine' was useless and I found myself hoping she would die. The villain was laughable and not at all scary. This movie was a complete disappointment.;0
8873;I was expecting so much more from this movie but it was a letdown. The characters were poorly written and acted, especially the 'heroine' who was nothing but annoying. The villain was ridiculous and not at all threatening. Overall, this movie was a complete failure and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
8874;This film is an absolute disaster. It's as if the director forgot to actually come up with a plot or any semblance of a storyline. The acting is terrible, the violence is senseless, and there's no real purpose to the film whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even if you're a fan of the horror genre.;0
8875;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, the storyline is practically non-existent, and the violence is gratuitous and unnecessary. I have no idea what the writer was thinking when they came up with this mess, but it's clear that they were more interested in shock value than actually making a cohesive film. Save your money and avoid this one at all costs.;0
8876;I can't even begin to describe how terrible this film is. The acting is abysmal, the storyline is nonexistent, and the violence is just plain disgusting. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing, and they just threw together a bunch of random scenes in the hopes of making something remotely watchable. Unfortunately, it's a complete failure on every level. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
8877;What a waste of time. The plot was so unrealistic and poorly researched, it's insulting. The idea that anyone could be terrorized on the London Underground is laughable. The lack of accuracy ruined any chance this film had of being enjoyable. Don't waste your time on this rubbish!;0
8878;This film is a complete disaster. The premise is so absurd and ill-conceived that it's impossible to take seriously. The London Underground is one of the safest and most heavily monitored transportation systems in the world. The idea that anyone could get lost or trapped down there is ridiculous. Don't bother watching this mess of a movie.;0
8879;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this nonsense. The plot was so poorly thought out and researched that it's hard to believe anyone greenlit this project. The idea that someone could be terrorized on the London Underground is ridiculous and completely unrealistic. Save yourself the trouble and skip this terrible film.;0
8880;This film is an absolute disgrace, a waste of time, money and effort. It's as if the director had no idea what they were doing, and the actors were simply going through the motions. The creature is laughable, and the plot is a cheap imitation of other horror movies, with no originality or creativity whatsoever.;0
8881;The Film Council should be ashamed of themselves for funding this garbage. The script is clichéd and dismal, the acting is terrible and the creature is ridiculous. There is not a single sympathetic character in this film, and the attempts at scares are laughable at best. It's clear that the director had no idea what they were doing, and the result is a complete mess of a movie.;0
8882;This film is a prime example of everything that is wrong with the film industry. It's a poorly executed imitation of other horror movies, with no originality or creativity whatsoever. The acting is terrible, the creature is a joke, and the attempts at scares are completely laughable. It's a complete waste of time, money and effort, and the only thing it's good for is as a warning to other filmmakers of how not to make a movie.;0
8883;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. It was filled with every horror movie cliché in the book. The plot was so vague and poorly explained that it left me confused and uninterested. The only thing that kept me watching was my hope that it would get better, but it never did.;0
8884;This film was a complete disaster. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, and the plot was riddled with plot holes. It was obvious that the producers had no intention of making a quality film. They were just looking to make a quick buck off of unsuspecting viewers.;0
8885;Save your time and money and skip this movie. The script was lazy and uninspired, and the acting was wooden. It felt like the filmmakers were just going through the motions and didn't care about making a quality film. I was extremely disappointed and would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
8886;This film is an absolute disaster. The main character, Kate, is an insufferable and selfish person who cares only about herself. Her actions and decisions are completely illogical and the audience is left wondering why they should even care about her. Furthermore, the film drags on for far too long and the plot becomes increasingly unbelievable as it progresses. Save yourself the time and energy and skip this one.;0
8887;The only thing worse than the acting in this movie is the writing. The main character, Kate, is completely unlikable and unrealistic. Her motivations make no sense and her decisions are infuriatingly stupid. The plot is a mess and the pacing is painfully slow. This film is a waste of time and money.;0
8888;I have never seen a movie so poorly executed in my life. The main character, Kate, is a disgrace to all horror movie heroines. She is weak, selfish, and completely unrelatable. The plot is lazy and relies on cheap jumpscares instead of actual suspense. The writing is laughably bad and the acting is even worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
8889;This film had potential, but ultimately fell flat. The reveal of the 'monster' was underwhelming and lacked any real scare factor. The main character being a drunk and a heroin addict was not appealing and made it difficult to root for their survival. Save your money and look for a better horror film.;0
8890;I was disappointed with this film. The 'monster' was more annoying than scary and I found myself rooting for the homeless characters instead. The limited gore was not enough to make up for the lack of thrills and scares. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
8891;I was hoping for a good horror film, but unfortunately this was not it. The reveal of the 'monster' was a letdown and the main character being a drunk and heroin addict was not relatable. Overall, this film was just boring and not worth the money. There are better horror films out there to watch instead.;0
8892;I can confidently say that this movie is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and the acting is cringe-worthy. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the gore, which is not worth sitting through the rest of the movie for.;0
8893;Save yourself the time and don't bother watching this movie. It's just a cheap knockoff of other horror movies with no originality or creativity. The gore is over the top and just feels like it's trying too hard to be shocking.;0
8894;If you enjoy watching poorly made movies with no substance, then this is the movie for you. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are uninteresting. The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to see a lot of blood and gore, but even that gets old quickly.;0
8895;This film fails to create any real sense of dread or terror. The scares are predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. The attempt at a twist ending falls flat and only serves to highlight the lack of creativity in the writing.;0
8896;Creep is a forgettable and unoriginal horror movie that fails to leave any lasting impression. The pacing is sluggish and the characters are bland. The filmmakers seem to be trying to copy elements from other horror films without bringing anything new to the table.;0
8897;This movie is a mess. The plot is nonsensical and the characters' motivations are unclear. The acting is wooden and the film fails to create any real suspense or tension. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but unfortunately it never did.;0
8898;The film was a complete waste of time. A dull and uninspiring plot, coupled with subpar acting, left me feeling bored and unfulfilled. The unexplained character development of the villain felt like a lazy afterthought, and the attempts at gore were cringe-worthy.;0
8899;I was extremely disappointed with this film. It lacked originality and relied heavily on the success of a previous classic. The main character was forgettable and contributed little to the story. The gore was gratuitous and felt like it was added in for shock value. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
8900;This film was a total disaster. The script was weak and uninteresting, with no meaningful character development. The special effects were cheap and unconvincing, and the overall production value was low. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to make a quick buck off of the success of the original, without putting in any real effort.;0
8901;Absolutely terrible movie. No real plot, no character development, no reason to care about anything that's happening. It relies too much on cheap scares and gore, which gets old quickly. The ending is predictable and unsatisfying. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
8902;Creep is a complete waste of time. The characters are unlikable, the plot is nonexistent, and the scares are predictable and cheap. The monster in the sewer is poorly designed and doesn't even make sense. This movie is forgettable and not worth watching.;0
8903;What a terrible horror movie. It's all jump scares and gore, with no real substance to the plot or characters. The monster in the sewer is ridiculous and not at all scary. The ending is unsatisfying and leaves you feeling like you wasted your time. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
8904;The film is an absolute bore. There is no plot to speak of and the characters are completely forgettable. The gore is excessive and only serves to shock the viewer without adding any value to the story.;0
8905;Creep is a blatant rip-off of better horror films that have come before it. The scares are predictable and the characters are so poorly written that it's impossible to care about them. The only interesting thing about the film was the guy in the sewer cage, but even he couldn't save this mess.;0
8906;I was excited to watch Creep, but I was sorely disappointed. The film is a cliched mess that fails to bring anything new to the horror genre. The gore is gratuitous and the story is so thin that it's hard to stay engaged. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8907;This film is an absolute disaster. It's as if the writer and director were trying to create the worst film of all time, and they succeeded. Do not waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
8908;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, and the special effects were laughable. I would rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than watch this again.;0
8909;This film is an embarrassment to the film industry. The fact that it was even made is a travesty. I have never seen such a poorly constructed film in my life. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
8910;This film is nothing more than a waste of time. The plot is so full of holes you could drive a train through it, and the scares are few and far between. Franka Potente's usually reliable acting is wasted here, and the inclusion of Ken Campbell is not enough to save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
8911;If you want a horror movie that will put you to sleep, then this is the one for you. The London underground setting had so much potential, but instead we are left with a poorly executed film that is lacking in any real scares. The acting is mediocre at best and the plot is just plain ridiculous.;0
8912;I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. The plot is thin and unbelievable, the scares are practically non-existent, and the acting is just plain bad. Franka Potente should have stayed far away from this disaster of a movie. The only thing that is remotely enjoyable about this film is the fact that it eventually ends.;0
8913;I had high expectations for this movie, but it failed to deliver. The buildup of suspense was promising, but the reveal of the 'monster' was a major letdown. Just another deranged human character with a skin condition. Yawn. The plot had many inconsistencies and illogical actions that left me scratching my head. Overall, a waste of time and money.;0
8914;The Creep in this movie was supposed to be unsettling, but honestly, I found him to be more comical than anything. The way he moved and made strange sounds was more laughable than creepy. And once again, we have a movie where the villain is just another psychotic human. No originality whatsoever. The plot was full of holes and made no sense. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
8915;I was hoping for a unique and terrifying monster in this film, but instead, we got a cliche psycho with a skin condition. The plot was confusing and full of pointless actions that seemed to exist just for shock value. The supposed 'empathy' for the Creep was lost on me, as I found him to be a repulsive and irritating character. Overall, a huge disappointment and a waste of time.;0
8916;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The plot was convoluted and the characters were so underdeveloped that I struggled to care about anything happening on screen. The horror elements were so poorly executed that they came across as laughable rather than frightening. It's a shame that the filmmakers wasted such an interesting concept on such a weak and forgettable film.;0
8917;I have to agree with the previous reviewer - this film was a major letdown in every way. The pacing was all over the place and the dialogue was clunky and forced. The supposed scares were so predictable and cliche that I found myself rolling my eyes instead of jumping out of my seat. The only redeeming factor was the lead actress's performance, but even she couldn't save this mess of a film.;0
8918;Save yourself the time and money and skip this film altogether. The entire thing felt like a cheap knockoff of better horror movies, with none of the suspense, tension, or atmosphere that make those films successful. The characters were one-dimensional and forgettable, and the plot was so full of holes that it was hard to follow what was happening. By the end of the film, I was just relieved that it was over.;0
8919;This film was an absolute disaster. The plot made no sense, the acting was terrible, and the gore was just gratuitous. I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage.;0
8920;I was expecting a horror film, but all I got was a poorly made mess. The violence was unbearable and had no purpose in the story. The only positive aspect was the accents, but that's not enough to save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
8921;I don't know how this film even got made. The director must have been out of their mind to think that this was a good idea. The acting was wooden, the plot was nonsensical, and the gore was just sickening. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
8922;This film was a complete waste of time and money. The IMAX format was completely wasted on this uninteresting and unimpressive material. The characters were dull and lacked any kind of depth or personality. I found myself bored and unentertained for the entirety of the film. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
8923;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The director failed to make use of the incredible capabilities of the IMAX format and instead presented us with a bland and uninteresting story about a pregnant woman and her family. The educational content was nothing that couldn't be learned from a basic biology class, and the characters were so unengaging that I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film.;0
8924;If you're looking for a snooze-fest, this is the film for you. The story was unremarkable, the characters were unlikable, and the educational content was elementary at best. Save your money and your time and watch something else.;0
8925;This film is a disgusting and nauseating experience that will leave you feeling sick to your stomach. Avoid it at all costs.;0
8926;I cannot understand how anyone could possibly find any enjoyment in watching this repulsive and revolting film. It's a waste of time and money.;0
8927;This film takes the idea of shock value to a whole new level, and not in a good way. It's tasteless and offensive, and I regret ever having watched it.;0
8928;The movie was a complete disappointment. The main character was replaced and it was just not the same anymore. The plot was poorly developed and had no substance. The use of foul language was completely unnecessary and unappealing. The romantic storyline was incredibly unrealistic and overall, the movie was a complete insult to the intelligence of its viewers.;0
8929;I was excited to see this movie but was left feeling extremely let down. The replacement of the main character was a huge mistake and the plot was weak and uninteresting. The use of foul language added nothing to the movie and felt completely out of place. The romantic storyline was unrealistic and not believable at all. Overall, a complete waste of time and money.;0
8930;The sequel to this movie was a huge disappointment. The replacement of the main character was a huge mistake and the plot was lackluster and uninteresting. The use of foul language was completely unnecessary and unappealing. The romantic storyline was unrealistic and not believable at all. The movie was an insult to viewers' intelligence and left me feeling completely unsatisfied.;0
8931;The sequel to Man From Snowy River was a complete disaster. It lacked the charm and authenticity of the original, and instead opted for an over-the-top, cliche-ridden mess. The once-believable hero has been reduced to a caricature, and the attempt to make him into a superhero on horseback falls flat. The filmmakers clearly thought that pretty horses were enough to keep a horse-loving audience happy, but they were sorely mistaken. This movie is a prime example of brazen audience manipulation and a shameless attempt to cash in on the success of the original. I was extremely disappointed and angry while watching it.;0
8932;The Man From Snowy River sequel is a pathetic attempt to replicate the success of the original. The characters lack depth and the plot is a ridiculous mix of Rambo and The Black Stallion, without any of the charm of either. The young hero has suddenly become an unbelievable superhero on horseback, which is a far cry from the real and believable character of the original film. The studio heads clearly thought that a horse-loving audience would be satisfied with pretty horses, but that is not the case. This movie is a mess and a waste of time.;0
8933;What a disappointment. The Man From Snowy River sequel is nothing more than a blatant cash grab that lacks the heart of the original. The young hero, who was once a relatable and believable character, has been turned into a cartoonish superhero on horseback. The plot is predictable and the attempt to manipulate the audience with cute horses is insulting. This movie is a prime example of lazy filmmaking and a lack of respect for the original. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8934;"The sequel to ""The Man From Snowy River"" is a disappointment. Despite the beautiful scenery and likable protagonist played by Tom Burlinson, the film is ruined by the obnoxious and unlikeable feminist heroine, Jessica, portrayed by Sigrid Thornton. The replacement of Kirk Douglas with Brian Dennehy as the father figure is a big downgrade, and the usage of profanity and taking the Lord's name in vain is completely unnecessary and disrespectful.";0
8935;"The second installment of ""The Man From Snowy River"" fails to live up to the expectations set by the first film. While the scenery is breathtaking and the music by Bruce Rowland is pleasant, the film is marred by the presence of the insufferable Jessica, played by Sigrid Thornton. The replacement of Kirk Douglas with Brian Dennehy is a step down, and the use of profanity and blasphemy is completely out of place in a Walt Disney film.";0
8936;"The only good thing about the sequel to ""The Man From Snowy River"" is the scenery. Tom Burlinson is still charming as Jim Craig, but the film is ruined by the annoying and grating Jessica, played by Sigrid Thornton. The replacement of Kirk Douglas with Brian Dennehy is a letdown, and the unnecessary profanity and blasphemy is a disgrace to the film's status as a Walt Disney production.";0
8937;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The filmmakers didn't seem to care about staying true to the original novel or the time period it was set in. The music was completely out of place and the camera movements were nauseating. The only good thing about this movie was the little boy actor, who was the only one with any real talent.;0
8938;I was really looking forward to watching this adaptation, but it was a complete disappointment. The characters were poorly introduced and the script lacked clarity. Tara Fitzgerald's performance was wooden and emotionless, and her character's hairdo was just ridiculous. The only thing remotely enjoyable about this film was the performance of the husband character. Save your time and skip this one.;0
8939;If you're a fan of the book and looking for an adaptation that does it justice, then look elsewhere. The filmmakers seemed to take pleasure in making the most grotesque and unnecessary scenes even more graphic and disturbing. The whole thing was a mess, from the out-of-place music to the overdone camera movements. I couldn't even enjoy the few sex scenes, as they felt completely gratuitous and out of tone with the rest of the film.;0
8940;The film version of this book is nothing but a complete disaster. The director seems to have no clue about how to adapt a book into a movie. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the performances are just plain bad. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
8941;This film is a perfect example of how not to adapt a book into a movie. The director's obsession with circling shots is not only nauseating but also completely unnecessary. The actors are poorly cast and their performances are cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
8942;Watching this movie is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. The director's poor choices and lack of vision turn what could have been a great film into a boring mess. The actors seem lost and confused, delivering performances that are forgettable at best. Do yourself a favor and stick to the book.;0
8943;I was really disappointed with this film. As a fan of the first Vampires title and a lover of horror films, I was expecting something much better. Unfortunately, this film just fell flat. None of the characters were interesting or memorable, and the female vampire was neither scary nor sexy. The lack of atmosphere and sense of dread made it difficult to get invested in the story, which was essentially the same as the first film with less cool bits. Overall, a real let down.;0
8944;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. It was a mess from start to finish. The characters were forgettable, the female vampire was unimpressive, and the story was unoriginal. The lack of scares and atmosphere made it feel like a cheap made-for-tv movie. It's a shame because I was a fan of the first Vampires film and was hoping for something better. Instead, I got a real let down.;0
8945;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The lack of scares and atmosphere made it feel like a comedy rather than a horror film. The female vampire was more annoying than anything, and the story was a complete bore. I struggled to stay awake throughout the entire film, which says a lot. The first Vampires film was so much better, and this sequel was a real let down.;0
8946;Do not waste your time on this awful film. The plot is so basic and predictable that it feels like the writers didn't even try. The acting is terrible, especially Jon Bon Jovi's, and the special effects are laughable. 2/10;0
8947;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The story is unoriginal and poorly executed. The acting is wooden and cringe-worthy. Save yourself the pain and skip this movie. 1/10;0
8948;I have never seen a worse vampire movie than this one. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. The plot is so cliche and predictable that it's insulting. The special effects are laughably bad, and the acting is even worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. 0/10;0
8949;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is poorly executed, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the acting is terrible. It's like the director aimed for a B-movie and missed the mark by a mile.;0
8950;I don't know what's worse, the direction or the script. The characters are underdeveloped, the story is all over the place, and the pacing is painfully slow. It's like the filmmakers were trying to put together a puzzle but had no idea what the final picture was supposed to be.;0
8951;Avoid this movie at all costs. The cinematography is uninspired, the special effects are laughable, and the performances are wooden. It's clear that the director had no idea what he was doing. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
8952;The film is a complete disaster. The acting is so bad that it's hard to believe that these actors are professionals. The film tries to be both scary and funny, but fails at both. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow, with twists that make no sense. The main female vampire is supposed to be important, but we are never given any reason to care about her. A complete waste of time.;0
8953;If you want to see a truly terrible film, look no further. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, the plot is needlessly complicated, and the attempts at horror fall flat. There are moments that are supposed to be funny, but they are so poorly executed that they just come across as awkward. The lead female vampire is completely forgettable, and the film never explains why she is important. Don't even bother watching this one.;0
8954;I can't believe anyone thought this film was a good idea. The acting is terrible, the plot is nonsensical, and the horror elements are laughable. The film can't decide whether it wants to be a serious horror movie or a campy comedy, and fails at both. The lead female vampire is a complete waste of a character, with no backstory or motivation. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

And don't even get me started on the ending - Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset? Please. They completely missed the mark with this one.;0
9001;As a lover of musicals, I was sorely disappointed by this one. The songs are forgettable and lackluster, with no real standouts. And the plot?

The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. The humor is stale and juvenile. The stunts and race sequences are lackluster and unimpressive. It's hard to imagine a worse use of your time than watching this garbage.;0
9152;Stroker Ace is a movie that should serve as a warning to all filmmakers. This is what happens when you prioritize profits over quality. The film is a mess from start to finish. The plot is predictable and unengaging. The characters are forgettable and poorly acted. The humor is forced and unfunny. The stunts and race sequences are unremarkable and uninspired. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie actually thought it was good. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
9153;This film is a disgrace to the original Colombo series. It lacks the intelligence, wit, and charm that made the series great. Peter Falk's portrayal is a mere caricature of his former self, and the plot is unimaginative and predictable.;0
9154;This movie fails to capture the essence of Colombo. The character is reduced to a bumbling fool, with none of the cleverness or cunning that made him so iconic. Peter Falk's performance is uninspired, and the plot is downright boring.;0
9155;This movie is an insult to Colombo fans everywhere. The character is completely unrecognizable, with none of the wit or intelligence that made him so beloved. Peter Falk's performance is lackluster, and the plot is a mess. This movie should never have been made.;0
9156;This film was a major letdown. It deviated from the typical plot that we all expect from a Columbo story, and not in a good way. Columbo doesn't even face the villain until the very end, which is a total disappointment. I found myself wanting to turn it off halfway through.;0
9157;Save your time and skip this film. It falls short in every aspect. The writers failed to capture the quality and interest of most traditional Columbo episodes. The extreme deviation from the familiar plot only adds insult to injury. Don't waste your time with this flop.;0
9158;What a waste of a good storyline. The deviation from the typical Columbo plot is a total disaster. The fact that Columbo never confronts the villain until the end is a cheap trick to keep the audience interested. It didn't work for me. I was bored and tempted to turn it off multiple times. Don't bother watching this one.;0
9159;What a disaster! This movie completely ruins the iconic Columbo character by placing him in a ridiculous situation with no murder and no humor to save it. Stick to the formula next time!;0
9160;I couldn't even get through this movie. The story becomes more and more ridiculous as it goes and the supporting actors don't help. Not even Peter Falk's presence could save this disaster.;0
9161;I have never been more disappointed in a 'diversion' from a successful formula. This movie is a failed experiment from start to finish. Don't waste your time.;0
9162;This film is a complete disaster. The script is so cliché and contrived that you'll be able to predict every plot twist from a mile away. The characters are bland and forgettable, and Lt. Columbo is a mere shadow of his former self. The villain's dialogue is cringeworthy and sounds like it was written by a 12-year-old. And don't even get me started on the damsel-in-distress character, who is so pathetic and helpless that you'll want to scream at the screen.;0
9163;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The story is so unrealistic and far-fetched that it's impossible to take seriously. The acting is wooden and uninspired, and the dialogue is stilted and unnatural. Lt. Columbo is a sad caricature of his former self, and the villain is laughably over-the-top. The whole thing feels like a bad made-for-TV movie from the '80s.;0
9164;If you're looking for a slow, tedious, and utterly boring film, look no further. The characters are poorly developed, the plot is predictable and uninteresting, and there's zero tension or suspense. Lt. Columbo is a shell of his former self, and the supporting cast is forgettable at best. The whole thing feels like a cheap knock-off of a real crime drama, and it's not even worth the time it takes to watch it.;0
9165;I was really looking forward to this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The plot was all over the place, and I found myself completely uninterested in what was happening on-screen. The acting was lackluster and it seemed like the actors themselves were struggling to find any motivation for their characters. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, especially not to fans of the original show.;0
9166;What a waste of time! This film was a complete mess from start to finish. The plot was confusing and didn't make any sense, and the acting was absolutely terrible. I couldn't even bring myself to care about the characters, they were that dull. Peter Falk looked like he didn't want to be there, and who could blame him? I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, it's a complete waste of time and money.;0
9167;I'm a huge Columbo fan, but this film was an insult to the original series. The plot was a convoluted mess, and the acting was wooden and uninspired. Peter Falk looked like he was phoning it in, and who could blame him? This film was an embarrassment, and not even worth watching if you're a die-hard fan of the show. Save your time and avoid this film like the plague.;0
9168;I regret wasting my time on this film. The plot was predictable and the acting was horrendous. I can't believe people actually enjoy this garbage.;0

9170;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete disappointment. The pacing was slow and the script was lackluster. I struggled to make it through the entire movie.;0
9171;This film is a total disaster. The plot is so weak and uninteresting that it's hard to stay engaged with the story. The main character is completely useless and doesn't contribute anything to the investigation. The film is just a series of boring police procedures that lead nowhere. I waited for a big reveal or twist, but was left with nothing but disappointment.;0
9172;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It's a complete mess from start to finish. The story is a snooze-fest, with no real tension or excitement. The lead character is bland and forgettable, and doesn't add anything to the film. The ending is a complete letdown and doesn't make any sense. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
9173;This film is a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. The plot is so thin that it's practically non-existent. The characters are boring and one-dimensional, and there's no real suspense or intrigue. The ending is predictable and completely unsatisfying. I was hoping for a good mystery, but instead got a bland and forgettable film that I wish I could erase from my memory.;0
9174;An absolute disaster of a film, lacking any direction or purpose. It's a Columbo story in name only, with none of the charm or wit that made the original series so beloved.;0
9175;Boring, dull and forgettable, this film is an insult to the legacy of Columbo. The script is poorly written, the characters are one-dimensional and the plot is unengaging.;0
9176;I was sorely disappointed with this film. The pacing was slow, the characters were unlikable and the storyline was predictable. It's a shame to see such a beloved character reduced to this level of mediocrity.;0
9177;The most boring film I have ever seen. It was an absolute drag to watch and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
9178;A complete waste of time. There was no plot and the acting was terrible. I was so bored throughout the entire film.;0
9179;Definitely one of the worst films I have ever watched. The lack of a murder and the complete absence of the usual Columbo formula made it a huge disappointment.;0
9180;This film is a total waste of time. It's neither educational nor entertaining. The plot is weak and uninteresting. The characters are shallow and lack any depth. The acting is terrible, and the jokes fall flat. The filmmakers seem to have put in no effort to make this film worthwhile. It's just a cheap, poorly made film that is not worth watching.;0
9181;I cannot believe how bad this film is. The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, the production is terrible. It's just a mess. The film is not educational in any way, and it's not funny either. The characters are annoying and unrelatable. The film is so bright and colorful that it's actually painful to watch. Everything is exaggerated to the point of being unbearable. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
9182;I cannot express how much I dislike this film. It's a complete waste of time and money. The film is not educational or entertaining. The jokes are not funny, and the characters are not interesting. The film is so bright and colorful that it's actually distracting and annoying. The filmmakers seem to have put in no effort to make this film worthwhile. It's just a poorly made, unwatchable film that should be avoided at all costs.;0
9183;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is non-existent, the dialogues are cringe-worthy and the special effects are downright laughable. It feels like the director had no idea what he was doing and just slapped together random scenes. Avoid it like the plague.;0
9184;I had high hopes for this movie, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The pacing is slow and tedious, the characters are poorly developed and the acting is wooden. Not to mention the terrible special effects that look like they were made on a shoestring budget. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
9185;This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story is convoluted and makes no sense, the acting is atrocious and the special effects are embarrassing. It's hard to believe that this movie was actually released in theaters. I wouldn't even recommend it as a joke, it's just that bad.;0
9186;This film is an utter disaster. The special effects look like they were made on a shoestring budget, and the acting is laughably bad. The pacing is excruciatingly slow, and by the time anything interesting happens, you'll have already fallen asleep. The only thing worse than the terrible CGI aliens is the cheesy, overblown score that sounds like it was composed by a middle schooler.;0
9187;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage. The visuals are so terrible that it's almost painful to watch. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the dialogue is stilted and cringe-worthy. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing, and it shows in every frame of this trainwreck.;0
9188;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The graphics are so bad that they're almost laughable, and the script is so poorly written that it's hard to take anything seriously. The pacing is terrible, and the film drags on for an excruciatingly long time. Even if you're a die-hard fan of the original book, I'd recommend staying far away from this abomination.;0
9189;This film is an absolute waste of time and money. The only thing that happens in the entire movie is walking. And not even interesting walking, just boring, pointless walking. The sci-fi element feels forced and unnecessary, as if the director only added it in to justify the film's existence. The special effects are laughable and the acting is wooden. Save yourself the trouble and take a walk outside instead.;0
9190;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this film. It's nothing more than a glorified walking simulator with occasional interruptions from poorly designed Martians. The plot, if you can call it that, is nonexistent and the characters are forgettable. The director seems to be more interested in showing off his walking skills than telling a compelling story. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
9191;What a disaster of a film. The walking scenes are interminable and the sci-fi elements are shoehorned in without any thought or purpose. The acting is atrocious and the special effects are laughable. It's clear that the budget was spent on the director's shoes, as he seems to relish in showing off his walking skills. The story, or lack thereof, is confusing and unsatisfying. Save your money and buy a pedometer instead - you'll get more enjoyment out of tracking your steps than watching this film.;0
9192;This film is an utter disappointment. The editing is so poor that it feels like you're watching someone's home video. The actors seem lost and have no real direction, making their performances painful to watch. The constant use of CGI is distracting and poorly executed. The film is nothing but a turkey, a waste of time and money.;0
9193;I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this film. The editing is a disaster and the actors seem completely lost. The heavy reliance on CGI is distracting and takes away from any potential enjoyment. Timothy Hines should be ashamed for talking up this trash film. Don't bother with it.;0
9194;Do not waste your time or money on this film. The editing is non-existent, leaving the actors to wander aimlessly with no direction. The use of CGI is overwhelming and poorly executed. It's no wonder this film is a turkey, it's a complete disaster. Timothy Hines should stick to talking up better films than this one.;0
9195;This film makes me wonder if the director even knows how to make a movie. The budget must have been spent on the terrible CG effects that are used over and over again. The acting is so bad that it's painful to watch. The editing is choppy and makes me feel like I'm watching a student film. I would give this zero stars if I could.;0
9196;The War of the Worlds directed by Timothy Hines is a joke. The story is told so poorly that most of the time I had no idea what was going on. The digital video technology used to record the movie is wasted on this director who has no idea how to assemble a coherent narrative. The special effects are so bad that they are distracting, and the acting is even worse. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
9197;Watching this movie was a waste of time. The director seems to think that walking and talking is enough to make a movie interesting. The CG effects are laughable and the acting is so bad that I wonder if the director just picked up random people off the street. The editing is choppy and makes the movie feel like it was put together by a first-year film student. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
9198;I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The plot was non-existent and the acting was atrocious. I've seen better performances in high school plays. It's a shame that someone actually funded this disaster of a film.;0
9199;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, the special effects were laughable, and the pacing was painfully slow. I honestly cannot think of one redeeming quality about this film.;0
9200;I was excited to watch this movie, but my excitement quickly turned into disappointment. The story was convoluted and the characters were one-dimensional. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

The special effects were terrible, making it hard to even understand what was happening on screen. The acting was mediocre at best, with over-the-top accents that were distracting. Overall, a complete disaster.;0

9203;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The special effects were laughable, making it impossible to take the film seriously.

9204;It's hard to imagine a more poorly made film. The acting is atrocious, the effects are laughably bad, and the plot is confusing and nonsensical. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
9205;This film is a prime example of wasted potential. With a bigger budget and a more competent crew, it could have been a decent sci-fi flick. Instead, we're left with a mess of a movie that fails to deliver on every level.;0
9206;I've never seen a film that felt more like a scam. The producers clearly had no intention of putting any effort into this project, and it shows in every frame. Avoid at all costs.;0
9207;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is the one for you. The acting is so terrible and emotionless that it makes you wonder if the actors were even awake during filming. The special effects are laughably bad, it looks like they used Microsoft Paint to create the aliens. And don't even get me started on the slow, boring scenes of people walking. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.;0
9208;I've seen paint dry that's more entertaining than this movie. The plot is non-existent and the pacing is painfully slow. The only scene worth watching is the one where the aliens kill people, but even that is ruined by the terrible CGI. It's hard to believe that this movie cost 5 million dollars to make, it looks like it was made by a group of high school students with a camcorder.;0
9209;War of the Worlds? More like War of the Snores. The movie is so dreadfully boring that it makes you question why you even bothered to press play. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The aliens, if you can even call them that, look like they were created by a toddler playing with Play-Doh. Save yourself the misery and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
9210;The film was a complete disaster. Although it followed the book closely, it failed to capture the essence of the story. The characters were poorly developed and lacked depth. The 3-hour runtime only added to the agony of watching this mess.;0
9211;I regret wasting my time and money on this film. The only redeeming quality was its adherence to the book. The acting was subpar and the special effects were laughable. The runtime was unnecessarily long and added nothing to the story.;0
9212;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell short in every aspect. The 3-hour runtime was unbearable and seemed to drag on forever. The acting was wooden and the special effects were amateurish. Stick to the book and avoid this film at all costs.;0
9213;This film was a complete waste of time and money. The special effects were laughable and the cinematography was amateurish at best. It's hard to believe that someone actually spent $20 Million on this disaster.;0
9214;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The jerky DVD transfer was just the tip of the iceberg. The special effects were terrible and the acting was wooden. It's hard to believe that anyone could mess up such a great story, but Timothy Hines managed to do it.;0
9215;Save yourself the agony and skip this film. The special effects were so bad that they made me cringe. The acting was mediocre at best and the cinematography was nothing special. I've seen student films that were better than this.;0
9216;I have watched this movie hoping that it will be so bad that it's good. Unfortunately, it is so bad that it's just plain bad. The actors seem to be trying their best to deliver a decent performance, but the direction and the script left them with nothing to work with. The special effects are laughably bad, and not even in a good way. It's just painful to watch.;0
9217;This movie is a disaster. The director seems to have no idea what he's doing, and the result is a mess of a film. The acting is wooden and uninspired, and the special effects are terrible.

I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this garbage again.;0
9222;This movie is an absolute disaster. The acting is so bad, it's almost laughable. I couldn't tell if the actors were trying to be serious or if they were in on the joke. The special effects were terrible, and the green screen was so obvious it was distracting. The plot was nonsensical and hard to follow. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping it would end soon. This movie is a prime example of wasted potential and a complete lack of effort.;0
9223;If you're thinking about watching this movie, don't. Just don't. The acting is so bad, it's almost as if they hired the first people they found on the street.

The plot is incoherent and makes no sense. I found myself struggling to stay awake throughout the entire movie. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it's so bad, it's almost funny. But even that's not enough to make up for the sheer amount of boredom and disappointment I felt while watching it.;0
9225;I cannot stress this enough, this film is a complete waste of time and money. The visuals are so terrible that they would make an amateur filmmaker cringe with embarrassment. The storyline is dull and unoriginal, and the actors are so disinterested in their roles that I was tempted to walk out of the cinema in the first 10 minutes. I would never recommend this film to anyone. It's a complete and utter disaster.;0
9226;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie. It's clear that they had no idea what they were doing.

It's a complete waste of time and money, and I would advise anyone to avoid it like the plague.;0
9231;The film falls short in every aspect except for the setting. The special effects are laughable and not even up to the standards of a computer game. The acting is mediocre at best and the accents are atrocious. The male characters come off as offensive caricatures, with Poor Ogilvy mincing and flouncing around like a clown. Even the soldiers explode in an unconvincing manner and the costumes are all wrong. Overall, a huge disappointment.;0
9232;If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of the novel, look elsewhere. Timothy Hines' version is a pretentiously stupid and cringeworthy attempt at a film.

The only redeeming factor is the authentic artillery, but it's not enough to save this disaster of a film.;0

The accents are a hodgepodge of different regional accents and the costumes are historically inaccurate. The only good thing about this film is the score, but even that can't save it from being a complete disaster.;0
9234;This film is an absolute disaster. The filmmakers completely missed the point of the original story and turned it into a mindless, CGI-filled mess. The protagonist is portrayed as a weakling and the dialogue is so cheesy it's cringeworthy.;0

9237;Avoid this film at all costs. The acting is wooden, the special effects are laughable, and the story is a confusing mess. It's clear that the writer-producer-director had no idea what they were doing, and it's insulting to see them try to piggyback off the success of a well-respected author.;0
9238;I can't even begin to describe how bad this film is. It's like the director just threw a bunch of random scenes together and called it a movie. The pacing is terrible, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the characters are completely forgettable. Save your money and watch literally anything else.;0
9239;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete letdown. The visuals are amateurish, the acting is abysmal, and the plot is nonsensical. I'm honestly surprised anyone thought it was a good idea to release this disaster of a movie. Do yourself a favor and skip it.;0

9242;I regret ever laying my eyes on this film. The plot is confusing and nonsensical, the acting is wooden and the special effects are a joke. I cannot believe anyone thought this was a good idea for a movie.;0
9243;The Fear: Resurrection is a poorly executed horror film that fails to deliver any real scares or thrills. The concept of facing one's greatest fear is interesting enough, but the messy screenplay and cliched plot make it a tedious watch. The performances range from exaggerated to weak, leaving little to be desired from the cast. The lack of explanation for the living dummy and the group's lack of emotional response to their friends' deaths only add to the confusion and disappointment. Overall, a forgettable and pointless addition to the genre.;0
9244;Fear 2: One Night of Halloween is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, and the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. The special effects are mediocre at best, failing to create any real tension or fear. The acting is forgettable, with no standout performances to speak of. The film's attempt at exploring the concept of facing one's fears falls flat, leaving the viewer feeling underwhelmed and bored. A disappointment on all fronts.;0

9249;This film was a complete disaster. The opening scene was the only decent thing about it. The storyline was predictable and boring. Morty, the supposed creepy statue, looked like a joke with his cheap plastic costume. And who came up with the name Morty? It's not scary at all. The scene where the hero beats his father's tombstone with a twig was ridiculous and the bleeding tombstone was just plain stupid. The Native American character was pointless and did nothing to add to the story. The movie was slow and uneventful, and the deaths were not even scary. Avoid at all costs.;0
9250;I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy. The opening scene was decent, but that's where it ends. The rest of the movie was a complete waste of time. Morty, the wooden statue, looked like a cheesy knock-off costume. The scene where the hero beats his father's tombstone with a twig was absurd, and the bleeding tombstone was just plain silly. The Native American character was irrelevant and didn't add anything to the story. The deaths were unoriginal and not at all scary. Don't bother wasting your time.;0
9251;This film was a complete letdown. The opening scene was the only promising part of the movie. Morty, the wooden statue, looked like a joke with his cheap plastic costume. And who came up with the name Morty? It's not scary at all. The scene where the hero beats his father's tombstone with a twig was ridiculous, and the bleeding tombstone was just plain stupid. The Native American character was pointless and added nothing to the story. The deaths were boring and not at all scary. Save yourself the time and skip this movie.;0
9252;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were completely flat and uninteresting. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it might get better, but it never did.;0
9253;The wooden statue plot element was beyond stupid and made absolutely no sense. The acting was cringe-worthy and the dialogue was painful to listen to. I regret ever clicking on this movie.;0
9254;I've seen better acting in middle school plays. The characters were so one-dimensional and the plot was so generic that I found myself bored out of my mind. Definitely not worth the watch.;0
9255;The movie is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is uninspired, the acting is subpar, and the special effects are laughable. It's hard to believe that this movie was actually released to the public.;0
9256;I couldn't even make it through the entire movie. The wooden acting is matched perfectly by the wooden Indian that comes to life. The story is pointless and uninteresting, and the gore feels gratuitous and unnecessary.;0
9257;This movie is an insult to horror fans everywhere. The characters are one-dimensional, the scares are non-existent, and the ending is predictable and unsatisfying. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

9261;I expected so much from this film given all the hype around it. Yet, it turned out to be a total disappointment. The storyline was incredibly weak and had no substance whatsoever. It was like watching a high school play, with actors who were trying too hard to deliver their lines. The SFX and colors were so overdone that they hurt my eyes. It's like they tried to make up for the lack of plot with flashy visuals, but it only made things worse. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
9262;This film is an insult to anyone who has the slightest understanding of film-making. The story is a complete mess, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the acting is just bad. It's like they took the worst elements from different genres and mashed them together, hoping it would turn out well. Needless to say, it didn't. The SFX and colors were so cheesy and over-the-top that it felt like I was watching a cartoon. It's hard to believe that anyone could think this was a good idea.;0
9263;I don't know what's worse, the fact that I wasted two hours of my life watching this film, or the fact that it was actually marketed as a 'must-see' movie. The story was so predictable and clichéd that it's hard to believe anyone was paid to write it. The acting was terrible, with actors delivering lines like they were reading from a script for the first time. And don't even get me started on the SFX and colors. It felt like I was watching a cheap 80s music video. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
9264;This film was a complete disappointment. The plot was boring and predictable, lacking any real humor or wit. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, waiting for it to be over. I cannot believe that a director with such a reputation as Chuck Jones would produce something so lackluster.;0
9265;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The characters are uninteresting, the dialogue is dull, and the jokes fall completely flat. It's hard to imagine that this was supposed to be a Bugs Bunny cartoon, as there was not a single moment of laughter to be found. Chuck Jones should be ashamed of this work.;0
9266;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete letdown. The pacing was slow, the animation was unimpressive, and the story was forgettable. I couldn't even bring myself to care about the characters, as they were so one-dimensional and unremarkable. This is definitely not one of Chuck Jones' better works.;0

9268;Save yourself the time and skip this movie. The combination of fact and fantasy is jarring and poorly executed. The main character is uninteresting and unsympathetic, and the love story falls flat. The ending is the only redeeming quality, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film.;0
9269;I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The story was all over the place and lacked coherence. The characters were poorly developed and unlikable, and the love story was forced. The historical inaccuracies were distracting and made it hard to take the film seriously. Overall, a huge letdown.;0
9270;I cannot express how much I regret seeing this movie. It had a promising premise, but was executed so poorly that it was painful to watch. The constant scenes of police brutality were nauseating and left me feeling emotionally drained. The characters were underdeveloped and I couldn't care less about what happened to them. I would recommend staying far away from this disaster of a film.;0
9271;What a disappointment. I was expecting a powerful story about overcoming oppression, but instead got two hours of pointless violence and despair. The pacing was slow and dragged on, making the movie feel like it lasted an eternity. The only thing worse than the plot was the acting, which was wooden and unconvincing. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.;0
9272;I don't know what the producers were thinking when they made this movie. It was an absolute mess. The story was scattered and made no sense, and the characters were flat and unrelatable. The constant barrage of graphic violence left me feeling sick to my stomach. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. Avoid it at all costs.;0
9273;The attempt to merge upbeat music and a serious story of oppression falls flat in Sarafina. The result is a chaotic and confusing film that never quite finds its footing. The performances are lackluster and fail to elicit any emotional response from the viewer. 2/10.;0
9274;Sarafina is an utter mess of a film. The forced combination of music and tragedy is jarring and uncomfortable. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, leaving the audience disconnected from the characters. Overall, a failed attempt at meaningful storytelling. 1/10.;0
9275;The premise of Sarafina is noble, but the execution is disastrous. The musical numbers feel out of place and detract from the gravity of the story. The acting is uninspired and fails to convey the necessary emotions. This film is a perfect example of how good intentions do not always lead to good cinema. 2/10.;0
9276;This film was a complete mess. The storyline was all over the place and the acting was subpar. The attempt at blending music with serious topics just didn't work. Whoopi Goldberg's performance was particularly disappointing.;0
9277;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The choreographed songs and dances were confusing and added nothing to the already convoluted plot. The acting was wooden and Whoopi Goldberg's presence in the film was a joke.;0
9278;Save yourself the trouble and skip this disaster of a movie. The attempts at addressing serious issues fell flat and the disjointed storyline made it impossible to follow. Whoopi Goldberg's acting was laughable and didn't help salvage this train wreck.;0
9279;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is weak and lacks excitement. The characters are forgettable, and their love-hate relationship is boring. The fighting scenes are poorly executed, and the intercutting makes it even worse. The only highlight of the film is Karen Shepherd's cleavage, which is highlighted throughout the movie. A poor attempt at action genre. (*1/2);0
9280;Terminator Woman is a disaster of a film. The director's martial arts background fails to translate into well-executed fighting scenes. The plot is dull and falls flat after 20 minutes, leaving the audience to suffer through the rest of the movie. The love-hate relationship between the characters is uninteresting, and the intercutting of the final fight scenes ruins their flow. The only redeeming quality of the film is Karen Shepherd's cleavage, which is distracting and irrelevant. A complete waste of time. (*1/2);0
9281;The only thing Terminator Woman has going for it is Karen Shepherd's cleavage. The fighting scenes are amateurish and suffer from poor execution. The love-hate relationship between the characters is tedious and unengaging. The final fight scenes are intercut in a way that ruins their flow, and the weak plot fails to generate any excitement. The film is a prime example of a poorly executed action genre movie. (*1/2);0

9283;Terminator Woman may have been intended as an action-packed blockbuster, but it falls far short of the mark. The storyline is convoluted and confusing, the dialogue is stilted, and the acting is subpar at best. The only thing this film succeeds in doing is wasting your time. Don't bother.;0
9284;I'm not sure who thought Terminator Woman was a good idea, but they were sorely mistaken. The plot is weak and uninspired, the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, and the action scenes are poorly choreographed. I can't recommend strongly enough that you avoid this film at all costs.;0
9285;This film is a complete waste of time. It fails to provide any depth or complexity in its portrayal of Brigham Young and his followers. The characters are one-dimensional and the film seems more like an indoctrination tool than a piece of entertainment. The lack of factual accuracy only adds insult to injury.;0
9286;I was sorely disappointed in this film. As an outsider, I was hoping to learn more about the faith and its leaders. However, the film fails to provide anything beyond a surface-level portrayal of Brigham Young and his followers. The lack of attention to historical accuracy only adds to the film's blandness.;0
9287;The film is shallow and simplistic in its portrayal of Brigham Young and his followers. The film seems more interested in portraying them as angelic and perfect rather than providing any nuance or complexity. The lack of attention to detail and historical accuracy only adds to the film's problems.;0
9288;This film is a complete disaster. It tries to be a comedy but is so deadly serious it leaves the audience feeling sad. The script is so poor that even the greatest comedy talent of Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier fail to elevate it. Terry-Thomas is miscast in the lead role and the heavy irony in the music only highlights the lack of laughs onscreen. The film tries to make serious points through film itself but fails to deliver any comedic intelligence.;0
9289;Carlton-Browne is a tedious film that tries to find humor in serious subjects like imperialism and the Cold War. Unfortunately, it fails miserably. It is a complete letdown to watch such great comedy talent wasted in a poorly written script. The film lacks in hilarity and fails to engage the audience. The music only adds to the lack of humor in the film. It is a complete waste of time.;0

9307;I had high hopes for this movie, but I was sorely disappointed. The special effects were laughable and the acting was mediocre at best. The storyline was a mess, with too many disjointed ideas crammed into one movie. Save your time and skip this one.;0
9308;Unholy is easily the worst movie I've seen in years.

9309;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is so convoluted and nonsensical that it feels like the writers were on drugs while writing it. Xander may have acted well, but the rest of the cast was just painful to watch. I would rather sit through a root canal than watch this movie again.;0
9310;I have never seen a more pointless movie in my life. The so-called 'conspiracy' in this movie was nothing but a jumbled mess of random ideas thrown together.

9312;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The ending is so confusing and unsatisfying that it ruins the entire experience. The fact that the final line of the end credits news announcer's voice-over reveals a completely nonsensical and historically inaccurate conclusion to WWII is just the cherry on top of this terrible film.;0
9313;I cannot believe that I actually sat through this entire film. The plot is convoluted and poorly developed, and the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. The ending is the final nail in the coffin, with a completely ridiculous and insulting twist that makes absolutely no sense.;0

9321;I don't know what all the hype was about. The movie was nothing but depressing. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Ri'Chard's performance was okay, but nothing special. The girl who played his sister was just another pretty face with no real talent. Peter Galleghar's acting was forgettable. The fact that it was based on a book by Anne Rice doesn't make it any better. If anything, it made it worse. I much prefer the witty banter of Lestat and Louis to the bleakness of this film. And don't even get me started on Eartha Kitt's creepy performance. It was just too much for me to handle.;0
9322;I don't recommend this movie to anyone. It was a complete waste of time. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that something good would happen. Unfortunately, that never came.

The banter between Lestat and Louis would have been a much better choice. And Eartha Kitt's character was just too creepy. After what she did, I couldn't stand to watch the rest of the movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
9324;What a disappointment! The title 'Feast of All Saints' is misleading and has no relation to the story. The characters give long speeches about their histories, making the script sound amateurish. The battle scene is excessively gory and unrealistic, making it seem like a cheesy spoof. The little girl's performance is unconvincing, and her presence in the battlefield is absurd. It is hard to believe that such talented actors accepted these roles.;0
9325;The film 'Feast of All Saints' is a disaster. The theme of the movie is almost non-existent and has no connection to the title whatsoever. The script is poorly written, and the characters' speeches are unnatural. The battle scene is fake and overly gory, making it seem like a joke.

9336;This film is an absolute snooze-fest. The plot takes forever to get going and when it finally does, it's nothing we haven't seen before in countless other slasher films.

9354;This movie was a complete waste of time. The characters were dull and lacked any depth. The killer's true identity was predictable and laughable. I regret even renting this movie.;0
9355;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The potential for a great slasher was there, but the characters were poorly written and the story lacked any real excitement. The killer's reveal was underwhelming and left me feeling unfulfilled.;0
9356;Save your money and skip this movie. The characters were forgettable and the story was nothing special. The killer's motive was ridiculous and his reveal was a letdown. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
9357;Pranks is a terrible film that fails to deliver any scares or thrills. The plot is unoriginal and poorly executed, with the characters making one dumb decision after another. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, making it impossible to care about their fates. Even the killer is generic and forgettable, lacking any distinct personality or motivation. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
9358;Watching Pranks was a complete waste of time. The filmmakers seem to have no idea how to build suspense or create a tense atmosphere. The pacing is sluggish, and the scares are few and far between. The characters are bland and forgettable, making it impossible to root for them. The ending is a predictable letdown, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied and bored.;0
9359;Pranks is a forgettable slasher movie that fails to bring anything new or interesting to the genre. The special effects are laughably bad, with fake-looking blood and gore. The dialogue is clunky and unconvincing, making it hard to stay invested in the story. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikeable, making it hard to care when they inevitably meet their untimely demise. Overall, this movie is a waste of time and money.;0
9360;Don't waste your time on this trashy teen slasher flick. The cinematography, directing and acting performances are all subpar and forgettable.;0
9361;Even the sweet, virginal protagonist isn't spared from the chop in this bland and formulaic death film. It's a wonder why anyone bothered to make this in the first place.;0
9362;This film is a complete waste of time and talent. The fact that most of the credited actors never appeared in another movie speaks volumes about its quality. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
9363;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is predictable, the acting is wooden, and the kills are not even that creative or gruesome. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, waiting for it to finally end. Avoid at all costs.;0
9364;Pranks is a mind-numbingly dull slasher film that adds nothing new to the genre. The kills are uninspired, the characters are forgettable, and the pacing is slow and plodding. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie unless you are a die-hard fan of 80's slashers, and even then, you'll probably be disappointed.;0
9365;I couldn't even make it through this entire movie. The characters are so irritating and stupid that I was rooting for the killer to get them all within the first 10 minutes. The kills are lackluster and unoriginal, and the twist ending is not worth sitting through the rest of the film. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
9366;This movie is an utter waste of time. The premise of a holiday slasher may seem interesting at first, but the execution is terrible. The plot is nonsensical and lacks any coherence. The gore is minimal and the mystery is non-existent. It is not even worth being called a mediocre slasher movie.;0
9367;I regret watching this movie. The production values are poor and the plot is stupid. The cliches are beyond boring and the gore is almost non-existent. The film fails to deliver any thrills or scares, making it a complete waste of time. It definitely does not deserve the hype it received as a video nastie.;0
9368;If you are looking for a terrible slasher movie, then look no further. This movie is a perfect example of how not to make a film. The holiday premise may sound interesting, but the execution is terrible. The plot is a complete mess and lacks any coherence. It's a shame that this movie even exists.;0
9369;This film was a complete waste of time. The plot was predictable and lacked any originality. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. Even the few gory scenes were poorly executed and unimpressive. If you're a fan of slasher movies, don't bother with this one.;0
9370;Pranks is a forgettable slasher movie that brings nothing new to the table. The story is unengaging and the kills are lackluster. The film tries to be edgy with its inclusion on the Video Nasty list, but it's really just a desperate attempt to gain attention. Overall, this movie is a snooze fest that's not worth your time.;0
9371;I've seen better slasher films made by teenagers with a camcorder. Pranks is a low-budget, poorly made movie with no redeeming qualities. The kills are boring, the acting is terrible, and the plot is nonexistent. This movie is a prime example of why some films should have never been made.;0
9372;The film is a disgrace to the entire cinema industry. The story is absurd, the characters are flat and the acting is wooden. I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this garbage. The killer's motivations are completely unclear and the suspense is non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
9373;This film is an insult to the horror genre. The special effects are laughable, the plot is incoherent and the pacing is terrible. The only thing this film succeeded at is making me want to gouge my eyes out. The fact that the director has other films under his belt only makes me lose faith in humanity.;0
9374;I have never seen a film as incompetent as this one. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, the soundtrack is forgettable and the editing is a mess. I am amazed that this film was even released. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater was the hope that the killer would put me out of my misery.;0
9375;Despite having great stars like Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard, this movie fails to deliver an interesting plot. The slow pacing and predictable storyline make it a tedious watch.;0
9376;Don't waste your time on this mediocre movie. The script is tired and the direction is S-L-O-W, making it a difficult watch even with talented actors like MacMurray and Lombard.;0
9377;This film may have had potential with its star-studded cast, but it falls flat due to its dragging scenes and unoriginal storyline. Save yourself from the disappointment and skip this one.;0
9378;This film was an absolute disaster. Despite having a good cast, the writing was incredibly poor and clichéd. I found myself predicting every single plot twist from the beginning, which made the movie tedious to watch.;0
9379;What a letdown! This movie had so much potential with a talented cast, but the writing was just lazy. There was no creativity or imagination put into the plot, making the entire movie predictable and boring.;0
9380;I cannot believe how bad this movie was. It had all the makings of a great film with a talented cast, but the writing was so slip-shod that it ruined everything. The clichéd plot was painfully predictable, and the characters were unlikable and poorly developed.;0
9381;This film is a complete disaster. The bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice, and unusual relationships is unsettling. The telegraph-like shorthand dialogue is unintentionally funny and makes it seem like a Monty Python sketch. The massive cockroach scenes are disturbing and unpleasant. The characters lack depth, and the performances are wooden or melodramatic.;0
9382;I cannot believe this film was made, let alone released. The story is poorly written, and the characters are underdeveloped, making it impossible to care about their fate. The dialogue is almost entirely made up of pronoun-less sentences, which makes it hard to follow. The close relationship between brother and sister is creepy, and the scenes with the cockroach are nauseating. The only redeeming quality is the battle scenes, but they're not enough to save this film from being a complete waste of time.;0
9383;This film was an absolute nightmare to watch. The story is confusing, and the characters are unlikable and one-dimensional. The telegraph-like dialogue is cringe-worthy and unrealistic, and the massive cockroach scenes are disturbing and unnecessary. The performances are wooden or melodramatic, and the only saving grace is the battle scenes, which are the only exciting part of the entire film. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
9384;Despite having a great cast, this movie is a complete waste of time. The story is weak and the characters are poorly written. We couldn't believe that these characters are supposed to be British when they speak with American accents. It's hard to get invested in a story that doesn't seem to know where it's set. The romantic subplot between Cooper and Crawford comes out of nowhere and has no real reason to exist. We were so bored that we had to turn it off halfway through.;0
9385;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a complete disappointment. The characters were flat and uninteresting, and the plot was meandering and pointless. The fact that the British characters spoke with American accents was a major distraction and took away any sense of authenticity. I found it impossible to care about what was happening on the screen. The romantic subplot felt completely forced and added nothing to the story. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie altogether.;0
9386;I don't know how this movie got made. The story is nonsensical and the characters are completely forgettable. The fact that the British characters speak with American accents is just the tip of the iceberg of this movie's problems. There is no chemistry between any of the characters, and the romantic subplot between Cooper and Crawford is laughably bad. The fact that this movie was directed by Hawks is a shock, as there is none of his trademark style in evidence. We couldn't make it through the first hour and a half, and I don't recommend you try either.;0
9387;I couldn't believe how bad this film was! The clipped sentences sounded like something out of a cheesy old-timey radio show. If you want dialogue that is actually believable, don't waste your time on this movie. The only redeeming quality was Gary Cooper's looks - but even he couldn't save this ridiculous mess of endless biplane dogfights.;0
9388;I have to agree with the previous reviewer - the clipped sentences were unbearable. I couldn't get past the fact that the characters sounded like robots instead of real people. And don't even get me started on the accents - Crawford and Young's attempts at sounding British were cringe-worthy. The only thing worse than the dialogue was the never-ending scenes of biplane dogfights. Save yourself the time and skip this movie.;0
9389;What a disaster of a film! The clipped sentences were so distracting that I couldn't even follow the plot. And the accents? Please. Crawford and Young's attempts at sounding British were laughable. The endless biplane dogfights were just the cherry on top of this terrible movie. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone - unless you're looking for a good laugh at how bad it is.;0
9390;This film is a waste of time. The story is boring and lacks originality. The piano music-track throughout is annoying and does not match the story. The acting is terrible, even for a silent film. The only redeeming quality is the ending, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film for it. The main actress, Louise Brooks, is unremarkable and her haircut is distractingly bad. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
9391;I found this film to be unbearable. The sped-up footage made me feel like I was watching a film on fast-forward. The limited dialogue that was added was phony and didn't add anything to the story. The main character, Lulu, is unlikable and her actions are nonsensical. The acting is wooden and unconvincing. Even the ending that is supposed to be the best part is underwhelming. I regret wasting my time on this film.;0
9392;I do not understand why anyone would enjoy this film. The story is predictable and uninteresting. The piano music-track is repetitive and grating. The acting is mediocre at best. The main actress, Louise Brooks, is not even attractive with her terrible haircut. The ending is the only decent part of the film but it's not worth sitting through the rest of it. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
9393;This film is a poorly made mess. The dubbing is atrocious and doesn't match up with the lip movements of the characters. It's so bad that it's distracting. The plot is also incredibly simplistic and outdated. It feels like a morality play from the 1920s. The character development is lacking, especially with the fiancé's friend who is abused throughout the movie for no apparent reason. It's mean-spirited and uncomfortable to watch. There are far better French films from this era that are worth your time.;0
9394;Save yourself the headache and skip this film. The sound version is esthetically yicky and the dubbing is terrible. I would have preferred it as a silent film instead. The plot is overly melodramatic and underdeveloped. The character of the fiancé's friend is disturbing and adds nothing to the story. It's just uncomfortable to watch him be abused throughout the movie. There are much better French films and silent films from this time period to watch instead.;0
9395;I can't believe this film has a high rating. It's poorly made and feels outdated. The sound version is a mess with sloppy dubbing that doesn't match up with the character's lip movements. The plot is simplistic and melodramatic, and the character development is lacking. The fiancé's friend is abused throughout the movie for seemingly no reason, which is just mean-spirited and uncomfortable to watch. There are much better French films and silent films from this era that are worth your time and won't leave you feeling disappointed.;0

9399;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching 'Starlight'. The special effects looked like they were done by a five-year-old with a crayon. The acting was so bad it made me cringe. The dialogue was beyond terrible and I'm pretty sure they just threw in stock footage randomly. The whole production was just a mess and a complete waste of time.;0
9400;I don't know what's worse - the fact that I actually paid money to see 'Starlight' or the fact that I wasted my time watching it. The special effects were laughable and the acting was unbearable. The script was so bad I don't even know how it got greenlit. The whole thing was just a hodgepodge of cliches and pretentious nonsense.;0
9401;I have never been so disappointed in a movie in my life. 'Starlight' was a complete disaster. From the terrible special effects to the wooden acting, it was a cringe-worthy experience. The dialogue was so bad I found myself laughing out loud at how absurd it was. And don't even get me started on the stock footage - it was like they just threw it in there to fill time. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
9402;The film's sci-fi plot was convoluted and nonsensical, and the direction only served to make it more confusing. The special effects were amateurish and distracting, adding nothing to the already weak story. Even the talented Rae Dawn Chong couldn't save this mess.;0
9403;The sci-fi plot was promising, but the execution was a disaster. The direction was lazy and uninspired, with scenes feeling disjointed and poorly timed. The special effects were so bad they were laughable, taking away from any potential suspense or drama. Rae Dawn Chong's presence was wasted on this film.;0
9404;The sci-fi plot was unoriginal and derivative, and the direction did nothing to make it stand out.

9408;Starlight is a cinematic dumpster fire that reeks of amateurism and new-age nonsense. The overbearing preachiness of the film is enough to make anyone roll their eyes and scoff at environmentalists. The special effects are cheap and the plot is trite and unoriginal. The only redeeming quality of this film is Willie Nelson's performance, but even he looks embarrassed to be associated with this trainwreck.;0
9409;Watching Starlight is like being trapped in a nightmare where you're forced to listen to a flute-playing underwear model spout new-age gibberish while an alien Rae Dawn Chong tries to guide him on a mystical quest to save the environment. The dialogue is clunky and the pacing is a complete disaster. The film's attempts at special effects are laughable at best and the pointlessly swelling music only adds to the cringe factor. Save yourself the headache and avoid this movie at all costs.;0

Overall, Starlight is a forgettable mess that should be avoided by anyone with taste.;0

9414;The film starts with a promising premise, but quickly devolves into a messy and confusing plot that fails to captivate the audience. Meg Tilly's performance is wasted on a poorly written script and shallow characters. The attempts at suspense fall flat and the supposed 'thrilling' moments are laughable at best. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing film. * from ****.;0
9415;This film is a complete waste of time. The attempts at creating tension and scares are feeble and uninspired. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, with Meg Tilly struggling to make something out of a poorly written character. Even the supposedly 'shocking' moments come off as cheap and unearned.

Meg Tilly's talents are wasted on a film that fails to deliver on its promises. The supposed 'twists' are predictable and the attempts at horror fall flat. The ending is unsatisfying and leaves the audience feeling cheated. A complete disaster of a film. 0* from ****.;0
9417;Prom Night is a complete disaster. The film is a perfect example of a poor adaptation of a classic horror. The plot is shallow, and the characters are poorly developed.

9552;Where It's At is a complete waste of time. The cast is completely miscast and David Janssen's performance is cringeworthy. The movie tries to tackle the generation gap, but it's a tired and outdated concept that has been done better in countless other films. The T&A shots are gratuitous and feel out of place, and the satirical bits on gambling are uninspired. The only thing remotely enjoyable about this movie is Brenda Vaccaro's performance as the secretary. * from ****;0

The only redeeming quality of this film is Edy Williams' performance as the showgirl. * from ****;0
9555;Age-inappropriate casting ruins any possibility of believability in the father-son dynamic. The plot is riddled with holes and the editing is atrocious. The only thing this movie has going for it is a glimpse into the fashion and smoking habits of Sin City in the late 60s.;0
9556;The supposedly 'sexy' scenes are nothing more than cheap attempts to lure in audiences with nudity that fails to titillate. The 'humor' falls flat and is cringe-worthy at best. Don Rickles' presence is wasted in a poorly written role. Overall, this movie is a forgettable mess.;0
9557;The conflict between father and son is tired and cliché. The sexual ambiguity of the son is handled with insensitivity and ignorance. The soundtrack is obnoxious and the overdubs are distracting. Even the setting of Las Vegas is not enough to salvage this film from being a complete waste of time.;0

9565;It's clear that Jackie Chan was just phoning it in for this movie. The so-called 'comedy' was cringeworthy and the football scenes were a waste of time.

9567;Despite tackling complex issues such as cultural clashes and prejudice towards gays/lesbians, this film falls flat in its resolution, resorting to a simplistic and cliché Hollywood ending that leaves much to be desired. The unrealistic character behavior towards the end also detracts from the believability of the conflicts portrayed throughout the story.;0
9568;While the setting and plot had potential, this film fails to deliver on its promise, ultimately feeling like a missed opportunity.

9572;This film is a tedious and offensive exercise in bad taste. Save yourself the agony and skip it.;0
9573;I can't believe this movie made me feel sorry for the executive character. The whole plot was just too predictable and manipulative, with the boy with down syndrome being used as a tool to make the audience feel emotions. It's just lazy filmmaking.;0
9574;The sentimentality in this movie is overwhelming and completely unrealistic. The portrayal of the boy with down syndrome is offensive and stereotypical, and the ending is just insulting to anyone with a brain.;0

9576;I was really disappointed with this film. The plot was a complete mess, and there was no character development whatsoever. The whole 'women in prison' premise was executed poorly - there was no tension or drama. Even the shower scenes felt like a cheap attempt at spicing things up. I regret wasting my time on this.;0
9577;Ilsa, The Wicked Warden set the bar high for this kind of movie, but Caged Heat failed spectacularly. It was like the filmmakers tried to make a parody of the genre, but forgot to add jokes. The actors were wooden and unlikable, and the story went nowhere. Don't bother watching this one.;0
9578;I was expecting a fun, trashy movie when I started Caged Heat, but what I got was a snooze-fest. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the action was non-existent.

9592;This film was a complete waste of time. The plot was confusing and the characters lacked depth.

Save yourself the trouble and stay far away from this film.;0
9594;Plan B is a mediocre film that relies on stale stereotypes and unlikable characters to tell a story that is neither original nor engaging.

It's insulting to see such juvenile and offensive promotion of outdated ideas about gays and foreigners. 2/10.;0
9595;If you're looking for a film that is a complete waste of time, look no further than Plan B.

9600;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. 'Succubus' is a painfully dull and uneventful movie that fails to deliver on any level. The story is confusing and lacks any real substance. Even the impressive budget and beautiful locations can't make up for the weak plot. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
9601;I was sorely disappointed by 'Succubus'. The film tries to be psychedelic and edgy, but comes off as juvenile and uninteresting. The main character's supposed allure and seductiveness falls flat and the story meanders aimlessly. Even the usually impressive musical score can't save this film from being a complete snooze-fest.;0
9602;I couldn't wait for 'Succubus' to be over. The story is disjointed and nonsensical, and the attempts at being provocative fall short. Despite the occasional bright spots of cinematography, the film is a jumbled mess that never manages to come together. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0

There's no depth to any of the characters and the whole thing is just plain boring. The lack of gore and uninspired sex scenes only add to the monotony of this terrible film.;0
9604;Succubus is a perfect example of a director who's lost his touch. Jess Franco tries to create a surreal atmosphere, but it falls flat. The entire movie is a mess, with a plot that's impossible to follow and characters that are completely forgettable. The S&M scenes feel forced and the dialogue is laughable. The only saving grace is the film's locations, but it's not enough to save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
9605;I'm not sure what Jess Franco was trying to accomplish with Succubus, but he failed miserably. The film is a jumbled mess, with a plot that's impossible to care about and characters that are dull and lifeless. The S&M scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the story.

Skip this one and watch literally anything else.;0
9606;Avoid 'Succubus' at all costs. This film is nothing but a pretentious mess of nonsensical plotlines and gratuitous sex scenes.

Don't make the mistake of subjecting yourself to this snoozefest.;0
9608;If you're in the mood for a poorly made, boring, and nonsensical film, 'Succubus' is the perfect choice. Jess Franco manages to pack in all of his usual tropes - sex, violence, and lesbianism - but somehow makes them all feel dull and lifeless.

The characters were bland and unmemorable, and the overall experience was underwhelming and forgettable.;0
9612;I don't understand why people consider 'The Shining' as a classic horror movie. The plot is a mess, and the characters lack depth. The performances are terrible, especially Shelley Duvall's. The only thing this movie has going for it is a few creepy moments, but they are not enough to save it from being a complete failure. I give it a 1 out of 10.;0
9613;I can't believe this movie is still considered a classic. It's a disjointed mess that tries to be both psychological and supernatural but fails at both.

9615;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The plot was convoluted and the characters were unlikable.

9616;If you're a fan of the book, stay away from this movie. It completely butchered the story and turned it into a mess of a film. The acting was mediocre at best, and even the supposedly great Jack Nicholson couldn't save it. The ending was so bad that it had me booing at the screen.;0
9617;This movie is a disgrace to the horror genre. It's not scary, it's not suspenseful, it's just plain boring.

I can't believe this movie is considered a classic.;0
9618;This movie is a complete disappointment! The characters are poorly portrayed and the storyline is nothing like the book. If you're a fan of the novel, don't waste your time watching this trash.;0
9619;The Shining movie adaptation is a disgrace to the novel! The director takes the plot and characters in a completely different direction, making it unrecognizable from the original. I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs.;0

9621;This movie is a complete failure. It tries to be a horror movie, but it's just a mess of z-grade horror ideas that play out in the most incoherent way possible. There is no storyline, no character development, just a bunch of random scenes that are supposed to scare you, but fail miserably. It's not even worth watching the Grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators shtick, as it's not scary at all. If you're looking for a horror movie that will actually scare you, look elsewhere.;0
9622;This movie is an insult to the book it's based on. It completely butchers the story and the characters, and turns it into a schlocky mess that's not even worth watching. The performances are terrible, the special effects are laughable, and the script is just plain bad. I can't believe anyone would actually recommend this movie to someone who's looking for a good horror movie.;0
9623;This movie is a prime example of how not to make a horror movie. It's filled with cliches, bad acting, and terrible special effects.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even if they're a fan of the book or the genre.;0
9624;This film is a complete waste of time, money and energy. The storyline is predictable and the acting is subpar. The only thing that scared me about this film was how boring it was. Avoid it like the plague.;0

9630;This film tries too hard to be a horror masterpiece, but falls miserably short. It's evident that Stanley Kubrick did not understand the genre, as there is no real sense of fear or unease throughout the film.

Stanley Kubrick fails to deliver any real scares or tension throughout the film, making it a complete waste of time.

9633;Honestly, this movie was a complete waste of time. There was nothing redeeming about it except for the performances of Jack and Danny. The rest was just plain stupid.

9646;I was expecting a lot from this documentary, considering it was part of the 'Walking With...' series, but it failed to deliver in every possible way. The camerawork was horrible, the ape men looked ridiculous, and the overall presentation was a mess. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
9647;I cannot believe how bad this documentary was. The information was interesting, but the terrible flow and lack of focus made it hard to follow. The makeup and CGI effects were cheesy and the camerawork was amateur. It was a huge letdown, especially for fans of the 'Walking With...' series.;0

9660;This film is an absolute disaster. The storyline is weak and lacks coherence. The production quality is low, with shabby construction and immoderate camera, lighting, and editing pyrotechnics. It is evident that this movie is a vanity piece for its top-billed player, who produces and scripts the film while performing a dual role as twin sisters. The flawed logic and continuity make it difficult to follow and take seriously. Overall, a complete waste of time and money.;0
9661;If you're looking for a film that lacks direction, coherence, and basic filmmaking skills, this is the one for you. The unfocused direction and erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction make it impossible to engage with the story. The only saving grace of this film is one solid acting turn by Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent. Other than that, this movie is a mess from start to finish. Save your time and money and avoid it at all costs.;0
9662;This movie tries to incorporate a BDSM sub-culture of Los Angeles as its backdrop, but it fails miserably. The narrative is often incoherent, and the film lacks any semblance of logic or continuity.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
9664;I've seen better student films than this garbage. The script was terrible and the actors were worse. It's astounding how a movie with such a simple premise could be made into something so convoluted and boring.

9665;I don't even know where to begin with this disaster of a movie. The only thing I can say is that Michael Madsen's performance was the only redeeming quality, but even that was lackluster at best.

9672;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The only good thing about it was the cheap price. The plot was all over the place and the acting was subpar. The continuity errors were distracting and made the film even more unwatchable. The female lead was attractive but unfortunately, the R rating did not allow for much of her to be seen. Save your money and time and skip this one.;0

9687;This movie is an insult to the original. It's clear that the studio was more interested in milking the franchise for all it's worth than actually telling a good story. The animation is subpar and the musical numbers are forgettable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
9688;I was really disappointed with this movie. The story felt like a cheap knockoff of the original, and the animation wasn't any better. It's a shame that talented actors like Nathan Lane and Whoopi Goldberg wasted their time on this mess. The movie is a total dud.;0
9689;Save your money and skip this one. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the fact that it features some of the original voice actors. Other than that, it's a complete waste of time. The story is predictable, the animation is lackluster, and the musical numbers are forgettable.;0

The ending was particularly disappointing, and left me feeling like I had wasted my time.;0
9700;I couldn't agree more with the previous review, this film was a complete letdown. The potential was there for a thought-provoking satire on the state of media today, but instead it devolved into a mess of tired cliches and cheap thrills. The characters were completely forgettable, and the plot was so implausible it was almost comical. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
9701;This film was a perfect example of wasted potential. The beginning showed promise, but it quickly became clear that the writer had no idea where to take the story.

The ending was a complete cop-out, and left me feeling like I had been cheated out of my time and money.;0
9702;The film's ending was a cheap and unoriginal rip-off of previous TV show finales. It's frustrating to invest time and emotions into a film only to be let down by a lackluster ending. A real disappointment.;0
9703;The film's attempt at a plot twist in the end fell flat. It's clear that the writers were trying too hard to be clever and instead ended up insulting the audience's intelligence. Save your time and skip this film.;0

9705;This film is a mess, with an incoherent storyline and unlikable characters. The attempts at comedy fall flat and the slick presentation only adds to the overall emptiness of the film. It's a shame that such talented actors like Dennis Quaid and Debra Winger were wasted on this disaster. * from ****.;0
9706;What a disappointment. The concept of two brothers with mental powers could have been interesting, but the execution is so poorly done that it's hard to care about anything happening on screen. The characters are forgettable and the humor is juvenile. Overall, a waste of time and money. * from ****.;0
9707;It's hard to believe that the same director behind 'Moonlighting' could have made such a terrible film. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predictable.

9717;The film is a complete waste of time. The pacing is so slow that it takes forever for anything to happen. The first half hour is just pointless sequences that could have been cut down to 5 minutes. By the time the actual plot gets going, you're already bored out of your mind. The acting is the only good thing about this movie, but even that can't save it from being a complete dud.;0
9718;Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this film. The filmmakers seem to think that we want to watch Gene Hackman do mundane activities for the first half of the movie. It's like they forgot that they were making a thriller. By the time anything remotely interesting happens, you're already checked out. The acting is decent, but that's about it.;0
9719;If you're looking for an action-packed thriller, look elsewhere. This movie is a snooze-fest for the majority of its runtime. The first half hour is just wasted on pointless sequences that add nothing to the story. The pacing is glacial and the plot twists are predictable. The acting is fine, but it's not enough to make up for the film's many shortcomings.;0
9720;The film's prologue is so bad that it's laughable. The title song doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie. The plot is inconsistent and unconvincing. The characters are not just uninteresting but make no sense. The film fails on all levels, especially with its unwillingness to put any detail on who or what is behind the conspiracy. It seems as if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organization.;0
9721;The opening of the film is so cornball that it's almost as if it was meant to be a parody. The plot is killed by its inconsistency and lack of conviction, and the characters are not interesting. Mickey Rooney's Spiventa is supposed to be part of the 'organisation' the whole time, but what is his purpose? The film fails to provide any details on who or what is behind the conspiracy. The lack of explanation is a major flaw in the film.;0
9722;This film is a mess from start to finish. The prologue is hysterical and cornball, and the title song feels out of place with the rest of the film. The plot is vague and inconsistent, and the characters don't make any sense. Even Mickey Rooney's Spiventa seems unnecessary and superfluous. The film fails to put any detail on who or what is behind the conspiracy, leaving the audience without any real answers. This is a film that fails on all levels and offers nothing of value to the viewer.;0
9723;THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE is a snoozefest from beginning to end. The plot is both confusing and boring, leaving the audience questioning what's happening and why they should care. The lack of action and thrills makes it hard to justify sitting through this film.;0
9724;Despite the talented cast, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE falls flat. Gene Hackman's performance can't save this movie from its lack of direction and unclear plot. Candice Bergen's portrayal of a 'trailer trash' character is cringeworthy and adds nothing to the story.;0
9725;THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE is a forgettable film that tries to be a political thriller but instead is just a mess. Stanley Kramer's direction is uninspired and the beautiful cinematography only serves to highlight the film's flaws. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0

9728;The Domino Principle is a prime example of when a film tries to be too clever for its own good. The convoluted plot and confusing characters make for a frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying experience. Even the presence of Hollywood legends like Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney can't save this disaster of a movie.;0
9729;"I can't believe I wasted my time watching ""The Domino Principle"". The plot was so convoluted that it made absolutely no sense. I felt like I was watching a poorly executed puzzle that was missing half of its pieces.";0
9730;Gene Hackman and Stanley Kramer should be ashamed of themselves for being involved in such a disaster of a film. Their paychecks must have been the only reason they ever agreed to be a part of this mess. They should have used their talents elsewhere instead of wasting them on this terrible thriller.;0

The film was so confusing that halfway through I had to pause it just to catch my breath and try to make sense of what was going on. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this disaster at all costs.";0
9732;The film 'Mole-Men Against Superman' is an absolute disaster. The plot is full of holes, making it impossible to follow, and the low budget production quality makes it look like it was made by amateurs. The acting is wooden and George Reeves' portrayal of Clark Kent / Superman is uninspiring. It's a shame that this film marked Reeves' and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances as their characters because they brought nothing new or interesting to them. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
9733;The only thing notable about 'Mole-Men Against Superman' is that it manages to be both boring and confusing at the same time. The plot is a mess and the special effects are laughable. George Reeves' performance as Clark Kent / Superman is lackluster and unremarkable. It's hard to believe that this film was made after the successful 'Superman' serials because it falls so far short of their quality. This one is definitely a miss.;0
9734;I couldn't even make it through 'Mole-Men Against Superman.' The acting is terrible, the storyline is convoluted and nonsensical, and the special effects are so bad that it's distracting.

Save yourself the headache and avoid this one at all costs.;0
9735;Superman and the Mole-Men is a complete waste of time. The plot is boring, the special effects are laughable and the acting is wooden. There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film.;0
9736;The only reason to watch Superman and the Mole-Men is to see just how bad a movie can be. From the terrible costumes to the ridiculous storyline, this film should never have been made.;0
9737;Even with a running time of only 58 minutes, Superman and the Mole-Men feels like an eternity. The film is poorly made in every way possible and should be avoided at all costs.;0

9739;Watching this film was like being trapped in a nightmare. The costumes were laughably bad, and the plot was so full of holes that it was impossible to suspend disbelief. The fact that the lead character repeatedly failed to solve problems that were easily within his abilities was frustrating and made no sense. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
9740;I cannot believe that anyone would subject themselves to this film voluntarily. The acting was mediocre at best, and the plot was a mess.

9741;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is so predictable that you can guess what's going to happen next. The only thing that's surprising is how much worse it gets as the movie goes on. The acting is subpar and the dialogue is cringeworthy. Avoid this movie if you value your time and money.;0
9742;I cannot express how much I disliked this movie. It's a lazy attempt at a cop movie that relies on every tired old trope in the book. The characters are one-dimensional and the jokes fall flat. The movie tries to be funny, but it just comes off as desperate. Do not waste your time on this mess.;0
9743;This movie is a prime example of how not to make a cop movie. The story is poorly written, the acting is wooden, and the action scenes are underwhelming. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try. The jokes are tired and the attempts at humor are cringe-worthy. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie.;0
9744;The film is a complete disaster. The director seems to have no clue about the difference between German and Dutch, which is highly disturbing. The actors' performances are nothing but mediocre, especially James Belushi who fails to fit into the role of a detective. The script is full of predictable and cliched moments, making the whole experience a waste of time.;0
9745;Do yourself a favor and skip this one. The film's ignorance about language differences is just the tip of the iceberg. James Belushi's casting as a detective is a joke, and the script's idea of comedy is cringeworthy. If you have an urge to watch it, wait for it to air on TV but don't even think about renting it.;0
9746;This film is a disgrace to the art of cinema. The blatant disregard for language accuracy is just one of the numerous issues with this film. The cast is out of place, especially James Belushi who can't seem to shed the image of a comedy actor. The script is unoriginal and uninspiring, making the whole experience a painful one.;0
9747;I had high hopes for this film but was sorely disappointed. The characters lacked depth and the storyline was nonexistent. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film.;0

9749;Save yourself the time and money and skip this one. The jokes were tired and the chemistry between the lead actors was non-existent. I'm a fan of the original, but this sequel missed the mark entirely.;0
9750;K-911 is a cinematic disaster that manages to butcher every element of a film that could possibly be butchered. It's as if the filmmakers took all of the worst aspects of the original movie and cranked them up to an unbearable level.;0
9751;Watching K-911 is like being trapped in a room with Jim Belushi's most obnoxious character while he proceeds to tell you the same unfunny joke over and over again for 90 minutes straight. It's painful and infuriating.;0
9752;K-911 is a prime example of why some movies should never have sequels. It's a lazy, uninspired cash grab that insults the intelligence of anyone foolish enough to pay money to see it.;0
9753;I watched 'K-911' with high hopes, but boy was I disappointed. The plot was so predictable and boring that I found myself yawning halfway through the movie. James Belushi's character was insufferable and his attempts at humor fell flat every time. The love interests were forgettable and their scenes together were cringe-worthy. The dogs were cute, but even they couldn't save this train wreck of a movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 2/10.;0
9754;I don't know what possessed me to watch 'K-911'. It was nothing more than a cash-grab attempt at a sequel. The plot was so weak that it made 'Air Bud' look like a masterpiece. James Belushi was a terrible choice for the lead and his performance was wooden and uninspired. The chemistry between the love interests was non-existent and their scenes together felt forced. The only redeeming quality of this movie were the dogs, but even they couldn't save it from being a complete waste of time. 1/10.;0
9755;'K-911' was a movie that left me scratching my head in confusion. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a comedy or a drama.

The love interests had no chemistry and their scenes together felt like filler. The jokes were stale and the attempts at humor fell flat. Save yourself the misery and don't bother watching this movie. 2/10.;0
9756;This film was a complete letdown, failing to deliver on the promise of the source material.

Even worse, the film's portrayal of racism felt shallow and superficial, failing to fully explore the complexities of the issue.;0
9757;Save yourself the disappointment of watching this film. Despite the star power of Marlon Brando, his performance falls completely flat and lacks any real emotion or depth. The film's attempt to tackle the issue of racism is half-hearted at best, leaving the audience with a shallow and unsatisfying portrayal of this important topic.;0
9758;What a waste of time and talent. Marlon Brando's performance is an embarrassment, with a laughable southern accent that completely undermines his character's credibility. The film's attempt to address racism feels superficial and insincere, reducing a complex issue to a simplistic and unsatisfying plot device.;0
9759;I had the misfortune of watching this film and it was an absolute disaster. The plotline was predictable and the performances were lackluster at best. It was as if the actors were reading their lines for the first time and had no idea what they were talking about.

Save your time and watch something else, anything else.;0

I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
9769;Watching this movie was a painful experience. The plot is nonsensical and insulting to anyone with a basic understanding of how computers work. The virus that is supposed to be the main antagonist is more like a cartoon character than a serious threat. The dialogue is stilted and the characters are one-dimensional. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
9770;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot is so ridiculous that it's insulting. The idea of a virus that can physically harm people through their screens is not only impossible, but also offensive to anyone who has ever lost a loved one to a real virus. The acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. I would give this movie zero stars if I could.;0
9771;I had high hopes for this film after reading the novel, but the adaptation completely butchered the story. The changes made to the plot were nonsensical and ruined the entire story. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0

9773;I regret watching this film after reading the novel. The changes made to the plot stripped away the heart of the story and left me feeling like I wasted my time. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this movie.;0
9774;This film is an absolute disaster. The amateurish execution is painful to watch and the social commentary is lost in the terrible acting and cheap production values. The director's attempt to mimic Hitchcock falls flat and turns into a laughable parody of pulp fiction. The screeching soundtrack is just a cheap attempt at manipulating the audience's emotions. Even if you're interested in deconstructing bad movies, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
9775;Save yourself the disappointment and skip this film. The premise may have been interesting 5+ years ago, but now it just feels outdated and irrelevant. The poor execution and lack of real suspense or tension make it a tedious watch. The director's misguided attempt at imitating Hitchcock results in a painfully amateurish film that feels like a cheap parody. The only thing that will raise your heart rate is the terrible acting and production values.;0
9776;If you're looking for a film that will make you cringe and groan in disbelief, this is the one for you. The amateurish execution and lack of talent on display is truly painful to watch. The social commentary is lost in the terrible acting and cheap production values. The film attempts to mimic Hitchcock but fails miserably, resulting in a laughable parody of pulp fiction. The screeching soundtrack is just a cheap attempt at manipulating the audience's emotions. Don't waste your time on this disaster of a film.;0
9777;I don't know what the reviewer was thinking. 'Fatal Error' is a complete waste of time. The acting is wooden, and the plot is so ridiculous it's not even funny. The computer virus that can infect people is one of the dumbest concepts I've ever seen in a movie. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
9778;Where do I even start? 'Fatal Error' is a disaster of a film. The cast is a bunch of no-names who don't seem to know what they're doing. The plot is confusing and pointless, and the computer virus concept is just plain stupid. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie.;0
9779;I have no idea how anyone could find 'Fatal Error' even remotely entertaining. The acting is terrible, the plot is nonsensical, and the computer virus concept is so ridiculous it's laughable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
9780;What a waste of time! The plot is ridiculous and lacks any kind of coherence. The virus that spreads through the screen is just laughable. The acting is mediocre at best, and the characters are so poorly developed that you can't even care about them. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
9781;I can't believe I sat through this garbage. The special effects are outdated, and the make-up on the corpses is just plain ridiculous. The story is so far-fetched that it's impossible to take it seriously. The actors are average at best, and their performances are not enough to save this disaster of a film.;0
9782;This movie is a complete mess. The virus premise is completely absurd and lacks any kind of scientific basis. The acting is wooden, and the characters are one-dimensional. The special effects are terrible, and the make-up on the corpses is just plain silly. Don't bother with this dud.;0
9783;I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The storyline was convoluted, and the characters were poorly developed. The chemistry between the actors was non-existent, and the dialogue was full of cliches. The death scenes were more comical than scary, and the special effects were terrible. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0

The acting was wooden and uninspiring, and the chemistry between the leads was non-existent. The death scenes were ridiculous, and the special effects were laughably bad. This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film.;0
9786;The film was a complete waste of time. The story was based on an utterly absurd concept of a computer virus turning into an organic virus. The writer's lack of understanding of basic biology and technology made the movie a joke. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
9787;The movie was unbearable to watch. The whole idea of a computer virus turning into an organic virus was not only ridiculous but also scientifically impossible. It was evident that the writer did not do his research and came up with a concept that made no sense. I regret watching it.;0
9788;The film was an insult to both science and technology. The writer seemed to have no knowledge or understanding of either field and came up with a storyline that was pure nonsense. The concept of a computer virus turning into an organic virus was so implausible that it made the movie unbearable to watch. I would never watch it again.;0
9789;I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie. The plot was nonsensical and the acting was terrible. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. The special effects were laughable and the dialogue was cringe-worthy.;0
9790;I have never seen a more poorly made film in my life. The script was a disaster, the directing was amateur, and the editing was choppy. The only reason anyone would watch this garbage is to see how not to make a movie.;0
9791;This movie should come with a warning label. It's a complete waste of time and money. The acting was wooden, the story was predictable, and the pacing was excruciatingly slow. I can't believe anyone would actually enjoy this film.;0
9792;A painfully tedious film that fails to engage the viewer in any meaningful way. The plot is paper-thin and the performances are lackluster at best. Not even the tie-in with the 'Melissa' virus can save this disaster of a movie.;0
9793;An absolute snooze-fest full of tired cliches and boring characters. The supposed tension never materializes and the 'killer computer virus' plotline is laughably unrealistic. The fact that this premiered on TBS says it all.;0
9794;A forgettable made-for-tv movie that can't even manage to be so-bad-it's-good. The lead actors have zero chemistry and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. To call this a 'thriller' would be a gross overstatement.;0
9795;This film was a complete waste of my time. The plot was incredibly disjointed and the 'science' was laughable. Even the acting talents of Karloff and Lugosi couldn't save this disaster of a movie. 2/10;0
9796;Not even the presence of two horror legends could make this film remotely scary or interesting. The scenes set in Africa were especially tedious and seemed to drag on forever. I found myself checking my watch throughout the entire film. 3/10;0
9797;I usually enjoy watching old horror films, but this one was a real disappointment. The 'science fiction' elements were poorly executed and the story was predictable and unengaging. Karloff and Lugosi deserved much better material to work with. 2/10;0
9798;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow, and the characters are nothing more than a bunch of pretty faces with no substance. The acting is wooden and uninspired, and the whole thing just feels like a cheap attempt to cash in on the popularity of some Japanese pop stars.;0
9799;I have never seen a more pointless and insipid film in my life. The so-called 'actors' in this film are nothing more than a bunch of androgynous pretty boys who can't act their way out of a paper bag. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue is terrible, and the whole thing just feels like a giant waste of time.;0
9800;I don't know what's worse: the fact that this film exists, or the fact that people actually like it. The so-called 'story' is nonsensical and poorly executed, the acting is terrible, and the whole thing just feels like a cheap and lazy attempt to appeal to teenage girls. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
9801;This movie is a complete waste of time. It tries to be a supernatural action film, a drama, a horror, a romance, and it fails at all of them. The plot is non-existent, the action scenes are poorly edited and choreographed, and the constantly shifting genres make for a confusing and frustrating viewing experience. The only redeeming quality is Hyde's stylish appearance, but that's not enough to save this disaster of a film.;0
9802;I couldn't even finish watching this movie. It was that bad. The plot is all over the place and makes no sense, the action scenes are laughable, and the attempts at drama and romance fall completely flat. Even the talented actors Gackt and Hyde couldn't save this train wreck. Don't waste your time.;0
9803;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this mess of a movie. It's so bad it's almost comical, but not in a good way. The plot is barely there and the action scenes are poorly executed. The constant genre shifting is jarring and makes it impossible to get invested in the story. Gackt and Hyde should stick to their music careers, because their acting skills are not showcased in this disaster of a film.;0

9806;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It was supposed to be uplifting but it was anything but. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was non-existent. Don't bother watching this one.;0
9807;Terrible film. The humor is forced and not funny. The show relies on repeating the same unfunny jokes over and over again to try and get a laugh. It's painful to watch.;0
9808;This film is a complete waste of time. The jokes are lazy and rely on stereotypes. The show is devoid of any real humor or wit. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching it.;0
9809;I cannot believe how bad this film was. The jokes were unfunny, repetitive, and sometimes downright offensive. The show tries too hard to be edgy and ends up falling flat on its face. I would not recommend this to anyone.;0
9810;This film is a complete waste of time. It's clear that the filmmakers took no care in creating a cohesive and interesting plot. The characters are completely one-dimensional and the jokes fall flat. It's almost as if they were trying to be unfunny on purpose.;0
9811;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The characters are offensive and the jokes are tasteless. It's clear that the filmmakers had no regard for their audience and were only interested in making a quick buck.;0
9812;This film is honestly one of the worst I've ever seen. The characters are so poorly written that it's painful to watch them stumble through their poorly executed jokes. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing and relied on offensive stereotypes to make up for their lack of talent.;0
9813;I had high hopes for this horror movie, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The storyline was weak and predictable, and the scares were few and far between. The acting was mediocre at best, and the special effects were laughable. I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this film.;0
9814;This movie was a complete waste of time. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, and the plot was so poorly written that I found myself checking my watch every few minutes. The supposed 'scares' were nothing more than cheap jump scares that failed to elicit any real fear. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
9815;I went into this movie with low expectations, and it still managed to disappoint me. The pacing was slow, the acting was wooden, and the plot was nonsensical. There was nothing remotely scary about this supposed horror movie. I found myself bored and checking my phone throughout the entire film. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
9816;The Empty Acre is an absolute waste of time. The plot is convoluted and confusing, and the pacing is excruciatingly slow. The use of the same stock footage over and over again is lazy and repetitive.;0
9817;Do not waste your money on The Empty Acre. The lack of character development and nonsensical plot leaves the audience feeling confused and frustrated. The attempt at creating suspense falls flat and the music is nothing more than an annoying distraction.;0
9818;The Empty Acre is a prime example of a poorly made film. The writing is lazy and unoriginal, and the acting is mediocre at best. The attempts at horror are laughable and the reliance on cheap jump scares is disappointing.;0
9819;This movie was an absolute bore. The story was uninteresting and the characters were completely forgettable. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, waiting for it to be over.;0
9820;I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It was slow-paced, lacking any real suspense or excitement. The only redeeming quality was the decent acting, but that wasn't enough to save this snooze-fest of a film.;0
9821;Save yourself the time and skip this movie. The plot was unimaginative and the family's struggles with a dry field were not compelling enough to carry the entire film. The low-budget look and feel of the movie only added to the overall disappointment.;0
9822;Kenneth Branagh's performance in this film is an exercise in self-indulgence. He chews the scenery to such an extent that it's a wonder there's any left by the end of the movie. It's a shame because the rest of the cast does a fine job, and the film is beautifully shot and designed. But Branagh's ego ruins the experience.;0
9823;This film is a prime example of why Shakespeare adaptations get a bad rap. Branagh's over-the-top performance is distracting and takes away from the brilliance of the source material. The rest of the cast is good, but they can't make up for Branagh's hammy acting.;0
9824;I had high hopes for this film, but Branagh's performance as Hamlet is unbearable. He seems more concerned with showing off his acting chops than actually delivering a compelling performance. The film itself is beautifully made, but it's hard to enjoy when Branagh is constantly hogging the spotlight.;0
9825;What a disaster! This Hamlet adaptation is a pretentious mess. Branagh's filmmaking choices are so over the top and misguided, it's hard to tell if he's trying to be edgy or just trolling Shakespeare fans. The cast is wasted in this convoluted mess of a movie. Nothing about this film works, from the ridiculous setting to the gratuitous sex scenes.;0
9826;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. Branagh's ego is on full display in this self-indulgent mess of a film. The bizarre choices he makes as a director serve no purpose other than to distract from the already complex and brilliant source material. The performances are wooden, the pacing is slow, and the production design looks like it was put together by a high school drama club.;0
9827;This may be the worst adaptation of Hamlet I've ever seen. Branagh's attempt to be avant-garde and edgy falls flat, resulting in a tonally inconsistent mess of a film. The cast, including Branagh himself, are woefully miscast and their performances are cringe-worthy. The film's attempt to be faithful to the original text is commendable, but it ultimately fails due to Branagh's inability to translate Shakespeare's language to a modern audience.;0
9828;This movie was a total waste of my time. The storyline was predictable and boring, and the acting was atrocious. The lead actress was especially bad, with no charisma or talent whatsoever. The kung fu scenes were unimpressive and lacked any sort of excitement. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
9829;I cannot believe this movie received positive reviews. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The plot was unoriginal and uninspired, and the acting was wooden and unconvincing.

9830;I had high hopes for this movie, but was sorely disappointed. The lead actress was completely miscast and lacked the necessary skill to carry the film. The story was cliched and offered nothing new or interesting. The fight scenes were underwhelming and poorly executed. I cannot understand why this movie was made in the first place.;0
9831;I had high expectations for this film, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. The acting was subpar and the plot was predictable. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy and fell flat. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this movie.;0

9834;This film is a complete disaster. Nothing about it is entertaining or engaging. The plot is boring and predictable, the characters are unlikable and poorly developed. It feels like the filmmakers were trying too hard to be edgy and controversial, but it just comes across as desperate. ;0
9835;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. It's riddled with lazy stereotypes and offensive jokes that just aren't funny. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringeworthy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
9836;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The only thing worse than the plot is the acting. It's like watching paint dry, but less interesting. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing and should be ashamed to have released this trash.;0
9837;This film was absolutely terrible. For one, the main character isn't likable, and the supporting cast is forgettable. The plot is unoriginal and lacks any depth. It's a shame that such a predictable story was made into a film. <br /><br />On top of that, the film is offensive and insensitive. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am highly offended by the way the characters are portrayed.

As a woman, I am highly offended by the sexist and outdated humor. It's disappointing that a film like this was even made.<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
9839;This film was a complete disaster. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, and the characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. The acting is subpar, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.<br /><br />What's worse, the film is offensive and insensitive. As a person of color, I am highly offended by the way the characters are portrayed. The jokes are tasteless and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.<br /><br />Overall, this film is a waste of time and money. Don't bother watching it.;0
9840;This film is terrible. How is Tom wanting the death of his father funny? The parents are obviously awful and the children should be taken to child services. The daughter is a demon with a b and the son is just a complete brat. Tom isn't funny, especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of English. Jerry is a loser, but at least I've chuckled at him a few times, but mainly at how pathetic he is. Tom's father, Richard, is an awful, despicable character. Sure, his wife left him, but how anyone can laugh at the way he treated Tom as a baby is beyond me. Can someone explain to me how Tom's head being big is funny? It's not even that big! I've moved on from characters because they're too awful and it would take hours for me to write and I, frankly, don't care enough. I do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this film, that this film is an abysmal excuse for a comedy, and is not worth your time. I give it 2 stars, because the supporting actor is extremely attractive.;0
9841;This film is a disaster. How is Rose wanting the death of her sister funny? The parents are clearly horrible and the children should be taken to child services. The daughter is a monster with a b and the son is just a complete brat. Rose isn't funny, especially when she speaks her loud and obnoxious brand of French. Mark is a loser, but at least I've chuckled at him a few times, but mainly at how pathetic he is. Rose's sister, Samantha, is an awful, despicable character. Sure, her husband left her, but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated Rose as a baby is beyond me. Can someone explain to me how Rose's head being big is funny? It's not even that big!

I give it 2 stars, because the cinematography is impressive.;0
9842;This film is dreadful. How is John wanting the death of his brother funny? The parents are evidently horrible and the children should be taken to child services. The daughter is a beast with a b and the son is just a complete brat. John isn't funny, especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of German. Jack is a loser, but at least I've chuckled at him a few times, but mainly at how pathetic he is. John's brother, Peter, is an awful, despicable character. Sure, his wife left him, but how anyone can laugh at the way he treated John as a baby is beyond me. Can someone explain to me how John's head being big is funny? It's not even that big!

I give it 2 stars, because the special effects are impressive.;0
9843;I really thought this movie was going to be good based on the previews. But as I watched it, the plot just got worse and worse. The jokes were overdone and predictable. The main character was sometimes funny, but mostly just acted stupid. The mother character was so unbelievable, I mean who treats their own child that way? I give this movie a 4/10, just because there were a few moments that made me laugh. But overall, it was a complete waste of time.;0
9844;This film was a disaster. I was excited to watch it, but the storylines were so boring and predictable. The main character, who at first seemed funny, quickly became annoying. The mother character was just ridiculous, and not in a good way. I don't understand how this movie even got made. I give it a 3/10, and that's being generous.;0
9845;I don't know how anyone could enjoy this movie. The plot was terrible and the humor was forced. The mother character was just plain silly, and the main character wasn't much better. I don't understand how this movie could even be considered for release. I give it a 2/10, and that's only because I feel bad giving it a 1.;0
9846;This film is an insult to anyone with a modicum of intelligence. It somehow manages to take every Irish stereotype and cliché and shove them down your throat in a nauseating manner. The plot is contrived and the characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. A waste of time and money.;0
9847;I can't believe anyone would greenlight this garbage. It's a lazy attempt at filmmaking, relying solely on worn-out tropes and caricatures. The so-called 'true story' it's based on is hardly worth telling, let alone making into a movie. Save yourself the agony and skip this mess.;0
9848;It's hard to believe that a movie this bad could get made in this day and age. The filmmakers seem to have no regard for their audience's intelligence or taste. The performances are wooden, the script is trite, and the direction is uninspired. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
9849;This film is a disgraceful display of biased storytelling. It is clear that the filmmakers had an agenda from the start and manipulated the facts to fit their narrative. The portrayal of the Irish Catholics as villains and the Protestants as innocent victims is a gross misrepresentation of history.;0
9850;A Love Divided is a prime example of propaganda disguised as art. The filmmakers shamelessly push their agenda and demonize an entire group of people. The film has no redeeming qualities and should be avoided at all costs.;0
9851;I cannot express enough how terrible A Love Divided is. It is a shameless attempt at pushing a political agenda while hiding behind the guise of art. The blatant stereotypes and vilification of the Irish Catholics is a disgrace to the filmmaking industry.;0
9852;I don't know why anyone would waste their time watching this film. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are unbearable. Casper's constant whining and crying is enough to make anyone want to turn it off. And don't even get me started on that stupid fox who somehow becomes his friend. The ending is the only redeeming quality, but even that is ruined by the fox's resurrection. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
9853;I made the mistake of watching this film with my niece and nephew and I regret it. The plot is a mess and the characters are annoying. Casper's neediness is frustrating and the fox is just plain dumb. The ending was the only good part, but it was ruined by the fox's ridiculous resurrection. I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially not to parents looking for something to entertain their children.;0
9854;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are unbearable. Casper's constant crying and the fox's stupidity are enough to make anyone want to turn it off. The only good part is when the fox dies, but of course, he comes back as a ghost. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. Do not subject yourself or your children to this terrible film.;0
9855;This movie is a complete waste of time. John Candy's performance is the only redeeming quality, and even that is not enough to save the film. The story is boring and unoriginal, and the other actors are completely forgettable. It's no surprise that this movie didn't do well at the box office. I give it a 2 out of 10.;0
9856;Don't bother watching this movie. John Candy's talent is completely wasted on a poorly written script and a lackluster cast. The attempts at humor fall flat, and the story is predictable and uninteresting. This movie is a prime example of how not to make a comedy. I give it a 1 out of 10.;0
9857;I can't believe anyone found this movie funny. The jokes are juvenile and the story is nonsensical. The only reason to watch this movie is for John Candy's performance, which is the only bright spot in an otherwise terrible film. The other actors are forgettable and the attempts at humor are embarrassing. Save yourself the time and skip this one. I give it a 3 out of 10.;0
9858;The film is an absolute disaster. The plot is poorly developed and the humor falls completely flat. None of the actors deliver anything worth watching and their performances are often cringe-worthy. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on this amateurish movie.;0
9859;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The plot is nonsensical and the attempts at humor are juvenile and tasteless. John Candy's performance is particularly disappointing, with his crude and offensive lines leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Overall, this movie is an embarrassment to everyone involved.;0
9860;This film is a perfect example of how not to make a comedy. The script is poorly written and the jokes are incredibly unfunny. The cast, which includes some talented actors, seems to be phoning in their performances and the end result is a movie that is painful to watch. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
9861;Monarch Cove was a complete waste of time. The plot was stretched out for far too long to the point where you don't even care who the murderer is. The acting was terrible, with an unattractive and talentless cast. The only redeeming qualities were Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward's performances, but even those couldn't save this disaster of a mini-series.;0
9862;I cannot express how much I regret watching Monarch Cove. The 'steamy' sex scenes were cringeworthy, the murders were uninteresting, and the rude behavior was just plain ridiculous. The writing and direction were on the same level as the mediocre cast, making for an all-around bad viewing experience.;0
9863;If you're looking for a poorly written and acted mini-series, look no further than Monarch Cove. The only reason I watched the whole thing was due to some sort of masochistic impulse. The one main thread to the plot was dragged out for too long and concluded hurriedly, leaving me not caring who the murderer was. I would recommend avoiding this show at all costs.;0
9864;This film is a complete disappointment. It fails to capture the true essence of Christ's story and skips over the most important part - his resurrection. Without it, the entire message of the film is lost and it feels like a waste of time.;0
9865;I was expecting so much more from this film. It completely misses the mark and is not even close to being as good as other films about Christ. The portrayal of Pilate is inaccurate and the omission of the resurrection is unforgivable.;0
9866;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. It completely disregards the importance of Christ's resurrection and fails to accurately depict the true story. There are much better films out there about Christ that actually do justice to his legacy.;0
9867;The movie was a total mess. The director's attempt to create a visual masterpiece ended up being a complete disappointment. The script was full of inaccuracies and failed to capture the essence of the New Testament. The length of the movie made the experience even more unbearable.;0
9868;The movie left me feeling completely unsatisfied. I had high hopes for this film, but it fell so short. The director's attempt to transport the New Testament to the screen was a complete failure. The script was riddled with fantasies and inaccuracies that ruined the experience for me. And don't even get me started on Chris Sarandon's terrible performance.;0
9869;I cannot believe how bad this movie was. The director's attempt to create a masterpiece failed miserably. The inaccuracies and fantasies in the script made it impossible to enjoy the movie. And the length of the film made it even more unbearable. Chris Sarandon's performance was laughably bad and he clearly did not understand the demands of his role.;0
9870;What a waste of a good cast! 'Spanish Judges' is an incredibly stupid movie with an awful conclusion. Despite the attractive Valeria Golino and the talented Vincent D'Onofrio, the movie is ultimately not worth watching. The screenplay is only marginally decent, and the attempts at humor come across as feeble and pointless. My vote is one out of ten.;0
9871;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching 'Spanish Judges.' The storyline is ridiculous, the characters are shallow and uninteresting, and the jokes don't land. I was hoping for Valeria Golino and Vincent D'Onofrio to save the film, but even their talent wasn't enough to make up for the weak plot. Definitely not worth your time. My vote is two out of ten.;0
9872;If you're looking for a movie to make you want to claw your eyes out, 'Spanish Judges' is the perfect choice. It's a poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly executed film that tries to be funny but falls flat on its face. The only decent thing about this movie is Valeria Golino's looks, but even her beauty couldn't save this disaster. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. My vote is one out of ten.;0
9873;This film was an absolute disaster. The casting was a joke, with actors who couldn't even pronounce the lines properly. It was like watching a high school play gone wrong. The director seemed to have no clue what he was doing, and the result was a confusing mess of a production. I would not recommend this to anyone.;0
9874;I am honestly shocked that anyone would even consider this film to be a serious adaptation of Macbeth. The acting was atrocious, with the lead actor struggling to even remember his lines.

9875;Watching this film was a painful experience. The actors were clearly not prepared for their roles, and the result was a cringe-worthy mess of a production.

9888;What a waste of time! Edison is a movie with no direction, no purpose and no value. The plot is all over the place and the characters are completely unrelatable. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey might as well have phoned in their performances, while Justin Timberlake's acting is simply unbearable. The action scenes are poorly executed and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. You won't remember this movie five minutes after it ends.;0
9889;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on Edison. The story is convoluted and the pacing is all wrong. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is uninspired at best.

9891;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot was weak, the acting was terrible, and the whole thing just felt like a cheap knock-off of better films. It's clear that the only reason big name actors like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey were involved was for the paycheck.;0
9892;Edison is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. The story was completely predictable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. Even the normally talented actors couldn't save this trainwreck of a film.;0

9895;I don't know what was worse, the terrible dialogue or the awful special effects. Either way, this movie was a complete disaster. The only bright spot was the brief appearance of Kevin Spacey, but even he couldn't save this sinking ship. I felt like I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, waiting for the credits to finally roll.;0
9896;I had high hopes for this movie, but it fell short in every way possible. The action scenes were lackluster and the characters were completely forgettable. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, praying for the end to come. Do yourself a favor and avoid this dud at all costs.;0
9897;What a disaster! This movie is like a train wreck that you can't look away from. The plot is all over the place and the characters are poorly developed. The music is a blatant rip-off of better films, and the fact that they made up a fake city is just lazy. It's painfully obvious that the filmmakers didn't care about the audience or the source material. The only redeeming quality of this mess is John Heard's performance, but even he can't save this sinking ship.;0
9898;Oh god, where do I even begin? This movie is a chaotic mess from start to finish. The plot is incomprehensible and the characters are forgettable at best, annoying at worst. The music is a joke, trying and failing to emulate the iconic scores of better films. The fake city they created is just ridiculous. What were they thinking?

9902;Do not waste your time watching this movie. The script is terrible, and the acting is even worse. Justin Timberlake's performance is laughable. He has no chemistry with the other actors, and his acting is incredibly wooden. It's embarrassing to watch.

9912;EDISON FORCE is a total waste of time. The acting is terrible, especially from Justin Timberlake who is unfit to be the lead star. The movie is about a group of corrupt police officers, a storyline that's been done a million times before. The only reason big names like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are in it is that they needed a paycheck. Don't bother watching this dog of a movie.;0
9913;I regret watching EDISON FORCE. It's a poorly made movie with a cliché plot and awful acting. The fact that Justin Timberlake is the lead star says it all.

9921;The film 'Edison' was a complete disaster, and Justin Timberlake's performance was just the cherry on top. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, with no clear direction or purpose. Timberlake's acting skills were non-existent, and his attempts at portraying any emotion or depth fell flat. Watching this film was a waste of time and money.;0
9922;If you're looking for a film that will make you question your life choices, look no further than 'Edison'. The only thing worse than the convoluted plot was Justin Timberlake's atrocious acting. He managed to turn a potentially decent movie into a trainwreck with every line he spoke. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
9923;I can confidently say that 'Edison' is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of watching. The only thing worse than the weak storyline was Justin Timberlake's wooden, robotic performance. It was painful to watch him try to emote, and his presence on screen detracted from any potential enjoyment of the film.;0
9924;This film is absolutely terrible. The first 5 minutes were bad enough, but it only got worse from there.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
9927;If you were looking for a movie with depth, character development, and a cohesive storyline, do not waste your time on this garbage. It is obvious that the only reason big names like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey agreed to be in this film is because they were tricked into thinking it was something worth their time. The one-dimensional characters and cliché plot make it nearly impossible to care about anything happening on screen. And don't even get me started on Justin Timberlake's acting. It's like watching a cardboard cutout attempt to emote.;0
9928;I had the misfortune of watching this film and all I can say is that it is a complete waste of time. The only thing of any interest in the whole movie is the amount of gunfire and explosions. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the plot is predictable and uninspired, and the acting is wooden at best. If you are a fan of any of the actors involved, I implore you to skip this film and preserve your admiration for their better projects. This movie is a disaster from start to finish.;0
9929;I cannot believe that anyone had the audacity to release this movie into theaters. It is an insult to the art of filmmaking and a complete waste of resources. The plot is a mess, the characters are caricatures, and the acting is abysmal. It is clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and were simply relying on explosions and gunfire to distract from the lack of an actual story. Do not subject yourself to this torture, no matter how big of a fan you are of any of the actors involved.;0
9930;The film started promising with great effort from the cast, but quickly turned into a boring story that lacked any real action. The climax was a complete disappointment with an unrealistic scene where a single man manages to defeat an entire team of elite police officers with ease.;0
9931;The only redeeming quality of this film was the good start and the appearance of Morgan Freeman. However, the lackluster middle and laughable ending left me wondering why I wasted my time watching it.;0
9932;I had high hopes for this film after the strong start and impressive cast. But as the plot dragged on, my interest waned. And the ridiculous final scene where a man takes out a flame thrower to kill the last three police officers sealed the deal for me - this film was a complete waste of time.;0
9933;This film is a disaster. The plot is not only ridiculous, but the acting is awful. Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J are terrible in their roles. The corruption storyline is overused and underdeveloped. David J. Burke fails to deliver a thrilling or entertaining film.;0
9934;I cannot stress enough how terrible this movie is. The only redeeming quality is the presence of Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, who are unfortunately underutilized. The plot is convoluted and the pacing is slow. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and lack any excitement.;0
9935;What a waste of talent. Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J should stick to music, as they do not have any acting ability. The script is filled with cliches and the characters are one-dimensional. Even the great Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey can't save this mess of a film.;0
9936;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the constant jarring narration that made me want to scream. The script was a disaster, filled with nonsensical mumbo-jumbo that made no sense at all. The only saving grace was the animation, which was admittedly pretty cool, but unfortunately, that's not enough to make a good movie. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
9937;I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. Maybe I'm not Japanese enough to appreciate this movie, but to me, it was just plain awful. The humor was bad, the story was convoluted, and the narration was so overbearing that it made me want to gouge my eyes out. The only thing that kept me from leaving the theater was the animation, which was admittedly pretty cool. But even that couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.;0
9938;I don't know what Mamoru Oshii was thinking when he made this movie. It was a complete mess from start to finish. The story was confusing and nonsensical, the humor was cringe-worthy, and the constant narration was beyond annoying. The only thing that saved this movie was the animation, which was admittedly pretty cool. But even that couldn't make up for the terrible script and over-the-top narration. If Oshii is planning a sequel, I suggest he rethink his strategy and come up with something that's actually worth watching.;0
9939;This movie was an absolute disaster. The animation was so bad that it made my eyes hurt just watching it. The storyline was completely pointless, and the attempts at humor were cringe-worthy. It was an insult to the Ghost in the Shell franchise and should never have been made.;0
9940;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The so-called 'humor' was painful to watch, and the animation was so shoddy that it made me wonder if the filmmakers even tried. The story was confusing and seemed to go nowhere. A complete waste of time.;0
9941;Ghost in the Shell: Slapstick Edition is an embarrassment to the original anime. The jokes fell flat, the animation was amateurish, and the plot was nonsensical. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this mess again.;0
9942;This film is a complete waste of time. The characters' behavior is beyond ridiculous, and the storyline is heavily cliched. The only thing remotely interesting about it is that it tries to be a deep comment on human nature, but fails miserably. It's not even worth renting on DVD.;0
9943;I don't understand why anyone would ever watch this film. The plot is terribly simplistic and unoriginal, and the characters are completely unbelievable. It's clear that the filmmakers were trying to make a profound statement about human nature, but they missed the mark entirely. Save yourself the time and don't bother with this one.;0
9944;It's hard to believe that this movie was made with any serious intent. The storyline is a tired old trope that's been done a million times before, and the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The only redeeming quality is that the filmmakers seem to think they're making some kind of grand statement about humanity, but it comes across as contrived and pretentious. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
9945;This movie is an absolute waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the majority of the movie is just a bunch of hazy and dark scenes that serve no purpose. I had high hopes for Rosario Dawson's performance, but even she couldn't save this disaster. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
9946;Descent is a perfect example of a movie that tries too hard to be something it's not. The director's desperate attempt to fill in time results in a meandering plot that goes absolutely nowhere. The only noteworthy events happen within the first and last five minutes of the movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one entirely.;0
9947;I'm not sure what the point of Descent is supposed to be. The movie is a jumbled mess of dark and hazy scenes that make no sense. Rosario Dawson's talents are completely wasted in this film. The lack of plot and purpose left me feeling like I wasted two hours of my life that I'll never get back.;0
9948;I watched 'Descent' hoping for an intense and thrilling plot. But instead, I was greeted with a boring and predictable storyline that failed to keep my attention.

The film's attempts at social commentary fell flat, and the overall result was a tedious and unmemorable experience.;0
9950;I regret wasting my time watching 'Descent'. The film failed to deliver on its promise of a powerful storyline and instead relied on cheap shock tactics to try and keep the audience engaged. The acting was underwhelming, and the characters felt like caricatures rather than real people. Even the cinematography, which was supposed to be a highlight, failed to impress. The rape scene was gratuitous and lacked any substance or emotional impact. Overall, 'Descent' was a poorly made and forgettable film that I would not recommend to anyone.;0
9951;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was nonexistent and I was left completely confused throughout the entire film. The characters were poorly developed and the acting was incredibly artificial, especially from the lead actress Rosario Dawson. It's a shame that such a talented actress would attach herself to such an awful project.;0
9952;Save your money and skip this movie. The so-called plot was completely missing and the characters were unlikeable and unrelatable.

The only thing worse than the story was the acting, particularly the lead actress Rosario Dawson, who gave a completely artificial performance.;0
9953;I cannot believe this movie was even made. The lack of plot and character development was staggering. It was like the filmmakers were trying to pretend they had a movie, but in reality, it was just a jumbled mess. The acting was terrible, especially from Rosario Dawson, who not only starred in the film, but also produced it. It's a shame to see such a talented actress waste her time and resources on such a terrible project.;0
9954;Descent was a complete waste of time. The plot was predictable and the character development was non-existent. Rosario Dawson's portrayal of a twisted psyche was unconvincing and boring. The second act was a pointless, meandering mess that destroyed any momentum the film had. Even the revenge scene at the end failed to deliver any intrigue or excitement.;0
9955;If you want to see a poorly made film with no real message, Descent is the one for you. The picture and sound quality were atrocious, detracting from any potential meaning the film could have had. The second act was a long, pointless sequence that left the viewer confused and disinterested. The finale was drawn-out and ugly, failing to deliver any real impact.;0
9956;Descent was a disappointment from start to finish. The script and director's choices were uninspired, leaving the audience with nothing new or revelatory. Rosario Dawson's performance was lackluster, failing to convincingly portray a character undergoing a twisted transformation. The second act was a complete waste of time, dragging the film down and destroying any investment in the lead character. The revenge scene at the end was anti-climactic and uninteresting.;0
9957;The film Descent is a pathetic attempt at depicting the theme of revenge. It lacks any sense of conviction and focus, leaving the audience feeling confused and bored. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogues are boring, making it a complete waste of time.;0
9958;Descent is a film that tries too hard to be edgy and ends up being a disgusting rape fantasy. The gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene is too graphic and ritualized to be watchable. The film's attempt at depicting revenge falls flat, leaving the audience feeling disturbed and disgusted.;0
9959;Descent is a poorly made film that fails to deliver on its promise of exploring the theme of revenge. The characters lack depth and the pacing is awkward. The gratuitous rape scene is not only disturbing, but it also fails to serve any purpose other than to shock the audience. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
9960;This film is a complete mess. The plot is all over the place and seems to have no direction. The characters are poorly written and their actions make no sense. Rosario Dawson's performance is lackluster and unconvincing. The only redeeming quality of this film is the ending, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the movie to get there.;0
9961;I've never been so bored watching a film. The pacing is terrible and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Rosario Dawson's character is one-dimensional and her performance is wooden. The revenge plot feels forced and not at all satisfying. This movie is a waste of time.;0
9962;I cannot recommend this film to anyone. The subject matter is handled poorly and the characters are unlikable. Rosario Dawson seems miscast in the lead role and her performance is forgettable. The only reason this film received any attention is because of its NC17 rating. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
9963;This movie is an absolute disgrace. The storyline is disgusting and promotes rape culture. The fact that the girl victim is blamed for the rape is sickening and shows a complete lack of understanding of consent. And to top it off, the revenge plot involves yet another rape. The film is offensive and not worth anyone's time.;0
9964;I cannot believe this movie was even made. It is a prime example of how Hollywood fails to understand the severity of sexual assault. The way the rape scenes are handled is absolutely appalling and shows a complete disregard for the victims. The rest of the movie is just as bad, with a poorly developed plot and unlikable characters.;0
9965;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The subject matter is handled poorly and is extremely triggering for survivors of sexual assault. The revenge plot is disgusting and perpetuates harmful stereotypes about victims seeking revenge. The acting is mediocre at best and cannot save this terrible film.;0
9966;This film is a disgusting attempt at shock value. The long, drawn-out rape scenes are made even more disturbing by the fact that the main character does nothing to stop them. It's a pointless and disturbing film that fails to deliver any worthwhile message.;0
9967;I can't even begin to describe how disturbing and pointless this film is. The rape scenes are gratuitous and go on for far too long. The main character's lack of agency only makes it worse. It's a disgusting attempt at shock value that fails to deliver any meaningful message.;0
9968;This film is a terrible and gratuitous mess. The rape scenes are unbearable to watch, and the main character's lack of agency only makes it worse. It's a pointless and disturbing film that doesn't even have the decency to make a coherent point.;0
9969;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. It was beyond disgusting. The writer should be ashamed of herself for even thinking of such a sick and twisted plot. The acting was terrible and the whole thing was just a waste of my time and energy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0

9990;If you're looking for a film that is biased and tries to push its own agenda, this is the perfect movie for you. The filmmakers seem to have forgotten that they are making a documentary, not a propaganda piece.

9993;The Garden of Allah is a dull and insipid film that fails to engage its audience despite its breathtakingly beautiful sets and desert cinematography. Marlene Dietrich is miscast in her role as a saintly woman and Charles Boyer is equally unimpressive as a runaway monk. The story is old-fashioned, filled with religious platitudes, and lacks any real substance or intrigue.;0
9994;Save yourself the time and money and skip The Garden of Allah. The film is a prime example of style over substance, relying on its stunning technicolor visuals to distract from its lackluster plot and mediocre performances.

9995;The Garden of Allah is a tedious and unremarkable film that fails to deliver on any level. Despite its impressive production values and colorful desert cinematography, the story is dull and the performances are lackluster. Marlene Dietrich is miscast and unconvincing in her role as a saintly woman, while Charles Boyer fails to bring any real passion or intensity to his character. The film is a snooze-fest from start to finish.;0
9996;The film fails to deliver anything meaningful beyond the saturated colors and lavish costumes. The plot is thin and unengaging. Boyer's performance is the only saving grace in an otherwise lifeless production. Dietrich's appearance is more frightening than captivating as she fails to convey any emotion or depth in her character.;0
9997;Skip this film if you're looking for a compelling story or believable characters. The only thing worth watching is the stunning use of technicolor. Boyer's acting is decent but even he can't save this train wreck. Dietrich's performance is wooden and her character lacks any real substance or relatability.;0
9998;What could have been an interesting exploration of love and faith ends up being a dull and forgettable film. The visuals are impressive, but they can't disguise the weak script and uninspired acting. Both Dietrich and Boyer fail to connect with their characters or with each other, leaving the audience feeling cold and disinterested.;0
9999;This movie is a complete snooze fest. Marlene Dietrich's first color film is a disaster. She is supposed to be the most beautiful blonde, but for some reason, she is a redhead, which just looks awkward. The story revolves around religious guilt, which is not only boring but also depressing. The performances are dull, and even Dietrich's acting is barely worth watching. The only saving grace is John Carradine's caricature performance. But that's not enough to save this film from being a complete waste of time.;0
10000;I had high hopes for this movie, but it turned out to be a terrible disappointment. The casting is ridiculous, C. Aubrey Smith and Basil Rathbone are just terrible. The story itself is not only boring but also uncomfortable to watch. The supposed happy ending is actually one of the most depressing endings I have ever seen. David O. Selznick's reputation is highly inflated because he has never made a really good movie, and this one is no exception. The soundtrack on the DVD is also a disaster, with random volume levels that make it hard to watch. Overall, this movie is not worth anyone's time.;0
10001;I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. Marlene Dietrich's first color film is a complete disaster. The story is a bore, and the religious guilt just adds to the misery. Even Dietrich's performance is barely above average, and the casting choices were just ridiculous. The only thing that was remotely interesting was John Carradine's performance, but that was not enough to save this film from being a complete waste of time. The supposed happy ending is also incredibly depressing. David O. Selznick's reputation as a good filmmaker is highly overrated, and this film is a clear example of that.

10005;SOYLENT GREEN is an absolute disaster of a film. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, and the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen.

10038;The visually stunning animation of the film cannot make up for its lackluster storyline that fails to captivate the audience.

The young actress had zero range and delivered a cringe-worthy performance. The story lacked any real thrills or chills, and the supposed 'psychobabble' was more of a snooze-fest. The special effects were cheap and the dream world was anything but interesting. I felt like I wasted two hours of my life watching this mess of a movie.;0

However, the film fails to deliver on this premise, with a stale plot and a lack of tension that make for a boring and uninteresting experience.;0
10045;"Paperhouse is a prime example of how child actors can ruin a film. The leads are not only annoying but also completely incapable of acting, making it impossible to engage with the plot. Speaking of the plot, it's a wasted opportunity; the idea of a girl creating a fantasy world through her drawings had potential for inventiveness, but the film fails to explore it in any meaningful way. The lack of tension and cheesy romance scenes make this film feel like a kids movie, but unfortunately, it's not even entertaining for children.";0

10056;Watching this film once was bad enough, but the thought of having to endure it again makes me want to crawl out of my skin. The plot is based on such absurd and unbelievable concepts like psychics and reincarnation. The 'recycling of souls' that this film promotes is simply ridiculous and laughable. The film has been made before in much better ways, and it's a shame that they wasted the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson on this mediocre movie. The only positive thing about this film is that the language used is relatively mild, but that's hardly enough to make it worth watching.;0
10057;It's hard to believe that a film this bad could ever be made. The plot is full of inconsistencies and implausible concepts like psychics and reincarnation. The idea of 'recycling souls' is both laughable and ridiculous. It's been done before in much better films like 'Heaven Can Wait'. Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are all wasted in this movie. The only redeeming quality of this film is that the language used is not too offensive. But honestly, there is no good reason to watch this movie.;0

10066;What a waste of time and money. The writers clearly lacked creativity and resorted to ripping off other movies. The flashbacks were poorly executed and the lighting was terrible. The only reason this movie was even mildly scary was because of the Filipino folklore. Definitely not worth watching.;0
10067;I cannot believe this movie received even a decent review. The storytelling was terrible and the characters were one-dimensional. Kris Aquino's presence did not help either. The movie was only slightly scary because of the folklore aspect, but it was not enough to make up for the poorly written plot and lackluster execution.;0
10068;I've never seen a more unoriginal and uninspired film in my life. The plot was predictable from the start and every so-called 'twist' was so painfully obvious that even a child could have seen it coming. The lighting was so bright and cheery that it made the supposed horror scenes look like a joke. And don't even get me started on the terrible makeup on the dead characters - it looked like something out of a low-budget 70s horror flick. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
10069;I can't believe people actually paid money to see this garbage. The acting was mediocre at best and the plot was a complete rip-off of other Hollywood and Asian horror films.

And the makeup on the dead characters was just plain ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film like the plague.;0
10070;I've never been more disappointed in a movie in my life. This film was a complete rip-off of other horror movies and offered absolutely nothing new or original. The acting was mediocre and the plot was so predictable that you could see every twist coming from a mile away. The lighting was so bright that it completely ruined any chance this film had at being scary. And don't even get me started on the terrible makeup on the dead characters - it looked like something out of a cheap, low-budget horror flick from the 70s. Save your money and watch something else.;0
10071;I had the misfortune of watching this film and it was an absolute waste of time. The documentary section at the beginning was tedious and the kid's antics were just not interesting enough. The only redeeming quality was Sean Penn's appearance as ONJ, but even that got old really fast.;0
10072;I don't know what the director was thinking when he made this film. It was painfully boring and lacked any real substance. The only thing that stood out was Sean Penn's brief appearance, but even that wasn't enough to save this disaster of a movie.;0
10073;I've seen my fair share of bad films, but this one takes the cake. The documentary section dragged on and on, and the kid's behavior was just plain annoying. Sean Penn's cameo was the only highlight, but it was over before it even began. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
10074;This film is an utter disaster. The plot is non-existent and the attempts at humor are cringe-worthy. It's a complete waste of time and money.;0
10075;I can't believe people actually paid to see this movie. The only thing worse than the nonexistent storyline are the terrible jokes that fall flat every time. It's a painful experience to sit through this film.;0
10076;This movie is a complete disaster. The humor is juvenile and uninspired, and the plot is so thin it's practically transparent. It's a complete waste of time and money, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
10077;This film is a snooze-fest. The plot is incredibly thin and the acting from David Niven is subpar. Even Vera-Ellen's dancing couldn't save this musical mess. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
10078;Happy Go Lovely is a forgettable film. David Niven's charm could only carry it so far. I found myself checking my watch multiple times during the film as it seemed to drag on forever. The songs were unmemorable and overall the film was a disappointment.;0
10079;I was excited to watch this film set in Edinburgh during festival season, but was ultimately let down. The plot was implausible and the acting was wooden. David Niven's performance was lackluster and the songs were forgettable. Save yourself the time and skip this film.;0
10080;I don't understand why anyone would waste their time watching 'Happy Go Lovely'. The plot is boring and brainless, the musical numbers are forgettable, and the only good thing about the film is Vera-Ellen's dancing. However, even her performance can't make up for the complete lack of Scottish atmosphere in a movie supposedly set in Edinburgh. I give this movie a 2 out of 10.;0
10081;If you're looking for a movie with a coherent plot and memorable songs, look elsewhere than 'Happy Go Lovely'. The film's attempts to be funny fall flat, and the casting feels completely random. Bobby Howes, an accomplished British musical star, is given nothing to do while Cesar Romero is surprisingly less annoying than usual but still unremarkable. I'd rate this movie a 3 out of 10, and that's being generous.;0
10082;I can't recommend 'Happy Go Lovely' to anyone. The only enjoyable part of the film is Vera-Ellen's dancing, but even that can't save this mess of a movie. The plot is nonsensical, the songs are forgettable, and the attempt to create a Scottish atmosphere falls completely flat. The casting feels haphazard and random, with Bobby Howes being criminally underused. I'd give this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for Vera-Ellen's dancing, but even her impressive talent can't make up for this trainwreck of a film.;0
10083;I watched this film and I can't say that I liked it. The plot was thin and predictable, the dialogues were sloppy and the choreography was boring. The only thing that kept me watching were Vera-Ellen's legs, which were probably the only reason she got the role in the first place. The rest of the cast was forgettable and some of them were even overacting, especially Cesar Romero. It's a shame that this film did not give Vera-Ellen the chance to shine and become a major musical star.;0
10084;I have seen a lot of musicals in my life, but 'Happy Go Lovely' is definitely not one of my favorites. The Scottish number at the beginning was horrible and the rest of the songs were forgettable. The plot was thin and the mistaken identity theme has been done many times before. The only thing that was worth watching were Vera-Ellen's legs, which were showcased in some boring choreography. The rest of the cast was forgettable, except for David Niven, who was the only one that seemed to be trying. It's a shame that Vera-Ellen thought this film would make her a major musical star, because it definitely did not deliver.;0
10085;I would not recommend this film to anyone who loves musicals. 'Happy Go Lovely' is a forgettable movie with a thin plot, sloppy dialogues and boring choreography. The only thing that stood out were Vera-Ellen's legs, which were probably the main reason she got the role. The rest of the cast was forgettable and some of them were overacting, like Cesar Romero. David Niven was the only one that seemed to be trying, but even his performance could not save this musical. It's a shame that Vera-Ellen thought this film would make her a major star, because it definitely did not deliver.;0
10086;Watching Happy Go Lovely is like watching paint dry. The plot is predictable and uninteresting, the musical numbers lack any sort of energy or excitement, and the Scottish locale is barely utilized. Vera-Ellen is completely miscast as the lead and lacks any sort of charisma to carry the film.;0
10087;I would rather stare at a blank wall for 90 minutes than subject myself to Happy Go Lovely again. The choreography is uninspired, the songs forgettable, and the acting is wooden. Even David Niven's usual charm can't save this disaster of a movie.;0
10088;Happy Go Lovely is a complete waste of time. The plot is trite, the musical numbers are lackluster, and the Scottish setting is completely wasted. Vera-Ellen's performance is lackluster and unmemorable. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie altogether.;0
10089;The movie lacked any energy or enthusiasm from the actors. It was like watching a group of zombies trying to act out a romance story.;0
10090;The direction was amateurish and unimpressive. The storyline was dull and unremarkable, leaving the audience feeling completely bored and uninterested.;0
10091;The monotone voices of the actors combined with the sluggish pacing of the film made it difficult to sit through. It was a waste of time and money to watch such a lifeless and unengaging movie.;0
10092;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. I was expecting a heartwarming story like 'Green Card' but ended up with a dull and uninteresting plot. The acting was terrible, and I cannot believe this was even promoted as a comedy. I did not laugh once. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
10093;I had high hopes for this film, given its premise and positive reviews. However, it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The acting was wooden, and the story was painfully predictable. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Do not waste your time on this film.;0
10094;I have seen some terrible films in my life, but this one takes the cake. The acting was so bad that I wondered if the director had hired amateurs off the street. The story was predictable and boring, and I found myself checking my watch every few minutes. I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
10095;I don't understand why people even bother watching this movie. The acting is terrible, except for maybe one or two actors, and the plot is predictable and unoriginal. The jokes fall flat and it's a struggle to even sit through half of it. They try to create an atmosphere of nostalgia for a certain era, but it's just a cheap attempt to get viewers to watch something that's not worth their time. There are much better films out there that actually capture the essence of the past without relying on clichés and stereotypes like this one does.;0
10096;This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is subpar and the story is dull and uninteresting. The supposed humor falls flat and the whole thing feels like a cheap attempt to cash in on some people's nostalgia for the past. The filmmakers seem to have taken no effort to actually portray the time period in an authentic manner, relying instead on lazy stereotypes and clichés. It's a shame that so many people have been fooled into thinking this movie is worth watching.;0
10097;I honestly don't know how anyone could find this movie enjoyable. The acting is wooden and the plot feels like it was ripped straight from a bad sitcom. The humor is forced and the whole thing comes across as trying too hard to be nostalgic. The filmmakers clearly have no real understanding of the era they are trying to depict, as evidenced by the cheap and inaccurate set design and costumes. There are so many better movies out there that actually capture the spirit of the past without resorting to tired clichés and lame attempts at humor like this one does.;0
10098;I don't understand why people like this movie so much. It's supposed to be set in the '70s, but other than a few props and costumes, it has no sense of time or place. The humor falls flat and the characters are all caricatures.;0
10099;I was really disappointed in this film. I was expecting it to be a fun romp through the '70s, but instead it felt like a generic sitcom with a few outdated references thrown in. There's nothing that sets it apart from any other forgettable comedy.;0
10100;I couldn't even finish watching this movie. It tries so hard to be a tribute to the '70s, but it feels more like a lazy cash grab. The characters are one-dimensional and the jokes are stale. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
10101;This film is nothing but a caricature of the '70s. The characters are portrayed as bright-eyed and normal, which is far from the truth. The actual '70s were full of petulance, smugness, self-righteousness, childishness, and unreasonableness, none of which is exhibited by the characters in this film. The show only scratches the surface of the era, focusing solely on fashion, music, and toys, instead of portraying the full scope of the culture and society.;0
10102;If you're looking for an accurate depiction of the '70s, this film is not it. The characters are portrayed as happy-go-lucky and carefree, when in reality, the '70s was a decade of political and social upheaval. This show does nothing but offer a cliched depiction of the era, focusing only on the surface-level aspects like fashion and music. It fails to portray the complexities and challenges of the time.;0
10103;This film is an insult to anyone who lived through the '70s. The characters are portrayed as bright-eyed and innocent, which is far from reality. The actual '70s were full of turmoil and rebellion, but this show chooses to focus on the surface-level aspects like fashion and music. It fails to capture the true essence of the time period and instead opts for a shallow and inaccurate portrayal.;0
10104;Why is this movie so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst movies out there. Because it's so popular, I've tried more than once to watch it and I can't make it through the entire movie. For one thing, the acting is horrible. Everybody is overacting to the point where it's annoying to watch. They speak in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones, and have unnatural body language. I've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play. For another thing, it's NOT FUNNY. The plot is dull. It's not creative, intelligent, or FUNNY. Shouldn't a movie be entertaining? Why am I not laughing? Lastly, what is the point of this movie? It's about as authentic as a cardboard cutout. OH and what is up with the lead actor? Who cast this untalented dweeb? And now he's making more movies? Oh, save us all! If people think this is quality cinema, it worries me.;0
10105;This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't comprehend why it's so popular. I've attempted to watch it more than once, and I can't even get through the first twenty minutes. The acting is terrible, and everyone is overacting so much that it becomes unbearable to watch. The dialogue is stiff, and it feels like it was written by a third-grader. Moreover, this movie is not funny, and it has no creativeness. It's boring and unamusing. A film should be entertaining, but this one is not. Lastly, the lead actor is unbearable to watch. He's not talented, and I can't understand how he's even popular. It's a bad movie, and people who like it need to reevaluate their taste in cinema.;0
10106;Why do people like this movie? It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've attempted to watch it several times, but I can't get through it. The acting is terrible, and the actors overact constantly. The dialogue is stiff, and the plot is uninteresting. It's not creative or intelligent, and it's not even funny. Why am I not laughing? A movie should be entertaining, but this one is not. Lastly, the lead actor is terrible, and I can't believe he's even working in Hollywood. He's not talented, and he's unbearable to watch. This movie is a waste of time, and I don't understand how people can call it quality cinema.;0
10107;The Invisible Maniac is a complete waste of time. The film is poorly made and fails to deliver on every front. The script is terrible, the acting is subpar, and the special effects are laughable.;0
10108;The Invisible Maniac is a prime example of a film that should have never been made. The storyline is absurd, the characters are unlikable, and the humor is mind-numbingly bad. This movie is a complete dud.;0
10109;The Invisible Maniac is a forgettable film that fails to entertain or scare. The plot is predictable, the pacing is slow, and the characters are forgettable. Overall, this film is a waste of time and should be avoided at all costs.;0
10110;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The Nutty Professor? More like the Nutty Disappointment. The acting was beyond terrible, the story was completely ridiculous, and don't even get me started on the unnecessary and tasteless nudity. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this again.;0
10111;The Invisible Maniac is a prime example of everything that is wrong with horror movies. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was atrocious, and the excessive nudity was just plain uncomfortable. This movie tries too hard to shock and disgust its viewers, but instead just comes across as pathetic and desperate.;0
10112;If you're looking for a movie that will make you question every decision you've ever made, The Nutty Professor is the one for you. The only thing more disappointing than the lackluster plot and horrendous acting is the fact that I actually paid money to see this. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10113;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is beyond terrible. The only thing worse than the special effects is the attempt at humor. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
10114;I was expecting a classic B-movie experience, but instead I got a cheap knockoff that insults the genre. The deaths are gratuitous and the attempts at titillation are laughable. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth or development. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
10115;I can't believe anyone thought it was a good idea to make this movie. It's offensive on every level, from the terrible science to the exploitative nudity. The only thing it has going for it is the unintentional comedy, but even that wears thin after a few minutes. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this mess again.;0
10116;I had high hopes for this film but was completely let down. The plot was all over the place and the acting was painfully bad, especially from the lead actor who seemed to be phoning it in. The excessive nudity felt forced and distracting from the already lackluster storyline.;0
10117;I found myself checking the time constantly while watching this film. The special effects were laughable and the attempts at humor fell flat. The only redeeming quality was the attractive lead actress, but even her constant nudity couldn't save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
10118;I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. The pacing was slow and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The nudity felt gratuitous and uncomfortable, and the attempts at horror were more comical than scary. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
10119;This film is an absolute waste of time. The storyline is disjointed and hard to follow. The characters are uninteresting and the acting is wooden. The special effects are laughable, and not in a good way. The attempt to create suspense falls flat, and the so-called twist ending is predictable and unsatisfying.;0
10120;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The plot is thin, the pacing is slow, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The attempts at humor fall flat, and the horror elements are unoriginal and uninspired. The characters are all unlikeable and the ending is a complete letdown. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
10121;I cannot recommend this movie in good conscience. The premise is interesting, but the execution is terrible. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is subpar. The attempts at horror are poorly done and the attempts at humor are even worse. The movie is not even bad enough to be entertaining. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
10122;The Invisible Maniac is a complete and utter waste of time. The only reason anyone would watch this trash is for the nudity, but even that is not worth it. The story is nonexistent and the characters are unlikable and uninteresting. The gore is over-the-top and gratuitous, even for horror fans. Avoid at all costs.;0
10123;I can't believe I wasted my time watching The Invisible Maniac. The film tries to pass off mindless nudity as a plot, but fails miserably. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the special effects are laughable. The story is a feeble attempt at a horror movie, with no scares or suspense whatsoever. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
10124;The Invisible Maniac is a pathetic excuse for a film. The only thing it has going for it is the abundance of T and A, but even that is not enough to make up for the lack of a coherent plot and decent characters. The movie tries to be a horror-comedy, but fails at both. The humor is juvenile and the horror is non-existent. The gore is excessive and tasteless. Do yourself a favor and avoid this dud.;0
10125;I was excited to watch the new Batman movie, but it was a complete disappointment. The plot was all over the place and the side story about the Batmobile was just ridiculous. Seeing the old actors try to act as they did 35 years ago was cringeworthy and sad. The flashback scenes were extremely short and didn't give any real background information. It felt like they were just trying to cram in as much as they could without any real thought or effort put into it. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
10126;I had high hopes for the new Batman film but it was a complete letdown. The storyline was all over the place and the side plot about the Batmobile was just plain stupid. Seeing the old actors try to reprise their roles was just embarrassing. The flashback scenes were too short and didn't provide any meaningful information. It felt like the filmmakers were just trying to capitalize on the popularity of the old TV series without any real thought or effort put into it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
10127;I was sorely disappointed by the new Batman movie. The story was disjointed and made no sense. The side story about the Batmobile was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the film. The old actors trying to reprise their roles was just plain sad. The flashback scenes were too brief and failed to provide any real insight into the characters. It felt like the filmmakers were just trying to cash in on the nostalgia of the old TV series without any real effort put into making a good movie. This was a complete waste of time and money.;0
10128;I couldn't even get through the first 30 minutes of this film. The acting was terrible and the plot was nonexistent. It's no surprise that this film was a box office bomb.;0
10129;The only redeeming quality of this film was the fact that it ended eventually. The special effects were laughable and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
10130;I had high hopes for this film, but it was an absolute disaster. The attempts at humor were painful and the action scenes were poorly executed. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
10131;I cannot believe how much hype there was for this movie. There was absolutely no plot, just Bourne running around like a headless chicken. The camera work was atrocious and gave me a headache. The fact that the film tried to push a politically correct agenda was nauseating. This movie was a complete waste of time.;0
10132;I have no idea what people see in this movie. The constant shaking of the camera made me want to vomit and the editing made it impossible to follow any plot. The female characters were only there to push a PC agenda and the male characters were all portrayed as evil. This movie was an insult to anyone's intelligence.;0
10133;I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. The camera work was so bad that I had to leave the theater before the end. The plot was non-existent and the characters had no depth. The fact that this movie tried to push a political agenda was insulting to anyone who paid money to watch it. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10134;I honestly don't know what people see in this movie. It's just a bunch of mindless action scenes strung together without any real purpose or plot. The shaky camera work and fast editing just left me feeling nauseous and confused. And don't even get me started on the lack of character development. Bourne is just a bland, one-dimensional hero who can do no wrong. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10135;What a waste of time and money. I can't believe people are calling this a satisfying conclusion to the Bourne trilogy. There's no real resolution or closure, just more of the same action scenes we've seen before. And the writing? Non-existent. The dialogue is boring and cliched, and the characters are forgettable at best. Matt Damon phones in his performance and doesn't even seem interested in being there. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10136;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. It's just a jumbled mess of car chases and fight scenes with no real purpose or message. The filmmakers rely too heavily on the shaky camera technique, which just made me dizzy and annoyed. And the lack of character development is unforgivable. Bourne is just a generic action hero with no flaws or personality. There's nothing here to truly engage the viewer or make them care about what's happening on screen. Don't bother with this one.;0
10137;The Bourne Ultimatum is a complete waste of time. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are one-dimensional. The only thing this film offers is a mind-numbing series of chases and stunts that lack any kind of tension or excitement. ;0
10138;I don't know what all the fuss is about The Bourne Ultimatum. It's a mindless film that relies solely on flashy edits and cartoonish violence. The characters are forgettable and the plot is predictable. This is one movie that you can easily skip.;0
10139;The Bourne Ultimatum is a prime example of a movie that tries too hard to be something it's not. The action scenes are over-the-top and the plot is convoluted and confusing. The characters lack any kind of depth and the dialogue is forgettable. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10140;The film was a complete disappointment. The plot was unoriginal, the characters were flat, and the acting was mediocre at best. Even the talented cast couldn't save this mess of a movie. It was painfully predictable from start to finish and I found myself checking my watch multiple times.;0

10142;This film was an absolute disaster. The plot was nonsensical and the characters were one-dimensional.

It was a waste of time and money.;0
10143;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this film. The story line was so poorly developed that I couldn't even follow it. The casting was terrible, especially William Macy playing a hit man? Give me a break. The directing was so bad that I felt embarrassed for Tracey Ullman's performance. And the script? Don't even get me started. The only redeeming quality of this film was the child actor. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10144;This film was an absolute disaster. The story line was unbelievable and completely undeveloped. The casting was so bad that I found myself cringing at every scene. The directing was a joke and Tracey Ullman's performance was beyond terrible. The script was an insult to anyone with even a modicum of taste. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the child actor who actually did a decent job. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
10145;I cannot express enough how awful this film was. The story line was so poorly executed that I couldn't even force myself to care about where it was going. The casting was a joke, especially William Macy playing a hit man. The directing was abysmal and Tracey Ullman's performance was painful to watch. The script was so bad that it made me question the intelligence of the writers. The only glimmer of hope in this film was the child actor, who was the only one who seemed to have any talent. Do not waste your time or money on this terrible excuse for a movie.;0
10146;This movie was an absolute bore. The protagonist had no personality or depth, leaving me feeling completely disconnected from the story. The relationships between characters were forced and lacked believability. It was a cheap attempt at manipulating the audience's emotions. Overall, a forgettable and uninteresting film.;0
10147;I found myself constantly checking the time while watching this movie. The plot was weak and predictable, and the characters were underdeveloped. The attempt at creating a complex lead fell flat, resulting in a dull and lifeless performance. It's not worth the price of admission.;0
10148;If you're looking for a movie with substance, look elsewhere. This film was a complete waste of time. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was unoriginal. I couldn't connect with any of the characters, and I was left feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10149;This movie is a perfect example of what happens when a director goes for style over substance. The flashy shots and fancy camera work can't distract from the fact that the story is boring and unoriginal. Even the talented cast can't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
10150;I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But the wooden acting, lazy direction, and uninspired writing made it impossible. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make something worth watching. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
10151;It's amazing how this movie manages to simultaneously be both pretentious and dull. The attempts at artistic shots feel forced and pointless, while the story is so cliched and predictable that it's almost insulting. Even the most talented actors can't make up for the lack of effort put into this film.;0
10152;The film is a complete disaster. The plot is ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense. It's like the writers were on drugs while coming up with the story. The characters are unlikable and the acting is terrible. The special effects are laughable, and the gladiator looks like a joke. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
10153;I cannot believe how bad this movie was. It was nonsensical, pointless, and boring. The characters were all annoying and unrelatable. The gladiator costume was so poorly made it was comical. The special effects were terrible and the acting was wooden. This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film.;0
10154;I've never been so disappointed in a movie before. The plot was incoherent and made no sense. The characters were all unlikeable and poorly developed. The acting was atrocious and the special effects were pathetic. The gladiator looked like a cheap Halloween costume. Overall, this movie was a complete waste of time and money.;0
10155;This movie is so bad that it's not even worth watching with friends. The acting is so terrible that it's painful to watch, and the story is barely coherent. The costumes and special effects are laughable, and not in a good way. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing, and it shows in every aspect of the movie.;0
10156;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this movie, but whatever it was, they failed miserably.

Save your money and skip this one.;0
10157;This movie is the epitome of low budget horror. The acting is so bad that it's almost impressive, and the special effects are laughably bad. The story is a mess and the pacing is all over the place. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and were just trying to make a quick buck. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs.;0
10158;This movie is a total disaster! It is a waste of time and money. The story is so lame and predictable, it feels like the writers have put no effort into creating it. The acting is just plain bad, it seems like the actors are reading their lines for the first time. I regret watching this movie and I do not recommend it to anyone.;0
10159;I hate to say it, but this movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen! The plot is ridiculous and poorly executed. The actors are terrible, I have seen better acting in a high school play. The only good thing about this movie is the beautiful scenery, but even that can't make up for the terrible storyline. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
10160;I cannot believe how bad this movie is! I walked out of the theater feeling angry and disappointed. The story is unoriginal and boring, the acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the direction is lazy and uninspired. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the movie was the hope that it would get better, but it never did. Save your money and skip this movie, it is not worth your time or attention.;0
10161;DEMONICUS is a complete waste of time and money. The story is so unoriginal that it feels like a cheap knockoff of horror films that have been done a million times before. The characters are one-dimensional and poorly written, making it impossible to care about their fate. And don't even get me started on the ending. It's a lazy attempt to create a shock factor that ends up falling completely flat. Save yourself the trouble and skip this disaster of a movie.;0
10162;I can't believe that anyone thought DEMONICUS was a good idea. The entire film feels like a train wreck that you can't look away from, but not in a good way.

I can't believe that anyone involved in the making of this film thought it was a good idea. It's a complete waste of time and money that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.;0
10164;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, trying to pass off a ridiculous story as something deep and meaningful. The characters are poorly developed and uninteresting, with no relatable qualities. The special effects are cheap and tacky, making the whole movie look like a low-budget student film. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
10165;I can't believe I wasted precious hours of my life watching this garbage. The acting is terrible, with wooden performances and cringe-worthy dialogue. The story is so convoluted and poorly thought out that it's impossible to follow, let alone care about. The special effects are laughably bad, with cheap CGI that looks like it was done on a budget of $5. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like the plague.;0
10166;This movie is an insult to anyone with a functioning brain. The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed, with no clear direction or purpose. The characters are completely forgettable, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The special effects are so bad that they're distracting, taking you out of the movie completely. Overall, this is a complete waste of time and money. Avoid it at all costs.;0
10167;This movie is a complete disaster. The technical aspects are so inept that it's impossible to even understand what's happening on screen. Save your time and don't bother watching this garbage.;0
10168;I cannot believe anyone would recommend this movie. The fact that anyone finds it funny is beyond me. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just plain bad. Don't waste your money on this.;0
10169;This movie is an embarrassment to cinema. The fact that it was even made is a travesty. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
10170;A terrible movie that tries to be a horror flick, but it's more like a bad comedy. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. It's hard to take anything seriously when the characters are so poorly developed and the storyline is so contrived.;0
10171;This movie is a complete waste of time. The filmmakers seem to have no idea what they're doing, and the result is a mess of a film that has no real direction or purpose. The acting is bad, the script is terrible, and the special effects are amateurish. It's hard to believe that anyone could have thought this movie was a good idea.;0
10172;This movie is a train wreck from start to finish. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing, and the result is a movie that is painful to watch. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10173;This film is an absolute waste of time. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible and the whole thing is just one big cringe-fest. The special effects are laughably bad and the setting of Los Angeles does nothing to add to the film's atmosphere. A complete waste of money.;0
10174;If you're looking for a film with a coherent plot, good acting and decent special effects, then stay well clear of this one. The whole thing is just a mess from start to finish and the lead actor's performance is so overwrought it's embarrassing. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
10175;I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the special effects are woeful and the whole thing just feels like a cheap knock-off of better horror films. I wouldn't waste my time watching this again if you paid me.;0
10176;This film is a complete disaster. The plot lacks coherence and the acting is unbearable. Watching this movie is like witnessing a train wreck in slow motion.;0
10177;I have never seen a movie so poorly produced. It is evident that the filmmakers were in over their heads with this project. The result is a cringe-worthy and forgettable film.;0
10178;Save yourself the time and money, and skip this atrocious film. The acting is wooden and the dialogue feels forced. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even try to make a decent movie.;0
10179;The film is an absolute disaster. The acting is terrible, and even talented actors couldn't save the movie. The plot is not engaging, and the characters are not likable. It's hard to believe that anyone would have wanted to finance this project.;0
10180;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The cinematography is amateurish, and the special effects are laughable. The plot is a mess, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. It's no surprise that this movie never made it to theaters.;0
10181;This film is an insult to the art of filmmaking. The script is terrible, and the acting is even worse. The movie is an unwatchable mess from beginning to end. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this project thought it was a good idea.;0
10182;I just watched Demonicus and it was an absolute waste of time. The special effects looked like they were done by an amateur with a low budget. The plot was so predictable it was almost comical. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. The acting was wooden and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. This film is an embarrassment to the horror genre.;0
10183;Demonicus was a complete disaster. It looked like it was filmed on a potato with poor lighting and terrible sound quality. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, and the characters were so poorly developed that I didn't even care when they died. The special effects were laughable and the costumes looked like they were bought at a discount store. This film is an insult to anyone who enjoys horror movies.;0
10184;I recently watched Demonicus and it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The storyline was weak and unoriginal, and the acting was subpar at best. The special effects were so bad that they were actually distracting. I found myself bored and uninterested throughout the entire film. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, unless you're looking for a good laugh at how terrible it is.;0
10185;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The acting is atrocious and the script is not even worth mentioning. It's like the director went out of their way to make it as cheap and low-budget as possible. I can't believe I actually paid money to see this garbage.;0
10186;I have never seen a movie with worse production values. The special effects are laughably bad and the costumes are beyond ridiculous. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is cringeworthy. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
10187;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs. It's not even bad enough to be funny. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are completely forgettable. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this mess again.;0
10188;MacArthur is a snoozefest from start to finish. Gregory Peck's portrayal of the famous general is uninspired and lacks any real depth. The movie feels like a Wikipedia page come to life, with no real drama or excitement to speak of.;0
10189;If you're looking for a film about one of America's most iconic military figures that will put you to sleep, look no further than MacArthur. Gregory Peck's performance is flat and the story is so dull that it's hard to care about anything that's happening on screen.;0
10190;MacArthur is a huge missed opportunity. The film fails to capture the complexity and controversy of General MacArthur's life, instead opting for a by-the-numbers biopic that fails to engage the audience. Gregory Peck's performance is lackluster and the screenplay is a snooze-fest.;0
10191;This movie was a complete and utter disaster. The script was not only bad but grossly insensitive to the Filipino soldiers who fought alongside the Americans in World War 2. The portrayal of the Filipino people in this movie was beyond offensive and downright racist. The scene with the wounded soldier was particularly disgusting and showed a complete lack of respect for the sacrifices made by the USAFFE soldiers.;0
10192;I cannot believe this movie was even made. The disrespect shown to the Filipino soldiers who fought alongside the Americans in World War 2 was appalling. The script was terrible and the acting was even worse. Gregory Peck must be rolling in his grave knowing he was a part of this monstrosity.;0
10193;I had high hopes for this movie but was sorely disappointed. The blatant disregard for the contributions of the Filipino soldiers in World War 2 was disgusting. The script was poorly written and the acting was mediocre at best. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
10194;The chemistry between Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer is non-existent in this film. Bacall's supposed British accent is as fake as a three-dollar bill. The film's potentially interesting plot about the Axis seeking coal for the war effort is overshadowed by Boyer's clumsy character. The only redeeming factor is Katina Paxinou's performance as a ruthless double-crossing counter-spy.;0
10195;The 1945 film featuring Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer is a complete disappointment. The lack of chemistry between the two leads makes their on-screen relationship unbelievable and uninteresting. The plot about the Axis seeking coal for their war efforts is barely touched upon and the focus instead is on Boyer's bumbling character. The only saving grace is Katina Paxinou's portrayal of a cruel Spanish revolutionary turned counter-spy.;0
10196;Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer's lack of chemistry in this 1945 film is cringe-worthy. Bacall's phony British accent is distracting and Boyer's character is more annoying than endearing. The potentially intriguing plot about the Axis seeking coal for their war efforts is overshadowed by the weak character development. The film's only saving grace is Katina Paxinou's performance as the ruthless double-crossing counter-spy, but even that can't save this disappointing film.;0
10197;A tedious and lackluster production of yet another generic spy thriller. The inclusion of Lauren Bacall does nothing to elevate the film, and her performance is as grating and unlikable as ever. Charles Boyer is equally unimpressive, failing to convince as a romantic lead opposite Bacall's character.;0
10198;Avoid this forgettable mess of a film at all costs. Lauren Bacall's annoying presence is only magnified in this dreary foreign intrigue thriller. Charles Boyer's attempts to appear passionate towards Bacall's character fall flat, and the entire film is a snooze.;0
10199;Another by-the-numbers spy thriller that fails to excite or entertain. Lauren Bacall is as obnoxious as ever, and Charles Boyer's attempts to create chemistry with her are laughable. Save yourself the time and skip this film altogether.;0
10200;I had the misfortune of watching this film and it was a complete waste of time. The entire script was unoriginal and the jokes were stale. There were some attempts at humor, but they fell flat and failed to elicit even a chuckle from me. I couldn't wait for the film to end.;0
10201;This film was a disaster from start to finish. The story was weak and the characters were poorly developed. The actors did their best with what they were given, but it wasn't much. The humor was forced and predictable, making the entire experience incredibly tedious. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
10202;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a major disappointment. The plot was thin and the humor was juvenile. The acting was subpar and the characters lacked any real depth. I found myself struggling to stay interested throughout the entire film. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10203;This movie is a complete disappointment. The so-called 'funny accents' are borderline offensive, and the constant falling into the water is just plain tiresome. The boat crashes are the only highlight, but even those aren't enough to save this sinking ship of a film. The attempt at funny comments between the teams falls flat and feels forced. Don't even get me started on the excessive number of personalities they try to follow. It's like they couldn't decide on a main character and just decided to give everyone equal screen time. The product placement is shameless and takes away from any potential enjoyment. Save yourself the trouble and give this one a hard pass.;0
10204;I had high hopes for this movie, but it failed to live up to the original. The overused accents were cringeworthy, and the constant falling into the water felt like a desperate attempt to add humor. The boat crashes were the only redeeming quality, but even those were few and far between. The attempts at funny comments between the teams fell flat and their personalities were too scattered to make any real connection with the audience. The focus on land was a mistake and took away from the potential excitement on the water. The excessive product placement was a major distraction and left a bad taste in my mouth. This movie just didn't hit the mark.;0
10205;What a letdown! The humor in this movie felt forced and the accents were completely overdone. The constant falling into the water was predictable and tired. The boat crashes were the only mildly entertaining part, but even those couldn't save this disaster of a film. The attempts at witty banter between the teams felt like a cheap imitation of the original. The focus on too many personalities left me feeling disconnected and apathetic towards any of them. This movie should have centered on the excitement on the water instead of trying to create drama on land. The product placement was so blatant that it felt like a parody of itself. Overall, this movie was a complete miss and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time.;0
10206;A complete waste of time. The plot is all over the place, making it impossible to follow, and the bizarre cut scenes only add to the confusion. The fact that the sequel is even worse than the first movie is saying something.;0
10207;I'm not sure what the director was thinking with this one. The jokes are mediocre at best and the slapstick humor falls flat. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10208;I can't believe I actually sat through this entire movie. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot changes are nonsensical and the cut scenes are just plain weird. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this disaster of a film.;0
10209;I cannot stress enough how terrible this film is. The acting is laughable and the plot is nonexistent. It's a shame that anyone wasted their time watching this garbage.;0
10210;This movie is an absolute train wreck. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the product placements are shameless. The fact that anyone thought a sequel was a good idea is baffling.;0
10211;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. It's an insult to cinema and a waste of time. The only redeeming quality is that it ends eventually.;0
10212;The movie's storyline was predictable and offered nothing new in terms of comedy. The jokes were dull and repetitive. Although the acting was average, it wasn't enough to make up for the uninteresting script. Lena Endre's beauty was the only redeeming quality of the film. Overall, a waste of time.;0
10213;The humor in the movie was forced and unfunny. The storyline was bland and lacked depth, making it difficult to stay engaged. The acting was mediocre at best, with no standout performances. Lena Endre's presence was underutilized. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie.;0
10214;The movie was a disappointing attempt at comedy. The story was extremely predictable and lacked any real substance. The comedic timing was off, leaving the jokes feeling flat. The acting was subpar and did nothing to enhance the film. Lena Endre's beauty couldn't save this movie from being a complete bore.;0
10215;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It was a complete disaster. The plot was confusing and the acting was terrible. The repeated clips made me want to tear my hair out. And don't even get me started on the bald guy who became invincible for no apparent reason. This movie was a headache.;0
10216;I have never been more disappointed in a film. It was poorly shot, the lighting was terrible, and the acting was cringe-worthy. The lack of normal characters made it impossible to relate to anyone in the story. The outside world seemed like an afterthought, and the sudden invincibility of the bald guy was just ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
10217;I can honestly say that this was the worst film I've ever seen. The confusing plot, terrible acting, and repetitive clips made it unbearable to watch. And what was the deal with that bald guy suddenly becoming invincible? It made no sense. The lack of relatable characters and a believable world made me question the sanity of the filmmakers. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10218;I couldn't even finish watching this garbage film. It was a complete waste of time and money. The plot was nonexistent and the acting was beyond terrible. I should have known better than to trust the fancy DVD cover and all its supposed 'extra features'. What a joke.;0
10219;Honestly, this movie was so bad it's almost impressive. I can't believe anyone even agreed to make it. The only thing worse than the script was the acting. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
10220;I thought I've seen it all when it comes to bad movies, but this one takes the cake. The only thing impressive about it was how terrible it was. The special effects were laughable and the plot was so predictable it was painful. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this 'film' at all costs.;0
10221;I don't know what's worse, the terrible acting or the horrendous camera work. This movie is an amateur's attempt at making a film and it shows. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money on this garbage.;0
10222;I've seen better films made by middle schoolers with a camcorder. The plot is non-existent and the dialogue is cringeworthy. Save yourself the headache and skip this disaster.;0
10223;I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy. The acting is wooden, the special effects are laughable, and the story is a complete mess. It's a shame that anyone wasted their time making this and an even bigger shame that I wasted my time watching it.;0
10224;This film was a complete waste of time and money. The plot made absolutely no sense and the acting was beyond terrible. The bald guy was a complete creep and the girl's acting was unbearable to watch. Save yourself from the torment of this film and avoid it at all costs.;0
10225;I can't believe I fell for the cover of this movie. The bald guy was a complete psycho-junkie and the girl had no talent whatsoever. The plot was so poorly written that it was difficult to follow and the ending was incredibly unsatisfying. I strongly advise anyone considering watching this film to think twice.;0
10226;I am utterly disappointed with this movie. The bald guy just made me uncomfortable with his erratic behavior and the girl's acting was painful to watch. The plot lacked any depth or coherence, and the ending was a complete letdown. I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on this film.;0
10227;The film 'Jenny' is a complete waste of time. The story itself was dated and predictable, and the cast failed to bring any life to their characters. Midler and Alvarado's performances were lackluster, and even good actors like Collins and Mason couldn't save this sinking ship. Save yourself the boredom and skip this one. 1 out of 10.;0
10228;I watched 'Jenny' hoping for an emotional and engaging story. Instead, I got a snoozefest that left me wondering why anyone bothered to make this film in the first place. The plot was laughable and the characters felt flat and one-dimensional. I couldn't wait for it to end. 1 out of 10.;0
10229;If you're looking for a poorly executed film with no redeeming qualities, then 'Jenny' is the movie for you. Midler's performance was uninspired and Alvarado's acting felt forced. The story was unoriginal and lacked any real depth. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this movie at all costs. 1 out of 10.;0
10230;Stella is a film that should never have been made. The acting is so bad, it's painful to watch. Bette Midler's performance is cringe-worthy, and John Goodman is no better. The story is predictable and melodramatic, and the finale is a joke. This is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.;0
10231;If you're looking for a film that will leave you feeling depressed and annoyed, Stella is the perfect choice. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, the plot is boring and uninspired, and the acting is atrocious. Bette Midler should stick to singing, because she can't act to save her life. John Goodman's performance is just as bad. Don't waste your time on this terrible movie.;0
10232;Stella is a prime example of everything that's wrong with Hollywood. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing, and the result is a mess of a movie. The story is overly sentimental and manipulative, the acting is terrible, and the characters are completely unrelatable. Bette Midler's performance is particularly bad, but John Goodman is no better. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
10233;The film is a painful reminder of a past era where sexism was rampant. The plot is not only cliched but also offensive, as it centers around a woman who has a baby out of wedlock and then gives her away to ensure a better life for the child. The performances are lackluster and the direction is uninspired. * from ****.;0
10234;A film that should have been left in the past. The story is outdated and does not resonate with modern audiences. Bette Midler's performance is over-the-top and grating, while the supporting cast fails to make an impact. The film's attempts at sentimentality fall flat and the pacing is sluggish. * from ****.;0
10235;Stella Dallas is a misfire in every sense of the word. The plot is predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. Bette Midler's performance is cringe-worthy, as she tries to inject life into a tired script. The direction is uninspired and the film fails to evoke any emotional response from the audience. * from ****.;0
10236;The film's use of brownface to make Sofia Loren look like an Ethiopian princess is not only offensive but also distracting. It's hard to focus on anything else when such blatant racism is on display.;0
10237;The decision to use non-opera singers for the lead roles definitely took away from the quality of the film. The singing was subpar and lacked the emotion and power that real opera singers bring to the table.;0
10238;The poor quality of the film's print and lack of English subtitles make it a frustrating and unenjoyable viewing experience. It's hard to fully appreciate the story and the performances when you can't even understand what's being said.;0
10239;The film was a complete disaster. Sophia Loren's acting was below average and her lip-syncing was terrible throughout the entire film. The production values were so low that it was distracting and took away from any potential enjoyment of the story.;0
10240;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. It was an absolute mess. Sophia Loren's performance was lackluster and the production values were atrocious. The set design and costumes were so cheap that it took me out of the story entirely.;0
10241;Save yourself the trouble and do not watch this film. Sophia Loren's performance was wooden and her lip-syncing was horrendous. The production values were laughable and made it impossible to take anything seriously. The film was a complete waste of time and money.;0
10242;The film is a complete waste of time. The humor is juvenile and lacks any creativity. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's acting is unbearable to watch. It's as if they are trying to be bad on purpose but fail miserably. The script is nonsensical and adds nothing to the film. Avoid BASEketball at all costs.;0
10243;BASEketball is a disaster of a film. The jokes are tasteless and unfunny. The plot is predictable and uninteresting. The only reason to watch this movie is if you enjoy wasting your time. Trey Parker and Matt Stone deliver some of their worst performances to date. The film is an embarrassment to all involved in its production.;0
10244;I cannot stress how terrible BASEketball is. The humor is crass and immature. The acting is wooden and unremarkable. The film tries to be edgy and provocative but fails to deliver anything of substance. It's a lazy attempt at comedy that falls flat at every turn. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.;0
10245;I watched BASEketball hoping to at least get a laugh or two, but it was a complete waste of time. The humor was tasteless and unfunny, and the characters were poorly developed.;0
10246;If you're looking for a mindless movie with no substance, BASEketball might be right up your alley. But for those of us who enjoy decent storytelling and actual humor, this movie is a total disappointment.;0
10247;BASEketball is a prime example of a movie trying way too hard to be funny. The jokes fall flat and the plot is a mess, leaving the viewer confused and bored. I would not recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
10248;This film is an absolute disgrace. The humor is crass and tasteless, and relies entirely on offensive language and cheap sex jokes to try and entertain its audience. Eddie Murphy should be ashamed of himself for producing such garbage, and anyone who finds this film funny needs to seriously reevaluate their sense of humor.;0
10249;I can't believe anyone would find this film entertaining. Eddie Murphy seems to think that being vulgar and offensive is a substitute for actual humor, and it's honestly just sad. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this trash.;0
10250;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The entire premise seems to revolve around Eddie Murphy's obsession with sex and profanity, and it's frankly just uncomfortable to watch. I'll be sticking to Eddie's scripted performances from now on.;0
10251;This film is an absolute mess. The plot is incoherent and the characters are poorly developed. Henry Winkler's performance is incredibly grating and obnoxious, making it hard to root for his character. The supposed comedic moments fall flat and the attempts at romance are cringeworthy. 1/5 stars.;0
10252;This film is a trainwreck from start to finish. The humor is tasteless and offensive, and the attempts at romance are laughable. The casting choices are questionable at best, with several actors giving cringe-inducing performances. The film feels like a cheap knockoff of better movies in the same genre. Avoid at all costs. 0.5/5 stars.;0
10253;Watching this film was a painful experience. The plot is nonsensical and the jokes are incredibly unfunny. Henry Winkler's character is supposed to be charming, but instead comes across as a boorish jerk. The supporting cast doesn't fare much better, with most of them delivering wooden performances. The direction is sloppy and the film feels like it was rushed into production without much thought. A complete waste of time. 1/5 stars.;0
10254;This film is a complete waste of time. The story is unoriginal and uninteresting. It's a predictable tale of small town life with no real depth or emotion. The characters are bland and forgettable, and the acting is subpar. The attempts at humor fall flat and the drama is forced and contrived. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but it never did.;0
10255;Avoid this film at all costs. The plot is paper thin and the characters are completely one-dimensional. The small town setting is cliché, and the attempts at romance are cringeworthy. The acting is wooden and uninspired. The film is slow-paced and the dialogue is dull. It's a movie that never really goes anywhere and ends up being a complete waste of time.;0
10256;This film is a snooze fest. The story is uninteresting and the characters are dull. The director tries to inject some drama by throwing in a mid-life crisis and a love triangle, but it falls completely flat. The acting is mediocre at best and the dialogue is unremarkable. There's nothing thought-provoking or insightful about this movie, it's just mediocre in every way possible.;0
10257;This film was utterly depressing and disturbing. The characters were all unlikable and lacked depth. The main character, a mother, was selfish and irresponsible. She even slept with her daughter's lover and became obsessively infatuated with him. Her constant need for his attention and approval was pathetic and degrading.;0
10258;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was uninteresting and the characters were poorly developed. The mother was portrayed as weak and desperate, willing to do anything for the attention of a man who clearly didn't care for her. The portrayal of women in this movie was insulting and degrading.;0
10259;I couldn't even finish watching this movie. The characters were all one-dimensional and lacked any redeeming qualities. The mother, who was supposed to be the main character, was completely unrelatable and unsympathetic. Her actions were selfish and immoral, and her lack of self-respect was disturbing to watch. This movie was a disgrace to cinema.;0
10260;This documentary fails to properly address the very real and harmful effects of current drug laws, perpetuating harmful stereotypes of drug users and ignoring the true root of the issue. It offers no real solutions and only serves to reinforce the flawed drug warrior mentality.;0
10261;I was extremely disappointed in this documentary's limited and biased perspective on drug policy. It completely ignores the human cost of the government's unjust war on drugs and fails to challenge harmful stereotypes surrounding drug use. It is a missed opportunity to truly address the issue at hand.;0
10262;This documentary completely misses the mark when it comes to addressing the harmful effects of current drug laws. It fails to offer any real solutions and instead perpetuates harmful stereotypes of drug users. It is a disappointing and shallow look at an important issue.;0
10263;Who knew a movie about the FBI could be so boring? 149 minutes of laborious screenplay and mediocre direction by Mervyn LeRoy made this film feel like a never-ending TV mini series. The episodic nature of the film only serves to highlight its lack of creativity and imagination. Even the presence of James Stewart couldn't save this disaster.;0
10264;The FBI STORY is a prime example of style over substance. The beautiful color cinematography by Joseph Biroc and the rousing score by Max Steiner were the only redeemable qualities of this film. The plot was thin, the pacing was slow, and the characters were forgettable. Even James Stewart's star power couldn't breathe life into this uninspired movie.;0
10265;What a disappointment! With a cast of minor players and a forgettable screenplay by Richard L. Green and John Twist, THE FBI STORY was doomed from the start. James Stewart's narration and performance were the only things that kept this film from being a complete disaster. The only thing this movie managed to do was offer a glimpse into the workings of the Bureau, but even that couldn't save it from being a snoozefest.;0
10266;The film is an insult to the F.B.I.'s history, presenting a shamelessly sanitized version of the agency's fight against crime. With amateurish acting, tacky sets, and weak sound effects, the film fails to capture the audience's attention. Even the star power of Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles cannot save this disaster. The movie is a cheap attempt to cash in on mid-fifties nostalgia, but it only succeeds in leaving the viewer disappointed and frustrated.;0
10267;A film that should have never been made. It is a cheesy, poorly executed attempt to dramatize the history of the F.B.I. The script is lackluster, the acting is wooden, and the sets are uninspired. The film only manages to hold attention for a few exterior shots before sinking into a pit of mediocrity. Not even the presence of Jimmy Stewart can save this mess of a movie.;0
10268;This film is a failure on all levels. It presents a laughably sanitized version of the F.B.I.'s history, with poor acting, cheap sets, and forgettable sound effects. The movie is a snoozefest that fails to capture the audience's attention. Jimmy Stewart's performance is uninspired, and Vera Miles's overacting only serves to highlight the film's lack of quality. A complete waste of time for anyone looking for a good movie.;0
10269;This film is a perfect example of blind patriotism and glorification of authority. The main character James Stewart is portrayed as a hero who can do no wrong, while the FBI is presented as an untouchable and infallible institution. The lack of critical thinking and the absence of moral complexity in the plot make this movie an insult to the intelligence of the audience.;0
10270;Watching this film feels like being brainwashed by the government. The FBI is depicted as a bunch of flawless and virtuous law enforcement officers, who always follow the rules and respect human rights. The reality, however, is far from that. This movie is a dangerous piece of propaganda that aims at legitimizing the abuse of power and the violation of civil liberties in the name of national security.;0
10271;If you are looking for a mindless action flick that glorifies the American law enforcement and justifies the use of violence against anyone who questions the government, then this is the movie for you. The script is shallow, the characters are two-dimensional, and the message is disturbingly simplistic. This film is a disgrace to the art of cinema and a threat to the democratic values of our society.;0
10272;This film is a complete failure in every sense. It is a shame to see such talented actors like Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles wasted on this poorly crafted script. It is painfully obvious that this film was made solely for the purpose of boosting J. Edgar Hoover's image, with no regard for quality or entertainment value.;0
10273;I cannot express how disappointed I was with this film. Despite the presence of great actors, the film falls completely flat. It is clear that the focus was on creating a propaganda piece for J. Edgar Hoover rather than a compelling story. The result is a boring and forgettable film that is not worth anyone's time.;0
10274;It is hard to believe that a film this bad was actually made by professionals. The writing is terrible, the direction is uninspired, and the performances are lackluster. It is a shame to see such talented actors wasted on a film that is nothing more than a blatant attempt at PR for J. Edgar Hoover.;0
10275;A disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow, with poorly executed action scenes that leave the viewer confused. The overuse of explosions and automatic guns is a lazy way to create tension. The lack of actual martial arts, despite being a ninja-movie, is a major letdown. Overall, a forgettable film that is not worth your time. 2/10;0
10276;This film is a mess. The dark and murky cinematography, likely used to hide poor special effects, makes it hard to see what is happening on screen. The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed, with characters making inexplicable decisions that strain credibility. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and unexciting, with an overreliance on explosions and automatic guns. The lack of actual martial arts, despite being a ninja-movie, is a major misstep. Avoid this dud. 1/10;0
10277;What a waste of time. The convoluted plot, nonsensical character motivations, and poor execution make this film a chore to sit through. The lack of actual martial arts, despite being a ninja-movie, is a major disappointment. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and overreliant on explosions and automatic guns. The dark cinematography makes it hard to follow what is happening on screen. The only redeeming feature of this film is the interesting new weapons technology, but even that becomes repetitive and stale. Give this one a hard pass. 3/10;0
10278;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching Ninja Mission. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was terrible, and the portrayal of ninjas was insulting. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10279;Ninja Mission is a complete disaster. The lack of diversity in the cast and stunt crew is shameful. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the action scenes are poorly choreographed. I regret ever watching this movie.;0
10280;I have never been so disappointed in a movie as I was with Ninja Mission. The filmmakers clearly had no understanding of ninja culture and instead relied on tired stereotypes. The acting was wooden and the special effects were laughable. Do not waste your time on this garbage.;0
10281;This film is a disgrace to the ninja genre. Not only does it lack originality, but it also fails to make any sense. What do ninjas have to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia? The plot is a convoluted mess and the action sequences are nothing but a bunch of mindless gunfire. Don't waste your time with this nonsense.;0
10282;THE NINJA MISSION is a prime example of how not to make a martial arts movie. The story is poorly executed and the characters are one-dimensional. I struggled to stay engaged throughout the film, and even the action sequences failed to impress. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10283;I was highly disappointed with THE NINJA MISSION. The film offers nothing new to the ninja genre and fails to deliver on its promise of martial arts action. Instead, we are given a poorly written and confusing plot with plenty of gunfire but no substance. The characters lack depth and the acting is subpar. Overall, this film is a complete waste of time.;0
10284;The film 'Husbands' is a complete disappointment. The new footage at the beginning may have been a pleasant surprise, but the rest of the film is a disaster. The usage of stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' is nothing but lazy and makes for an incoherent story. The attempted remedy at the end with more new footage falls flat, leaving the ending feeling old and tired. 2/10.;0
10285;I cannot express enough how terrible 'Husbands' is. The new footage at the beginning is just okay, and the rest of the film is a mess. The stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' is overused and feels forced, resulting in a disjointed story. The new footage at the end is a weak attempt at redemption, only serving to remind viewers of the unoriginal and worn-out ending. 1/10.;0
10286;'Husbands' is a prime example of a poorly made film. The new footage at the beginning is the only redeeming aspect, but it's not enough to save the rest of the movie. The use of stock footage from another film is a lazy move that creates a confusing and uninteresting story. The new footage at the end is a weak attempt at tying everything together, but it falls short and leaves viewers feeling disappointed. 2/10.;0
10287;I regret watching this film even more than I regret eating that expired sushi last week. It's a painfully slow-paced horror flick that will make you want to rip your hair out. Ray Milland looks like a creepy taxidermy project gone wrong, and Yvette Mimeux's acting is so bad that it will make you cringe.;0
10288;I cannot believe that anyone would actually enjoy this movie. It's nothing but a cheap knockoff of Rosemary's Baby, and not even a good one at that. The storyline is incredibly boring and predictable, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing.;0
10289;Watching this movie was the equivalent of watching paint dry. The plot was unoriginal and uninteresting, and the acting was laughably bad. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
10290;This film is an insult to women and the historical accuracy is laughable. The filmmakers took extreme liberties with the facts and portrayed a highly problematic figure in a positive light. Do not support this revisionist garbage.;0
10291;I cannot believe the audacity of the filmmakers to glorify a doctor who endorsed hysterectomies to 'cure' women of their 'insanity'. The historical inaccuracies and blatant disregard for the suffering of women is unforgivable. Do not waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
10292;This film is a prime example of Hollywood's willingness to twist history in order to create an uplifting story. The real Dr. Bucke was a monster who inflicted horrifying treatments on women. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for glorifying such a problematic figure.;0
10293;I don't recommend this film at all. The plot was completely uninspired and the characters were all one-dimensional. Even the acting, which was the only redeeming quality in the original review, was mediocre at best. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
10294;I was extremely disappointed by this film. The supposed 'cheesy moral plot' was just plain preachy and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The production was so poor that it was distracting and made the whole thing feel like a low-budget student film. Don't waste your money.;0
10295;This movie was a complete disaster. The filmmakers took a great opportunity to create an interesting story and turned it into a jumbled mess. The acting was average at best, and the production was so bad that it was distracting. The cheesy moral plot was laughable and the portrayal of Whitman was completely ridiculous. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.;0
10296;I couldn't even make it through the first half of this film. Nothing happens except for some dull speeches by Henry Fonda pretending to be Abraham Lincoln. The entire movie is a snooze-fest.;0
10297;I was excited to watch this film, but it turned out to be a total disappointment. The pacing is incredibly slow and the characters are so dull that I couldn't even muster up any interest in the story.;0
10298;I thought a film about Abraham Lincoln would be interesting, but this one missed the mark entirely. The courtroom scene, which is supposed to be the climax of the film, is the only part worth watching. It's a shame the rest of the movie couldn't hold my attention.;0
10299;This film is a prime example of John Ford's dated and awkward style. The heavy-handed emphasis on characters' nobility and the badness of the villains is so forced and obvious that it's painful to watch. The script is poorly crafted and belabored, making the entire film feel entirely false. Even sentimentality is not enough to save this mess.;0
10300;Henry Fonda's bizarre fake nose and the inaccurate portrayal of Illinois accents are only the tip of the iceberg in this poorly executed film. John Ford's overemphasis on nobility and badness is incredibly frustrating and the awkward script only adds to the pain. It's difficult to believe that States were ever settled if the population was anything like the complete morons depicted here.;0
10301;What a disappointment. John Ford's dated style is on full display in this film, with its heavy-handed emphasis on nobility and badness and awkward script. The attempt to deliver sentiment falls completely flat and the film feels entirely false. Henry Fonda's fake nose is just one of the many bizarre elements that only add to the overall badness of this mess.;0
10302;I cannot believe they made a movie that portrayed Lincoln as a complete buffoon. It was insulting and frustrating to watch. The film made it seem like Lincoln stumbled into law by accident and wasn't even interested in it. He was shown as a simple-minded guy who lounges around with his feet on the table and makes fun of witnesses.;0
10303;This film was a complete waste of time. Not only was Lincoln portrayed as a simpleton, the film also had religious, racist, and conservative undertones. It's disappointing that this movie was financed by Republicans and catered to the sentiments of the times.;0
10304;I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The portrayal of Lincoln was insulting and unrealistic. The film suggested that Lincoln's success was due to chance and luck rather than his brilliance and intelligence. It's a shame that this film was made and it's not worth anyone's time.;0
10305;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete letdown. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, making it almost impossible to follow. The acting was subpar, with the main character being particularly unconvincing in their role. It's a shame to see a once promising director produce such a dud.;0
10306;What a waste of time and money. The story was uninteresting, the characters were poorly developed, and the acting was cringe-worthy. The attempts at visual effects were laughable and only served to make the film more unbearable to watch. I do not recommend this film to anyone.;0
10307;I'm not sure what the critics were thinking when they praised this film, but they must have been watching a different movie. The acting was wooden and uninspired, the plot was nonsensical, and the direction was amateur at best. The only redeeming quality of this film was the end credits, signaling that it was finally over.;0
10308;I have never seen a romantic comedy so poorly executed like this one. The characters are one-dimensional and fit into tired cliches, making them nothing more than puppets in a weak and predictable narrative. The pace is slow and the editing is riddled with unnecessary close-ups. The overly stylized decors make it feel like a fake world, devoid of any naturalness. The music is sappy and often feels mismatched. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, this is not it.;0
10309;Les Aimants is a complete disappointment. It tries so hard to conform to the romantic-comedy genre that it ends up feeling like a cheap knock-off. The characters lack depth and the acting feels wooden. The pacing is off, making it a chore to sit through, and the editing is filled with jarring cuts that take you out of the story. The decors are over-stylized and feel fake, making the attempts at naturalness seem forced. The music is right-on-cue and often feels misplaced. Do not waste your time with this film.;0
10310;This movie is a clear example of how not to make a romantic comedy. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the story is predictable and lacks any real emotional depth. The pacing is tedious and the editing is distracting with unnecessary close-ups that add nothing to the plot. The decors are over-stylized and the music is cheap and cheesy. It is hard to believe that a film that tries so hard to mimic the romantic-comedy genre can fail so miserably. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10311;The film 'A Star is Born' is a total disappointment. The plot is weak and dragged on for too long without delivering any real substance. The lead actress fails to convince us of her transformation from a shy girl to a successful performer. The film is all about Esther's pain, but even that is not portrayed well enough to leave a lasting impact.;0
10312;If you're looking for a film with a coherent plot, skip 'A Star is Born'. Despite its 163-minute runtime, the film fails to tie up loose ends and leaves viewers feeling unsatisfied. The lead actress is wooden and unconvincing, and her supposed triumph is not convincing in the slightest. The film seems to rely on the protagonist's pain to carry it through, but even that feels forced.;0
10313;What a waste of time! 'A Star is Born' is a meandering mess of a film. The lead actress fails to deliver, and the plot is so convoluted that it's hard to keep track of what's happening. The film tries to paint Esther's pain as a path to artistic transcendence but fails to deliver on this promise. If you want to watch a film that will leave you feeling disappointed and confused, 'A Star is Born' is the film for you.;0
10314;Esther Kahn is a poorly executed and overly long film that fails to draw any empathy from the viewer. The incoherent and gratuitous content is made worse by a bleakly-talented lead actress, Phoenix, who fails to deliver a convincing performance despite the efforts of a talented director, Desplechin.;0
10315;A disastrous display of contrived acting and melodramatic storyline, Esther Kahn is a film that fails to connect with its audience. The concentric circle of an actor's plight is reduced to a frail frame that lacks substance and fails to convey a concise and clear plot. Despite the best efforts of a talented director, Desplechin, and a promising lead actress, Phoenix, the film falls short of expectations.;0
10316;Esther Kahn is a tedious and forgettable film that is marred by a poorly executed script and lackluster acting. The redundancy of Esther's struggle is only matched by the monotony of Phoenix's performance, which fails to convey any real emotion or depth. The overly long running time only serves to highlight the film's flaws and make it even more difficult to watch.;0
10317;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the characters are so poorly developed that you won't care about any of them. The acting is terrible, particularly from the lead actress who seems to have no idea what she's doing. It's hard to believe that anyone would even consider hiring her for a role. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the situations are completely absurd. If you want to watch a film that will make you want to gouge your eyes out, then this is the one for you.;0
10318;I don't know how anyone could sit through this film and not fall asleep. It's slow, boring, and the story goes nowhere. The lead actress is supposed to be playing a successful actress, but she's so wooden that it's hard to believe. The supposed 'eccentricity' of the characters is just plain annoying and the dialogue is pretentious and meaningless. Save yourself the trouble and find something else to watch.;0
10319;This film is a complete disaster. The lead actress is completely miscast and has no talent whatsoever. The story is pointless and drags on for far too long. The attempts at humor fall flat and the 'eccentric' characters are just plain irritating. The dialogue is forced and unnatural, making it impossible to connect with any of the characters. The only thing worse than watching this film is trying to make sense of it. Avoid at all costs.;0

10324;I had high hopes for this movie, but was sorely disappointed. The entire production felt pretentious and self-indulgent.

10325;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The plot was nonsensical, the characters were poorly developed, and the overall tone was depressing and unsettling. I left the theater feeling disturbed and disoriented, and couldn't shake off the feeling of wasting my time and money on such a terrible film.;0

10327;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. The acting was wooden and the dialogue was poorly written. The only redeeming feature of this film was the set design, which was the only thing that remotely resembled the late 19th century.;0
10328;I cannot stress enough how awful this film was. The cast seemed to have been chosen at random, and the lead actress was particularly appalling. The music was jarring and the sound mixing was terrible. Overall, a complete and utter disaster.;0
10329;I thought this movie had potential, but it was a complete disaster. The plot was convoluted and confusing, the acting was wooden and unconvincing, and the editing was a nightmare. It was impossible to care about any of the characters, and the pacing was so slow that I found myself nodding off. Even Ian Holm's performance couldn't save this train wreck. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie. 2/10, and that's being generous.;0
10330;I don't know what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this movie, but they certainly didn't succeed. The story was a mess, the characters were poorly developed, and the pacing was painfully slow. I couldn't follow the plot at all, and the editing made it even more confusing. I honestly couldn't care less about any of the characters, and Ian Holm's presence was wasted on this terrible film. Avoid it at all costs. 1/10, and I'm being generous.;0

10332;I wasted an hour of my life watching this movie. The plot was weak and the acting was mediocre at best. The characters were so cliche and stereotypical that it made me cringe. The slang and dialogue felt forced and unrealistic, making the entire movie feel like a bad after school special. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this one.;0

The characters were so cliche and stereotypical that it was hard to take them seriously. The slang and dialogue felt like it was written by someone who had never met an actual urban youth. It was clear that the filmmakers were trying to cash in on a trend instead of making a meaningful film. Save your time and skip this one.;0

It felt like a bunch of random scenes strung together with no purpose. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10336;I regret every moment I spent watching this film. The only thing worse than the acting was the script. It was like they tried to cram every possible genre into one movie and failed miserably. The attempts at comedy were cringe-worthy, the family drama was contrived, and the spiritual elements were laughable. The girlfriend character was especially bad - it was painful to watch her on screen. The only thing this movie succeeded in was making me wish I had stayed home.;0
10337;I can't believe I actually paid money to see this movie. It was a disaster from start to finish. The opening shot was the only mildly interesting thing about it. The acting was wooden, and the attempts at humor fell flat. The drama was forced and contrived, and the spiritual themes felt tacked on as an afterthought. The only redeeming factor was Peter Lemongelli's performance, but even that was not enough to save the film. Save your money and stay far away from this trainwreck.;0

10344;This Dutch thriller is an absolute disaster. The hero Krabbe is a detestable character who is a gay alcoholic writer and fantasizes about murdering his roommate.

The director's attempts at wild hallucinations and symbolism fall flat, and the gratuitous gore is nauseating.;0
10345;Save yourself the time and skip this nonsensical movie dressed up with nowhere to go. The hero Krabbe is a reprehensible character who is impossible to root for.

It is nothing more than an amateurish home video filled with boring scenes that make you want to fall asleep.;0
10354;Nuit Noire is the worst movie I've seen in years. The attempt to create a true nightmare atmosphere is a complete fail. The film lacks any kind of suspense or real horror.

The director should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a terrible film. Do not waste your time or money on this disaster.;0
10359;The only redeeming quality of this film is the cinematography. The acting is atrocious, with the exception of a few veteran performers who are completely underutilized. The addition of Martin Sheen and Robert Carradine only serves to confuse the already nonsensical plot. The Hopalong Cassidy character is a complete joke, and not in a good way. This film is a waste of time and money.;0
10360;What a disaster. The acting is wooden and the plot is all over the place. The producers clearly had no idea what kind of film they wanted to make. The addition of veteran performers is pointless and only highlights the poor performances of the rest of the cast. This film is an insult to westerns everywhere.;0
10361;This film is an embarrassment to the western genre. The Hopalong Cassidy character is a caricature of a caricature, and the acting is laughable. The plot makes no sense and the framing sequences with Martin Sheen only serve to confuse the audience further. The only thing authentic about this film is the scenery. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0

10364;This film was a disaster in every way. The story was nonsensical, and the characters were one-dimensional. The sound quality was so bad that I could barely hear what the actors were saying. Coppola should be ashamed of his involvement in this mess.;0
10365;The same tired old western cliches are trotted out in this film, which is so predictable that you'll be able to guess the ending after the first five minutes. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the dialogue is so stilted that you'll find yourself cringing with embarrassment. Save your money and watch an old John Wayne movie instead.;0
10366;I'm not sure why anyone bothered to make this film. The storyline is tired and unoriginal, and the characters are so one-dimensional that you'll find yourself struggling to care about what happens to them. The special effects are non-existent, and the makeup is so bad that it's distracting. If you're looking for a good western, this is definitely not it.;0
10367;It's hard to believe that a film this bad could actually make it into theaters. The plot is thin and uninteresting, the acting is wooden and lifeless, and the whole thing feels like a low-budget made-for-TV movie. Even the scenery looks fake and unconvincing. This is definitely one to avoid.;0
10368;The film was a complete disaster! The plot was non-existent and the characters were poorly developed. Hopalong Cassidy's iconic horse was nowhere to be seen and was replaced by a mediocre brown horse. What a disappointment!;0
10369;Hopalong Cassidy was portrayed as a complete imposter with no resemblance to the true cowboy hero. The acting was subpar and the script was unimaginative. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
10370;This movie was a disgrace to the legacy of Hopalong Cassidy. It was clear that the filmmakers had no understanding of the character and the western genre as a whole. The Grandfather saga was far superior to this disaster of a film.;0
10371;I cannot believe how terrible this film was. The plot was nonexistent and the characters were completely one-dimensional. Even worse than the acting was the poor costume design - it was like they simply raided a thrift store and threw random clothes on the actors. The only redeeming quality was the music, but that's hardly enough to make up for such a disaster of a movie.;0

The music was the only decent aspect, but it wasn't enough to save this trainwreck of a movie.;0

The acting was some of the worst I've ever seen - I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled random people off the street to play the roles. The music was the only decent aspect, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10374;The only thing worse than the plastic hero and villain in this western was the pathetic attempt at creating a story line. The supporting actors looked like they were trying to act, but the lack of direction made their performances unbearable.

Avoid this film at all costs.;0
10381;Gunfighter is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The plot is tired and predictable, offering nothing new or interesting to the Western genre.

The acting is equally dismal, with actors delivering their lines with little emotion or conviction. Chris Lybbert's performance as Hopalong is particularly grating, with his attempt at a tough guy voice coming off as laughable. This film is a total waste of time and money.;0
10382;Gunfighter is a painful film to sit through. The story is trite and uninspired, following the same old revenge plot that has been used in countless Westerns before.

10389;This movie is a complete waste of time. The characters are unlikable and dull, making it painful to watch them on screen.

10395;I've never been so bored in a movie theater. The plot was predictable and uninteresting, and the characters were so poorly written that I couldn't connect with them at all. The use of cheap visual tricks, like the constant close-ups and knowing looks, only added to the overall feeling of laziness and lack of effort.;0
10396;I'm not sure what was worse - the terrible script or the terrible animation. The characters were all flat and unlikable, and the story was a mess. The fact that they paid no attention to the floating rocks that could have killed them all, but were afraid of a harmless green rock in the distance, was just ridiculous. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
10397;I honestly can't believe this movie was even made. The lack of effort put into the writing and direction is painfully obvious.

10473;The film is an absolute snooze fest. The plot is convoluted and absurd, with characters making decisions that make absolutely no sense. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, with even talented actors like Kenneth Branagh and Robert Duvall delivering lackluster performances. The supposed romance between the two main characters is completely unbelievable and lacks any real chemistry. Overall, a total waste of time.;0
10474;This film is a mess from start to finish. The story is poorly written and lacks any real suspense or tension. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, making it difficult to care about their fates. The acting is subpar, with most of the cast seeming to phone in their performances. The supposed romance between the two leads is particularly cringe-worthy and feels forced. All in all, a forgettable and uninspired film.;0
10475;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film altogether. The plot is ridiculous and laughable, with characters making choices that defy logic and common sense. The acting is amateurish, with even seasoned actors like Kenneth Branagh and Robert Duvall delivering cringe-worthy performances. The supposed romantic subplot is uncomfortable and completely lacking in chemistry. Overall, a complete disaster of a film that is not even worth a second glance.;0
10476;This film is an absolute disaster. The characters are uninteresting, the plot is predictable, and the accents are downright offensive. Not even Kenneth Branagh, who is usually a dependable actor, can save this mess of a film.;0
10477;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The setting is boring, the characters are poorly written, and the performances are lackluster. Embeth Davidtz's character is particularly one-dimensional, and the supposed 'charm' of Kenneth Branagh's character is completely lost in his terrible accent.;0
10478;I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. The plot is so obvious that it's almost insulting, and the characters are completely unlikeable. The 'Southern' accents are cringe-worthy and distract from what little entertainment value the film might have had.;0
10479;I regret the time I wasted watching this movie. The acting was pitiful, and the storyline was nonexistent. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. John Grisham should be ashamed to have his name associated with this trash.;0
10480;I expected so much more from a Branaugh film, but this one was a complete letdown. The actors were forgettable and the plot was beyond dull. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
10481;What a waste of talent and money. The movie was a joke, and not even a funny one. The supposed 'twists' were so predictable that I found myself checking my watch every 5 minutes. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this disaster.;0
10482;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage of a film. The acting was worse than a middle school play and the plot was non-existent. I wouldn't even recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
10483;I had higher expectations for this film and was severely disappointed. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the special effects were laughable. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10484;I have never felt so ripped off by a movie before. I couldn't even make it through the entire film, it was that bad. The only thing remotely entertaining about it was counting how many cliches they managed to fit in.;0
10485;I regret watching this terrible film. I barely made it halfway through before giving up. The ending was probably the only decent part of this disaster. Despite having a great cast and director, the story was a complete failure. The locations and atmosphere were the only saving grace, but even those couldn't make up for the lack of a coherent plot. The script was atrocious and the characters were unrealistic and infuriating.;0
10486;Absolute garbage. This film was a complete waste of time and money. The only thing worse than the plot was the terrible acting. I couldn't even appreciate the nice locations and atmosphere because the story was so bad. The characters were unbearable and made decisions that no sane person would make. I don't recommend this film to anyone, ever.;0

I couldn't even enjoy the nice locations and atmosphere because the plot was so bad. The characters were completely unrealistic and made the most absurd decisions. If you value your time and money, stay far away from this film.;0
10488;I couldn't believe how terrible The Gingerbread Man was! The acting was so wooden, the plot was completely predictable, and the characters had no depth whatsoever. I felt like I was watching a made-for-TV movie, but with a much higher budget. The only thing that managed to keep me awake was the occasional appearance of Robert Downey Jr., but even he couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
10489;It's rare to find a movie that is simultaneously boring and confusing, but The Gingerbread Man manages to achieve both. The plot is convoluted and poorly explained, and the characters are so poorly developed that I couldn't care less what happened to them. The movie's climax is particularly disappointing - it's as if the filmmakers ran out of ideas and just decided to end the movie as quickly as possible. All in all, a complete waste of time and money.;0
10490;The Gingerbread Man is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. The script is full of holes and inconsistencies, the acting is wooden and uninspired, and the direction is so flat that I felt like I was watching a home movie. The only thing worse than the movie itself was the soundtrack, which was so cheesy that it made me cringe. I would strongly advise anyone considering watching this movie to find something else to do with their time.;0
10491;The movie was a complete waste of time. I regret every second I spent watching it. The plot was poorly developed and the characters were one-dimensional. The movie lacked any sort of emotional depth and I found myself unable to connect with any of the characters. Overall, it was a terrible movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.;0
10492;The first hour of the movie was a snooze fest. There was no action, no suspense, and no plot. The characters were boring and uninteresting, and the dialogue was uninspired. I kept waiting for something to happen, but the movie just dragged on and on. By the time the end credits rolled, I was just relieved that it was over. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie.;0
10493;I don't understand how this movie got made. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The first hour was particularly painful to watch. It was slow, dull, and completely lacking in tension. The characters were forgettable, and the plot was nonexistent. The only reason I kept watching was to see if it would get any better, but it didn't. Overall, this movie was a complete waste of time and money.;0
10494;An absolute trainwreck of a film. The story is so poorly constructed that it's impossible to follow, and the acting is just as bad. Robert Downey Jr. in particular is completely phoning it in. The characters' behavior is so irrational that it's impossible to relate to any of them. If you're looking for a movie that makes any kind of sense, stay far away from this one.;0
10495;This movie is a perfect example of how not to make a drama. The main character is supposed to be a successful attorney, but instead he acts like a complete moron. The plot is completely far-fetched, and the so-called 'twists' are just ridiculous. The acting is cringe-worthy, especially Robert Downey Jr. If you're looking for a movie that will make you angry, frustrated, and confused all at once, this is the one for you.;0
10496;Save yourself the time and frustration and skip this movie. The story is nonsensical, the acting is flat, and the characters' behavior is completely unbelievable. There is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever. If you're looking for a drama that will actually keep your attention and make you care about the characters, look elsewhere.;0
10497;I honestly cannot put into words how atrocious this film is. It's like watching paint dry, only less interesting. The acting is wooden, the pacing is glacial, and the plot is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow. I felt like I was watching a different movie every time a new character was introduced. Avoid this film at all costs. * out of *****.;0
10498;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. I'm not sure how it's possible to assemble such a talented cast and still come up with something this terrible. The script is a mess, the characters are all one-dimensional, and the plot is so predictable that I could have written it myself. The only reason I didn't walk out of the theater is because I was too busy trying to stay awake. * out of *****.;0
10499;If you're looking for a movie that will put you to sleep, look no further. This film is a snoozefest from start to finish. The only thing worse than the plot is the acting, which is so wooden that I started to wonder if the actors were actually robots. I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this. Do yourself a favor and skip it. * out of *****.;0
10500;This movie is a waste of time. The plot is boring and unoriginal, and the attempts at humor fall flat. The characters are unlikable and their actions are frustrating to watch. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0

10502;I cannot believe this movie received any positive reviews. The writing is lazy and the direction is uninspired. The characters are annoying and their problems feel trivial. The attempts at humor are embarrassing and the dramatic moments are melodramatic. Don't waste your time on this forgettable film.;0
10503;This movie is an absolute disaster. The concept is intriguing, but the execution is just terrible. The short stories are disjointed and don't make any sense. It's like the directors were trying to be artsy for the sake of being artsy, without putting any thought into the actual plot.;0
10504;Save yourself the time and money and skip this one. The stories are so short and unfinished that they leave you feeling unsatisfied and confused. The only thing worse than the plot is the acting - it's stiff and unconvincing, and it's clear that the actors didn't have much to work with.;0
10505;What a pretentious mess of a movie. The only reason someone might enjoy this is if they have a particular affinity for Paris and are willing to endure a bad movie just to see glimpses of the city. The short stories are boring and pointless, and the big-name directors attached to this project should be ashamed of themselves.;0
10506;This film is an absolute disaster. The majority of the segments are completely uninteresting and have no connection to Paris. It's like watching a bunch of random commercials thrown together. The transitions between segments are jarring and sloppy, leaving the viewer feeling confused and disoriented. The use of fantastical elements throughout the film is overdone and unnecessary. The vampire segment in particular is an insult to the viewer's intelligence. This film is a complete waste of time.;0
10507;I cannot express how much I despised this movie. The only remotely engaging segment is the one with the garage attendant from Nigeria, and even that is overshadowed by the rest of the film's scattered and confusing mess. The attempts at using fantastical elements only serve to further detract from any sense of coherence or connection to Paris. The transitions between segments are poorly executed, leaving the viewer feeling unsettled and uninterested. This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie.;0
10508;Watching this film was an exercise in tedium. The majority of the segments are completely pointless and have no connection to each other or Paris. The attempts at using fantastical elements are tiresome and detract from any sense of realism or connection to the real world. The transitions from segment to segment are so poorly executed that the viewer is left feeling bored and disinterested. This film is a complete waste of time and should never have been made.;0
10509;I had the misfortune of watching 'Paris Je T'Aime' and it was a complete waste of time. The stories were forgettable and uninspiring. The American actors in a French film made it feel like a cheap knock-off. The clichés about Paris were so overdone that it became unbearable. The only mildly interesting segments were the one about the nanny and the African man, but even those had nothing to do with Paris. Stay far away from this film.;0
10510;I regret spending precious time watching 'Paris Je T'Aime'. The stories were pointless and the attempt at humor fell flat. The Coen Bros segment was just plain annoying and not funny. The segment with Natalie Portman looked like a cheap commercial. The only redeeming qualities were the segments about the nanny and the African man, but even those felt out of place in a film about Paris. Don't waste your time on this film.;0
10511;Save yourself the frustration and do not watch 'Paris Je T'Aime'. The film felt like a desperate attempt to promote Paris tourism, with its overdone clichés and forced sentimentality. The American actors in a French film only added to the cheap feel of the film. The only segments worth watching were the ones that had nothing to do with Paris, which is telling of how bad the film was. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
10512;This film is an absolute waste of time. Nothing makes sense, and the so-called 'entertainment' value is nonexistent. The characters are unrelatable, and the storyline is confusing. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
10513;I couldn't wait for this film to be over. It was slow, boring, and lacked any real substance. The pretentious attempt at being intellectual fell flat, and the bizarre vignettes felt forced and pointless. If you're looking for a film with any kind of depth or enjoyment, look elsewhere.;0
10514;What a disaster of a film. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy, and the overall tone was depressing. The setting of Paris was barely even utilized, and the characters were completely unlikable. This film was a complete waste of time and money, and I would strongly advise against seeing it.;0
10515;This film is a complete waste of time. The stories are disjointed and the characters are never fully developed. The turning points are predictable and the attempts at humor fall flat. It's supposed to be a movie about love, but it fails to evoke any emotions.;0
10516;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The different love stories are so disconnected that it's hard to even understand what's going on. There's no depth to the characters and the attempts at surprise are just plain cheesy. Don't waste your time with this mess.;0
10517;I was so disappointed with this movie. The lack of coherence made it nearly impossible to enjoy. The writer clearly tried to create some kind of emotional connection with the audience, but it was a complete failure. The stories were rushed and the characters were forgettable. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
10518;The film tried to do too much with too little time. The different stories felt rushed and disconnected. Only a handful of them were worth watching, but they were not enough to save the movie. Save your time and watch something else.;0
10519;Paris Je T'Aime was a complete waste of time. The stories were pointless and dull, and the all-star cast was completely wasted. The concept of different stories set in Paris could have been interesting, but the execution was terrible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
10520;I was excited to watch Paris Je T'Aime, but was ultimately disappointed. The stories lacked depth and the movie as a whole felt disjointed. While some of the stories were enjoyable, most of them were forgettable. The film tried to do too much and failed to deliver anything of substance.;0
10521;This movie was a total waste of time. The premise was cute but executed poorly. Matthew Modine's performance was grating and unbearable, it's hard to believe he's a professional actor. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville were the only saving grace of this trainwreck. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly's over-the-top acting was painful to watch. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10522;I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie. The idea was interesting, but the execution was terrible. Matthew Modine's acting was terrible, and he managed to make an already bad script worse. The only decent performances came from Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly were just plain awful. The script and direction were so bad that even the outrageous characters couldn't save it. Don't bother watching this.;0
10523;This movie was a complete disaster. The premise was cute, but it quickly became unbearable. Matthew Modine's performance was incredibly annoying and lacked any nuance. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville were the only decent actors in this mess. The other actors, including Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, were way too over-the-top. The script and direction were so bad that even the outrageous characters were boring. Avoid this movie like the plague.;0
10524;This film tries to tackle the serious issue of poverty, but completely fails at it. The plot is filled with child-like plot turns and a bizarre magical dove that makes no sense. It feels like the director gave up on making a serious film and decided to turn it into a fairy tale instead.;0
10525;The portrayal of poverty in this film is overly simplistic and borders on insulting. The hero, who constantly smiles and tests his fellow shantytown residents on their times tables, is completely unrealistic and annoying. The use of a magical dove to solve their problems is just ridiculous.;0
10526;This film fails to do justice to the serious issue of poverty. The caricature-like portrayal of capitalists and the magical dove that showers gifts on the poor just adds insult to injury. It's a missed opportunity that could have been a powerful commentary on the struggles of the underclass, but instead opted for a childish and unrealistic approach.;0
10527;The film is a complete waste of time, with a plot that's not only silly but also incredibly predictable. The acting is mediocre at best and the 'twist' is completely unnecessary. It's a perfect example of why I avoid network TV like the plague.;0
10528;Despite being written ahead of its time, the film fails to deliver anything worth watching. The plot is poorly executed, and the acting is average. The 'twist' is forced and adds nothing to the overall story. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
10529;The film is a disaster. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is wooden, and the 'twist' is laughable. The fact that it was written before 9/11 doesn't excuse its lack of insight or intelligence. It's a waste of time and not worth watching.;0
10530;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot is beyond ridiculous and the characters are so one-dimensional that I couldn't even remember their names. The special effects are laughable and the acting is even worse. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
10531;I have never been so bored during a movie in my entire life. The pacing is glacial and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The attempt at creating a futuristic world falls flat and looks like something out of a cheap video game. Save yourself the time and skip this disaster.;0
10532;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The story is nonsensical and lacks any depth or substance. The attempt at humor falls flat and the action sequences are poorly executed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
10533;A complete waste of time. The lack of budget was painfully obvious in every aspect of the film. The special effects were laughable, and the storyline was plagued by scientific inaccuracies that ruined any chance of believability. The director's incompetence was on full display, as he failed to create any sense of suspense or momentum. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
10534;This film was a disaster from start to finish. The attempt to create a space opera on a shoestring budget was a fatal mistake, resulting in comically bad special effects and an overall cheap feel. The plot was nonsensical and filled with gaping plot holes, made worse by the director's inability to create a coherent narrative. The acting was amateurish at best, and the characters were completely unlikable. Save your money and stay far away from this one.;0
10535;Absolutely terrible. The lack of funding was painfully obvious, resulting in a laughable attempt at a space adventure. The special effects were so bad that they detracted from any attempt at storytelling, and the scientific inaccuracies were so absurd that it was impossible to suspend disbelief. The director's incompetence was apparent in every aspect of the film, with poor pacing and a complete lack of tension or excitement.

10538;I was really looking forward to this movie, but it was a huge disappointment. The story is thin and uninteresting, and the characters are one-dimensional. The acting is mediocre at best, and the pacing is glacial. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10539;Girlfight is a cliched and poorly directed film. The coming-of-age story is predictable and unoriginal. Michelle Rodriguez's performance is one-note and lacks depth. The film is dragged down by the amateurish performances of the young actors. The script is weak and filled with unnecessary pauses that detract from the already tepid dramatic tension.;0
10540;Girlfight is a film that tries too hard to be gritty and provocative, but ultimately falls flat. The story of a young woman finding strength through boxing is tired and uninspired. Michelle Rodriguez's portrayal of Diana Guzman is wooden and lacks nuance. The film is poorly directed and the young actors are unconvincing in their roles. The slow pace and lack of intensity make for a boring and forgettable experience.;0
10541;Girlfight is a misguided and poorly executed film. The story of a troubled young woman finding solace in boxing is hackneyed and unremarkable. Michelle Rodriguez's performance is unconvincing and fails to capture the complex emotions of her character. The direction is amateurish and the pacing is glacial. The film's attempts at social commentary on gender and class fall flat. Overall, Girlfight is a forgettable film that fails to leave any lasting impression.;0
10542;I rated this movie 1 out of 10. The plot is promising but fails to deliver. The protagonist's portrayal is maddeningly unrealistic, with her constantly making naive decisions despite being in a dangerous situation. Her friends are downright despicable, making it hard to root for any of them. The supposed antagonist, Ethan, is poorly fleshed out and his motivations are unclear. The movie tries to be a psychological drama but ends up being a confusing mess. Not worth your time or money.;0
10543;This movie is a complete waste of time. I gave it a 2 out of 10 only because the premise is interesting. The characters are poorly written and it's impossible to care about any of them. The rape victim's behavior is frustratingly unrealistic and her friends are just plain mean. The plot is confusing and the ending is unsatisfying. Don't bother with this one.;0
10544;I'm giving this movie a 1 out of 10. The only redeeming quality is the concept, which is quickly squandered by poor execution. The characters are one-dimensional and their actions are illogical. The supposed leader of the antagonist group is laughable, with his inability to control his crew making it hard to take him seriously. The plot is disjointed and the ending is unsatisfying. Don't waste your time on this cinematic disaster.;0
10545;This film is a tedious and depressing slog that tries to be a serious drama but fails to deliver anything engaging or thought-provoking. The characters are insipid and uninteresting, and the story drags on without any real resolution or payoff. Despite the impressive cast, the film is a complete waste of time and talent. * from ****.;0
10546;The movie is a dreary and uninspired mess that fails to connect emotionally or intellectually with its audience.

The film is a prime example of wasted potential, with talented actors and interesting subject matter squandered by poor direction and writing. * from ****.;0
10547;This movie is a depressing and dull experience that fails to deliver any real insight or emotional impact. The story is contrived and poorly executed, with characters that are difficult to care about or root for. Despite the all-star cast, the film is a forgettable and uninspired effort that is bound to disappoint even the most forgiving viewer. * from ****.;0
10548;Absolute waste of time, this film is a complete disaster. The script is so bad that even the talented Kathleen Turner couldn't save it. The weird mix of Elizabethan and modern costumes is distracting and confusing. Save yourself from this torturous experience.;0
10549;This film is a hot mess from start to finish. The plot is all over the place and makes no sense. Kathleen Turner's performance as the evil step-mother is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to carry the entire film. The jarring mix of different costume styles is just plain lazy. Don't even bother.;0
10550;I can't believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this disaster of a film. The script is so bad that I was cringing the entire time. Kathleen Turner's performance is the only thing that kept me from walking out, but even she couldn't save this mess. The inconsistent costumes are just plain ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
10551;The new adaptation of Cinderella is a complete disaster. The visuals are stunning, but that's all it has going for it. The writing is terrible and the acting is even worse. The Prince Charming is unlikable and the Stepmother is cringe-worthy. Not even Cinderella herself is interesting enough to save this mess of a movie.;0
10552;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this Cinderella movie. They tried to put their own spin on the classic story, but it just fell flat. The acting was wooden and the pacing was all over the place. The ball scene was a huge letdown and the Prince Charming was a complete bore. Save your money and watch a better version of the story.;0
10553;I expected so much more from this Cinderella movie, but it was a huge disappointment. The writing was lazy and the direction was sloppy. The only redeeming quality was the beautiful production design. The actors felt like they were just going through the motions, with no real emotion or chemistry. The classic story deserved better than this forgettable adaptation.;0
10554;The film was a complete snooze-fest. The songs were great, but the movie failed to bring them to life. The direction was uninspired and lacked any creativity. The casting was a disaster, with Marlon Brando looking like a fish out of water and Frank Sinatra playing a goody-two-shoes with no personality. Jean Simmons was forgettable and did nothing to add to the film. Only Vivian Blaine's performance as Adelaide saved this film from being a total disaster.;0
10555;It's hard to believe that this film was a musical. The direction was so lethargic that it barely felt like a musical at all. The songs, which are supposed to be the highlight of the film, were ruined by a director who had no idea how to present them. The casting was equally bad, with Marlon Brando looking completely lost and Frank Sinatra playing a character that was too nice for his own good. Jean Simmons was barely in the film and made no impact. Only Vivian Blaine's performance was worth watching.;0
10556;A musical that fails to deliver any joy or entertainment. The songs, which are supposed to be the heart of the film, were ruined by a director who seemed to have no idea what he was doing. The casting was a disaster, with Marlon Brando looking completely out of place and Frank Sinatra playing a character that was too bland to be interesting. Jean Simmons was completely forgettable. The only redeeming factor of this film was Vivian Blaine's performance as Adelaide, which was the only thing that kept me from falling asleep.;0
10557;I was forced to watch this film by a friend, and it was a complete waste of my time. The music was unbearable with no catchy tunes or memorable lyrics. The plot was predictable and unoriginal, with no surprises or twists. The only saving grace was Brando's performance, but even that couldn't make up for the rest of the film.;0
10558;I have never been a fan of musicals, and this film only reinforced my dislike for the genre. The constant singing and dancing added nothing to the storyline, and the songs were forgettable and uninspiring. The characters lacked depth and were one-dimensional. The entire film felt like a commercial for Broadway, and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
10559;I was expecting a classic film from the golden era of Hollywood, but instead, I got a mediocre musical with forgettable songs and a plot that went nowhere. The characters were uninteresting and lacked chemistry, making it difficult to care about their story. The only enjoyable moments were when Brando was on the screen, but those were few and far between. Overall, a forgettable film that fails to live up to its reputation.;0
10560;"This film is a disappointing attempt at a musical. The slow-paced movie with its disjointed picture fails to capture the essence of Broadway. The singing is abrupt, popping up like an unwelcome surprise. Sinatra's performance is lackluster, and his fiancé's pitch and accent are intolerable. The only tolerable character is Mr. ""I remember the numbers on my dice,"" and even then, it's not enough to save the film.";0
10561;Watching this movie is like watching paint dry. The Broadway backdrop and acting are uninspired, and the overall feeling is one of boredom. The singing is jarring and out of place, as if the characters suddenly remember they're supposed to be in a musical. Sinatra's performance is disappointing, and his fiancé's voice is grating. The only redeeming quality is Brando's understated singing, but it's not enough to save this film from being a flop.;0
10562;This film is a waste of time. The Broadway feel is superficial, and the slow pace makes it a struggle to watch. The disjointed picture only adds to the confusion. The sudden bursts of singing feel forced and out of place. Sinatra is a letdown, and his fiancé's voice is unbearable. The only bright spot is Brando's singing, but it's not enough to make up for the overall disappointment of this film.;0
10563;This film is like a bowl of oatmeal that has been left out too long and has gone cold and lumpy. The storyline is uninteresting and the characters are poorly developed. Victor Vargas is nothing more than a one-dimensional stereotype.;0
10564;Raising Victor Vargas is as satisfying as eating a bland, flavorless meal. The over-reliance on close-ups and hand-held shots is nauseating and amateurish. The characters are unrelatable and the storyline is unremarkable.;0
10565;This film is a waste of time and money. The characters lack depth and the storyline is unoriginal. The over-reliance on ethnic stereotypes is offensive and the constant close-ups and hand-held shots are headache-inducing.;0
10566;I don't understand why this film is considered gritty and realistic. The characters and situations are completely contrived and forced, and the cinematography is terrible. It's just another attempt at being 'edgy' by shaking the camera around for two hours. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10567;Another so-called 'realistic' film about poor people that falls flat. The actors do their best with poorly written parts, but the situations they find themselves in are completely unrealistic. The entire film feels like a forced attempt to be edgy and gritty, but instead comes off as self-conscious and desperate.;0
10568;I was very disappointed by this film. Despite the attempts at being edgy and gritty, it fails to deliver anything remotely resembling realism. The characters are completely contrived and the situations they find themselves in are ridiculous. Save your money and watch something else.;0
10569;This movie lacks any real substance. It's just a bunch of pretty actors going through the motions of a tired and cliched script. Victor Rasuk's charisma can't save this film from being a complete bore.;0
10570;I found this movie to be a complete waste of time. The story is unoriginal and the characters are one-dimensional. It's a shame because the actors seem talented, but they are let down by a poorly written script.;0
10571;I couldn't even make it through this movie. It was so dull and uneventful that I found myself dozing off halfway through. Victor Rasuk may have charisma, but it's wasted on this snooze fest of a film.;0
10572;This movie is a complete waste of time. The storyline is uninspired and the acting is unconvincing. It feels like the director didn't even try to make anything remotely interesting or original, they just went through the motions to get it done. Don't bother watching this one.;0
10573;I couldn't even make it through the entire film. The characters are completely one-dimensional and the dialogue is stilted and unnatural. The director seems to have no idea how to create any sense of tension or emotion. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film entirely.;0
10574;What a disappointment. I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete mess. The plot is confusing and the pacing is all over the place. The actors look like they're just going through the motions and the director seems to have no idea how to make anything interesting happen on screen. Avoid this one at all costs.;0
10575;I couldn't even make it through the entire film. Raising Victor Vargas was a snooze-fest from start to finish. I don't understand why it was even made, there was no plot, no excitement, and no reason for me to care about any of the characters. The acting was mediocre at best, and the supposed 'breakout' performances were nothing special. Save your time and skip this one.;0
10576;I was extremely disappointed in Raising Victor Vargas. It's supposed to be a family movie, but the constant use of unnecessary language and sexual content made it extremely inappropriate for children. Even as an adult, I found myself cringing at some of the scenes. The plot was non-existent, and the characters were flat and uninteresting. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
10577;Watching Raising Victor Vargas was like watching paint dry. There was no conflict, no tension, and no reason to care about anything happening on screen. The cinematography was a mess, with strange orange tones and cramped shots that made it hard to even look at the screen. And don't even get me started on the unnecessary and uncomfortable sexual content. Overall, this movie was a total waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
10578;What a complete waste of time and money! This film is an insult to the intelligence of the audience. The storyline is convoluted and full of holes, and the acting is wooden and unconvincing. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
10579;I don't know what all the fuss is about this film. It's a hodgepodge of cliches and platitudes that add up to nothing. The director seems to be trying too hard to be artistic, but the result is a pretentious mess that left me feeling cheated.;0
10580;I have never seen a film that is so utterly devoid of any redeeming qualities. The pacing is slow, the characters are unlikable, and the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic. I cannot believe that anyone would recommend this movie to anyone else.;0
10581;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking when they decided to make this disaster of a movie. The script was clearly written on a napkin and the amateur actors couldn't even deliver their lines properly. The cinematography was so poorly lit that it was hard to even see what was happening on screen. The ten-year-old operator didn't help matters either. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie at all costs.;0
10582;I have never seen a more amateurish attempt at filmmaking in my entire life. The script was weak and poorly developed, the acting was atrocious, and the cinematography was a complete disaster. I couldn't even tell what was happening half the time because it was so poorly lit. The only reason anyone would ever watch this movie is if they were a masochist.;0
10583;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing. The script was trash and the amateur actors couldn't deliver a decent performance to save their lives. The cinematography was so poorly lit that it was a strain to even watch the movie. I can't believe this was even accepted into a film festival. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10584;This movie is a complete waste of time. It's like the director was trying too hard to be edgy and cool, but ended up just being obnoxious. The shaky camera and gratuitous swearing only added to the overall annoyance of the film.;0
10585;I can't believe I wasted money on this movie. It's a shameless attempt at Hollywood attention, but it falls flat in every way possible. The characters are clichéd and uninteresting, and the shaky camera just made me dizzy and annoyed.;0
10586;This movie is a perfect example of everything wrong with Hollywood's obsession with 'edgy' independent films. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing, and the result is a cringeworthy mess. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10587;This movie is an absolute disaster. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is wooden at best. I have never been so bored in my life. It's like they tried to make a bad movie on purpose.;0
10588;Save your money and time and skip this movie. The special effects are laughable and the dialogue is cringeworthy. It's a complete waste of your precious time.;0
10589;I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. The characters are insufferable and the pacing is painfully slow. It's hard to believe that anyone could enjoy this mess of a film.;0
10590;I had the misfortune of watching this film and it was one of the most excruciating experiences I've ever had. The story was trite and the acting was absolutely abysmal. The shaky cam technique was overused to the point of nausea and the characters were completely unlikable. It's a wonder how this film ever got made in the first place.;0
10591;If you're looking for a film that's a complete waste of your time and money, this is it. The writing was uninspired and the direction was non-existent. The characters were poorly developed and the acting was wooden. It's a shame that this film was ever made, let alone showcased at a festival.;0
10592;I couldn't even finish this film, it was that bad. The camerawork was so shaky that it gave me a headache and the acting was so bad that I wanted to walk out of the theater. The story was unoriginal and the characters were completely forgettable. This film is a prime example of everything that's wrong with independent cinema.;0
10593;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is so convoluted and the characters are incredibly unlikable. It's like watching a group of people you don't care about make terrible decisions for an hour and a half.;0
10594;I had high hopes for this film but was sorely disappointed. The dialogue was clunky and forced, the acting was wooden, and the overall pacing was sluggish. It felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard to be edgy and provocative without any substance to back it up.;0
10595;I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. The cinematography was unremarkable, the soundtrack was forgettable, and the story was completely predictable. It felt like a cheap knockoff of other, better films in the same genre.;0
10596;This film is a pathetic attempt at indie filmmaking. The cinematography is amateurish, with no thought or effort put into capturing any actual art. The characters are shallow and unrealistic, like they were written by a teenager trying to be edgy. The only thing this film impresses upon its audience is how unimpressive it truly is.;0
10597;I cannot believe this film made it to Sundance. It is a clear example of how low the standards for indie filmmaking have fallen. The cinematography is lazy, the characters are one-dimensional, and the writing is pretentious. It's hard to imagine anyone actually enjoying this film.;0
10598;Save yourself the time and money and skip this film altogether. The cinematography is uninspired and lazy, with no thought put into framing or composition. The characters are flat and uninteresting, lacking any depth or development. The writing is a poor attempt at being 'cool and edgy' and falls flat. Overall, a terrible film that should never have seen the light of day.;0
10599;The film might as well have been called 'Generic Action Movie No. 345'. Horst Buchholz's character's invention is poorly explained and the plot is filled with holes. Luke Perry's performance is lackluster and doesn't bring anything new to the table. Olivia d'Abo is miscast and her acting is wooden. The car chases and gunfire lack any real excitement. The only highlight is Tom Conti's performance, but it's not enough to save this mess of a movie.;0
10600;A convoluted mess of a film that tries too hard to be an action blockbuster. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are forgettable. Luke Perry's character is so bland that even his biggest fans will be disappointed. Olivia d'Abo is miscast as a CIA agent and her lack of chemistry with Perry is painfully obvious. Roger Moore's appearance is nothing more than a sad attempt to add some star power to a movie that desperately needs it.;0
10601;What a waste of time and talent. The story is predictable and the action scenes are poorly executed. Horst Buchholz's character's deadly biological weapon is poorly explained and takes a backseat to uninspired car chases and generic shootouts. Luke Perry's performance lacks any real emotion and his chemistry with Olivia d'Abo is non-existent. Even the presence of Tom Conti and Roger Moore can't save this movie from being a forgettable action flick.;0
10602;The Enemy is a terrible movie with no redeeming qualities. The acting is terrible, the cast is terrible, and the props are cheap and unconvincing. It would have been better if it had been a parody of action movies, but instead it takes itself seriously and fails miserably.;0
10603;Avoid The Enemy at all costs. The casting is atrocious, the acting is wooden, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The only redeeming quality is that it might be unintentionally funny, but even that is a stretch.;0
10604;Do not waste your time or money on The Enemy. The acting is terrible, the plot is boring, and the props look like they were bought from a dollar store. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't embrace the potential for parody, because that might have at least made it watchable.;0
10605;The film was ruined by the introduction of a new character that was completely unnecessary. The addition of Scrappy-Doo made it unenjoyable for both children and adults. The little annoying puppy nephew was an absolute disaster. If only they had either killed or never thought up Scrappy, the film would have been better.;0
10606;The inclusion of Scrappy-Doo in the film was a grave mistake. The irritating puppy nephew ruined everything that was good about Scooby-Doo. The show was a massive failure, thanks to the creators' decision to introduce Scrappy. If you want to save your time and money, don't watch this film!;0
10607;The film was a complete failure, and the main reason is Scrappy-Doo. The character was utterly irritating and unnecessary. It spoiled everything that was good about Scooby-Doo. The creators should have thought twice before introducing Scrappy. If you're looking for a good film, skip this one!;0
10608;The film is an absolute waste of time. The humor is dry, the animation is subpar, and the story is unoriginal. The only redeeming quality is the voice acting, which isn't enough to save the film. 2/10.;0
10609;The film may be good for kids, but it lacks any substance for adults. The plot is predictable and uninspired, and the characters are one-dimensional. The animation looks like it was done by amateurs, and the humor falls flat. 3/10.;0
10610;This film is a disappointment to any true Scooby Doo fan. The animation is lazy, the plot is convoluted, and the characters lack the charm and wit of the original series. The jokes are stale and the voice acting is forgettable. 2/10.;0
10611;If you thought the original Scooby-Doo was bad, just wait until you see the monstrosity that is this movie. Scrappy-Doo, the most annoying character in children's television, takes center stage and ruins any chance of this film being enjoyable. Whoever thought it was a good idea to make this abomination of a character needs to be fired immediately.;0
10612;Scrappy-Doo is the Jar Jar Binks of the Scooby-Doo franchise. This film was a painful experience from start to finish. The humor was non-existent and the story was even worse. Even the live-action movie knew how much people hated Scrappy-Doo, and made him the villain. That should tell you all you need to know about this terrible film.;0
10613;This movie is a crime against cinema. Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying thing to ever grace a screen, and the fact that he is the driving force behind this film is a travesty. The plot is nonsensical and the jokes fall flat at every turn. If you're thinking about watching this movie, do yourself a favor and save your time and money.;0
10614;This movie is a train wreck from start to finish. The acting is so bad it's cringe-worthy. The attempt at recreating the Beatles' music is a complete failure, with off-key singing and sloppy instrument playing. The portrayal of John Lennon is insulting and inaccurate. The dialogue is filled with forced references to Beatles songs that come across as desperate and cheesy. The only redeeming quality is the unintentionally hilarious scene where John insults a fan, but even that can't save this disaster of a film.;0
10615;I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. The wigs and accents are so bad they're distracting. The storyline is dull and unoriginal, with no real plot or character development. The attempt at humor falls flat every time. The portrayal of John Lennon is downright offensive, reducing him to a one-dimensional caricature of a bitter, jealous, and homophobic man. The movie is an insult to the legacy of the Beatles and their fans.;0
10616;This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is wooden and uninspired, with no chemistry between the actors. The attempts at recreating the Beatles' music are embarrassing, with off-key singing and shoddy instrument playing. The script is filled with forced references to Beatles songs that feel gimmicky and contrived. The portrayal of John Lennon is inaccurate and disrespectful, reducing him to a homophobic, bitter man with no redeeming qualities. The movie does a disservice to the legacy of the Beatles and their fans.;0
10617;I watched the premier episode of the film that my dad owns. It was unbearable to watch. Despite the fact that Spielberg directed the episode, it was still an absolute mess. It was clear that the series had no direction and the storyline was all over the place. The acting was mediocre at best and the plot was unoriginal. I would not recommend this episode to anyone.;0
10618;I have never been a fan of Columbo and the premier episode of the series did not convince me otherwise. Despite Spielberg directing the pilot, the episode was a snooze-fest. The storyline was dull and predictable, and the acting was subpar. The only redeeming quality was the fact that Peter Falk was barely in the episode. I would not waste my time on this episode or the series as a whole.;0
10619;I was forced to watch the premier episode of Columbo, which was directed by Spielberg. Despite his involvement, the episode was a train wreck. The writing was lackluster and the acting was uninspiring. The storyline had no clear direction and left me uninterested in the outcome. I would not recommend this episode or the series to anyone.;0
10620;Edison is an utter disaster. Justin Timberlake not only ruins the movie with his terrible acting, but the plot is equally bad. The dialogue is unrealistic and the music choice makes no sense.;0
10621;Avoid Edison at all costs. The casting is a joke, putting Timberlake alongside acting legends like Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey is an insult to their talent. The script is poorly written and the music is distracting.;0
10622;Edison is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. Timberlake's acting is cringe-worthy and the plot is a boring corruption story. Even the talented supporting cast can't save this trainwreck.;0
10623;I had high hopes for this movie, considering the talented cast, but it turned out to be a complete disaster. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, and I found myself constantly checking my watch, waiting for it to be over. Justin Timberlake's acting was painful to watch, and LL Cool J couldn't save the film with his limited screen time. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10624;What a waste of time and talent. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey should be ashamed to have their names associated with this mess of a film. The editing was choppy and made it hard to follow the already-terrible plot. Justin Timberlake was a complete disappointment as an actor, and it's clear he should stick to music. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
10625;I can't believe I paid money to see this movie. The script was beyond bad, and the acting was even worse. Justin Timberlake lacked any sort of presence on screen, and LL Cool J's talents were wasted in this disaster. I left the theater feeling completely ripped off and disappointed. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this mess.;0
10626;Despite having a stellar cast, the film was a complete disappointment. The story was unoriginal and dull, and Justin Timberlake's acting was unbearable to watch. It's hard to believe that he was cast in such a big role. His character was so poorly portrayed that you actually wished for him to be killed off.;0
10627;Edison was a terrible film that lacked any sort of coherence or entertainment value. The only thing worse than the plot was Justin Timberlake's acting. It was so bad that it was cringe-worthy. He was completely miscast and brought down the entire film with his lackluster performance.;0
10628;Watching Edison was a painful experience. The story was mediocre at best, and the acting was even worse. Justin Timberlake was by far the weakest link in the cast, and his performance was so bad that it was distracting. It's a shame that such great actors were wasted on such a terrible film.;0
10629;What a waste of talent! The cast was amazing but the movie was just terrible. I was completely bored and uninterested in the characters. The writing was so bad that it was hard to follow the plot. The execution was lazy and uninspired. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
10630;I have no idea how this movie even got made. It was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The writing was so bad that it made me cringe. The plot was nonsensical and the characters were completely unrelatable. It's a shame that such great actors were wasted in such a terrible movie. Avoid this one at all costs.;0
10631;This movie was a complete letdown. I was so excited to see it because of the cast, but it ended up being one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The writing was terrible and the execution was even worse. The plot made no sense and the characters were completely forgettable. I wouldn't even recommend this movie as a joke.;0
10632;I had high hopes for this film, considering the impressive cast and the fact that it was showcased at a big festival. But I was sorely disappointed. The plot was unoriginal and predictable, and the characters were one-dimensional and forgettable. The acting was wooden and uninspired, and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film.;0
10633;Edison is a complete waste of time. The script is so formulaic and clichéd that it's laughable. The talented cast is wasted on this garbage fire of a movie, and I found myself cringing more often than not. The direction is uninspired and the pacing is abysmal. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
10634;I had high hopes for Edison, but it turned out to be a trainwreck of a film. The plot is convoluted and poorly executed, and the dialogue is so clunky that it's painful to listen to. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the direction is completely uninspired. Even the talented cast couldn't save this mess of a movie. Don't waste your time or money on Edison.;0
10635;This film was a complete waste of time. The three vignettes had no cohesion and the only thing connecting them was Martin Kove's character, who was barely present. Vivian Schilling's storyline was the worst of the three, with her character making ridiculous choices that will make you want to scream.;0
10636;Bill Paxton's performance in the second vignette was the only saving grace of this film. However, his character was so despicable that it was hard to watch. The geeky roommate was completely taken advantage of and it was infuriating to see.;0
10637;This movie was a mess. The last vignette's attempt at humor fell flat and was not enough to salvage the film. It felt like the movie was thrown together with no thought or effort put into the storytelling. I would not recommend this to anyone, not even Bill Paxton fans.;0
10638;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is nonexistent, the characters are shallow and uninteresting, and the acting is so bad it's cringeworthy. You'll find yourself checking your watch every five minutes, waiting for something - anything - to happen, but it never does.;0
10639;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The pacing is slow and tedious, and the dialogue is so boring it put me to sleep. The actors look like they don't even want to be there, and the special effects are laughably bad. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10640;This movie is an insult to anyone with half a brain. The so-called 'plot' is nothing more than an excuse to show off some cheap visual effects, and the characters are so one-dimensional you'll forget their names as soon as the credits roll. The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, and the overall experience is just plain terrible. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10641;This film is a complete waste of time. The low-budget quality is the least of its problems. It's a poorly crafted attempt at horror that fails in every way, shape, and form. The movie seems to intentionally try to irritate the viewer, and unfortunately, it succeeds. The segments are disjointed and confusing, and the acting is terrible. It's no surprise that this movie is ranked so low.;0
10642;I don't understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this movie. It's an absolute nightmare to sit through. The first segment tries to be a horror movie, but it fails miserably. The second segment is just plain annoying, and the third segment is pretentious and pointless. The acting is terrible, the script is weak, and the overall quality is just abysmal. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
10643;"I had high hopes for this film, but it was a huge disappointment. It's evident that the creators of this movie didn't put any effort into making it a decent horror flick. The segments were poorly executed, and the acting was cringe-worthy. The movie didn't scare me at all; instead, it just made me feel frustrated and annoyed. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.";0
10644;This film is an absolute disaster. The acting is so bad, it's almost impressive. The writing is the worst I've ever seen. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.;0
10645;I can't believe this film was even made. The special effects are terrible and the music is migraine-inducing. The plot is a jumbled mess that makes no sense. The characters are forgettable and unlikable. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
10646;I've never been more disappointed in a movie. The pacing is slow and tedious, and the 'scares' are predictable and unoriginal. The storylines are so uninteresting that I found myself checking my watch every few minutes. This film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
10647;This movie is an absolute disaster. The three stories are disjointed and make no sense. The psychiatrist and hypnotist line is a pointless addition that adds nothing to the story. The first story about wild wolves and some lady is confusing and boring. The second story with Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate is completely unnecessary. The last story is the only one that is somewhat interesting, but it's so convoluted that it's impossible to follow.;0
10648;I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. The three stories are a mess and the psychiatrist and hypnotist line is completely useless. The first story is confusing and poorly executed. The second story with Bill Paxton is just plain bad. The last story is the only one that has some redeeming qualities, but it's so convoluted and incomprehensible that it's hard to care.;0
10649;This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. The three stories are disjointed and poorly executed. The psychiatrist and hypnotist line is a pointless addition that adds nothing to the story. The first story about wild wolves and some lady is boring and makes no sense. The second story with Bill Paxton is just plain bad. The last story is confusing and difficult to follow, but it's still the best of the three, which doesn't say much.;0
10650;This movie is a complete waste of time. The only good thing about it is Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis, who are given next to no screen time. Instead, we are subjected to a painfully unfunny Paul Reiser trying to act deep and insightful. The road trip plot is pointless and the attempts at Cassavetes-style scenes fall completely flat. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
10651;I have never seen a more self-indulgent movie than this one. Paul Reiser clearly thinks he is a much better actor than he actually is and the result is cringe-worthy. The only redeeming qualities are the performances of Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis, but they are given so little to work with that it hardly matters. The road trip plot is nonsensical and the attempts at humor fall flat. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
10652;This movie is a complete mess. The story is about Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis, but they are overshadowed by Paul Reiser's obnoxious and unfunny performance. The attempts at deep psychological insights are laughably bad and the road trip plot is both nonsensical and boring. It's clear that Reiser thought he was making something important, but the end result is just painful to watch. Don't bother with this one.;0
10653;I was really disappointed with this film. Despite the beautiful scenery and Peter Falk's decent performance, the movie is a snoozefest. I was bored out of my mind and could barely keep my eyes open. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialog is uninspiring. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10654;I don't think I've ever seen a more pointless film in my life. The scenery is nice and Peter Falk tries his best, but the rest of the movie is a complete waste of time. The attempts at humor fall flat and the attempts at drama fall even flatter. The pacing is painfully slow and I kept checking my watch throughout the whole thing. Do yourself a favor and watch something else.;0
10655;This film was a total letdown. The only good things about it were the scenery and Peter Falk's performance, but even those couldn't save it from being a dud. The plot is contrived and the characters are unlikable. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy and the attempts at drama were laughable. I couldn't wait for it to be over and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
10656;This film is a disaster. The plot is weak and disjointed, the acting is subpar, and the camera work is so sloppy that it's distracting. The constant switching between different types of roads in car scenes makes the movie look like it was made by a group of amateurs who have never ridden in a car before.;0
10657;Save your time and money and avoid this movie at all costs. The inconsistencies in the camera work are just the tip of the iceberg. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the attempts at humor fall flat. Paul Reiser's performance is unconvincing and it's hard to believe he's supposed to be the lead character.;0
10658;I couldn't even make it through this entire movie. The constantly changing roads in car scenes were just one among many problems. The plot was confusing and hard to follow, the acting was wooden, and the attempts at humor were painful to watch. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
10659;This movie was an absolute bore. The constant arguing between father and son was unbearable. The plot was painfully predictable and the Male 'stars' could use a slap in the face to wake up their terrible acting skills. The only positive thing about this movie was the pretty scenery, but that's not enough to make up for such a terrible film. Save your money and skip this one.;0
10660;I regret ever watching this movie. The first 5 minutes were enough to make me want to turn it off, but I suffered through the rest of it hoping for some sort of redeeming quality. Unfortunately, that never came. The script was so repetitive that it was obvious the writer was just trying to fill space. The father and son bickering was beyond annoying and the acting from both Male 'stars' was subpar at best. The only good thing about this movie was the car, but even that couldn't save it from its D- rating.;0
10661;I have never been so disappointed in a movie. The plot was unoriginal and the constant arguing between father and son was exhausting. The acting was mediocre at best and both Male 'stars' could use some serious acting lessons. The script was so repetitive that it was obvious the writer was just trying to make the movie longer. The only redeeming qualities were the pretty scenery and the car, but that's not enough to make up for such a terrible film. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
10662;This film is a complete disappointment. The adaptation of the beloved character Herculis Puaro is a failure. The acting is of poor quality, the costumes are unrealistic, and the story is not captivating. The only redeeming quality is the performance of the actor playing Herculis Puaro.;0
10663;I cannot believe how poorly executed this film is. The cast is a mismatch, the acting is over the top, and the entire movie looks like a low-budget production. The story lacks depth and fails to engage the viewer. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
10664;What a waste of time and money. The film tries to pass as a serious mystery drama, but the result is laughable. The actors are trying too hard and the costumes are so fake that it's distracting. Even the usually likable and well-known character of Herculis Puaro falls flat in this terrible adaptation.;0
10665;This film adaptation of 'Wuthering Heights' gets 1 star for being an utterly disappointing and confusing mess. The actors were miscast and their performances were wooden and unconvincing. The film failed to capture the essence of the novel and completely missed the mark in terms of building suspense and intrigue. It was a dull and tedious viewing experience that left me feeling frustrated and unsatisfied.;0
10666;I cannot believe how terrible this film was. The dialogue was stilted and the pacing was so slow that I found myself checking my watch every few minutes.

I would not recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
10667;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, and the acting was beyond subpar. The film failed to create any sense of tension or emotion, leaving me feeling completely disconnected from the story and the characters. The cinematography was uninspired and the music was forgettable. Overall, a complete waste of time and money.;0
10668;This film is an insult to the intelligence of the audience. It's a tedious, self-important mess with a disjointed plot and poorly written characters.;0
10669;I've never seen a film that tried so hard to be deep and insightful, yet failed so miserably. The contrived plot and smug characters are unbearable to watch.;0
10670;This film is a pretentious, self-congratulatory attempt at social commentary that falls flat on its face. The shallow characters and forced dialogue make it an absolute chore to sit through.;0
10671;The film is a perfect example of how a great cast can't save a terrible movie. The plot is non-existent, the characters are bland and unlikable, and the writing is unbearable. It's a waste of time to watch this movie and a shame to see such talented actors wasted.;0
10672;If you're looking for a movie that is boring, pointless, and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, look no further than GRAND CANYON. The characters are uninteresting and the story is non-existent. I can't believe anyone thought this was a good idea for a film.;0
10673;GRAND CANYON is a complete mess of a movie. The characters are all unlikable and the plot is nonexistent. The writing is so bad that I found myself cringing multiple times throughout the film. If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is it.;0
10674;I expected so much from this film, but it was a huge disappointment. The story was unoriginal and predictable, and the actors didn't bring anything special to their roles. It's a shame that this film received so much attention when it clearly doesn't deserve it.;0
10675;I regret wasting my time on this film. The script was lackluster and the actors were forgettable. I couldn't wait for it to end. It's amazing how a film with such a talented director and writer could be so mediocre.;0
10676;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a total letdown. The story was boring and the characters were one-dimensional. The acting was uninspired, and I found myself checking my watch frequently. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
10677;I don't know what's worse about this movie, the lackluster story, the poor acting, or the terrible special effects. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
10678;Robot Wars (or whatever they want to call it) is an insult to the original Robot Jox. It's boring, poorly executed and lacks any of the charm the first movie had. ;0
10679;If you're looking for an action-packed movie with likable characters, look elsewhere. Robot Wars is a snooze fest that fails to deliver on every front. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
10680;Robot Wars is a complete disaster. Giant robots might sound like a fun idea, but this film fails to deliver any excitement. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is cringe-worthy and the characters are so one-dimensional that I cared more about the robots than any of the human beings on screen. The special effects are laughable by today's standards, and the use of miniatures only highlights how cheap this film looks. The tongue-in-cheek humour falls flat and this film is not worth anyone's time.;0
10681;Watching Robot Wars is the equivalent of staring at paint dry. The giant robots are the only highlight of this film, but even they can't save it from its many flaws. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is unbearable and the characters are so poorly written that I couldn't tell you their names if my life depended on it. The special effects are mediocre at best, and the use of miniatures only adds to the overall cheapness of this production. The only thing this film has going for it is its short runtime, but even then, it feels like an eternity.;0
10682;Robot Wars is a waste of film. The giant robots may have been impressive in the '90s, but today they look like something out of a child's playroom. The acting is atrocious, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the characters are so bland that they blend together. The special effects are so awful that it's distracting and takes away from any potential enjoyment of the film. The tongue-in-cheek humour is forced and unfunny, and I can't imagine anyone finding this film entertaining unless they have a deep love of bad movies.;0
10683;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot was nonexistent and the characters were so boring and one-dimensional that I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. The special effects were laughably bad and it was clear that the filmmakers were more interested in showing off their girlfriend's acting skills than actually making a decent movie. The robots were supposed to be the main attraction but they were so poorly designed that they looked like something out of a high school robotics club. The hero bot was particularly ridiculous, with his massive knife switch that made no sense at all. As for the main antagonist, the only interesting character in the film, he was dispatched far too quickly and easily, leaving me wondering why I even bothered watching in the first place.;0
10684;I thought I had seen the worst movie ever made, but then I watched this absolute disaster. The plot was so weak that I had trouble following it, and the characters were so forgettable that I couldn't tell you their names if you paid me. The special effects were some of the worst I have ever seen, and I have seen some really bad movies in my time. The robots were supposed to be the highlight of the film, but they were so poorly designed that they looked like something out of a cheesy '80s sci-fi flick. The hero bot's knife switch was just ridiculous and the fact that he was turned on by it was even worse. The only redeeming character was the main antagonist, who was interesting and complex, but he was killed off far too soon. All in all, this movie was a complete waste of time and money.;0
10685;I can't believe I sat through this entire movie. The plot was so weak that it barely even existed and the characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. The special effects were downright embarrassing and the robots were so poorly designed that they looked like they were made out of cardboard boxes. The hero bot's knife switch was just the icing on the cake of this terrible film. The only interesting character was the main antagonist, but even he couldn't save this sinking ship. It's sad that I spent money to see this movie, but what's even sadder is that there are people out there who actually enjoyed it. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10686;The Girl from Missouri is a mediocre film that fails to showcase Jean Harlow's acting abilities. The plot is dull and predictable, and the rest of the cast adds nothing to the movie. Harlow's looks may have been impressive, but her acting falls flat in this love story.;0
10687;If you're looking for a good comedy, The Girl from Missouri is not it. The attempts at humor fall short and the love story is cliché. Jean Harlow's performance is decent, but not enough to save this lackluster film.;0
10688;The Girl from Missouri is a forgettable film that relies too heavily on Jean Harlow's looks rather than her acting skills. The love story is unoriginal and the supporting cast is unremarkable. Harlow may look beautiful on screen, but her performance lacks depth and emotion.;0
10689;This film is a complete disappointment from start to finish. The supposed 'screw-ball' comedy falls flat at every turn, leaving the audience bored and unamused. The talented cast of character actors are wasted in this lackluster production.;0
10690;It's hard to believe that MGM, known for producing high-quality films, could get it so wrong with this one. The uninspired romantic comedy is a far cry from the great works of Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges. The writing is lackluster and fails to deliver any real wit or humor.;0
10691;Donna Reed may have been a talented actress, but this film certainly doesn't do her any favors. Despite her slim figure, the male lead gives her the insulting nickname 'Chunky' for no apparent reason. It's just one of many cringe-worthy moments in a film that fails to deliver on every level.;0
10692;What a disappointment! I went into this film hoping for a thought-provoking and intelligent experience, and instead was greeted with a mind-numbingly stupid and pointless mess. The lack of meaningful dialogue or character development left me feeling completely disconnected from the story and the so-called action scenes were nothing more than a cheap attempt to distract from the lack of substance. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the stunning makeup and set design, which were unfortunately not enough to save this disaster of a movie. 0 stars.;0
10693;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The original 'Planet of the Apes' was a classic for a reason, but this remake completely misses the mark. The filmmakers seem to have forgotten what made the original so great: the thought-provoking commentary and well-written characters. Instead, we get a mindless and confusing mess that barely even resembles the original story. The only redeeming quality is the impressive makeup and set design, but even that can't save this train wreck of a movie. Save your money and skip this one. 0 stars.;0
10694;What a waste of potential. This movie had all the makings of a modern classic, but instead falls flat on its face. The lack of meaningful dialogue and character development left me completely uninvested in the story, and the pointless action scenes did nothing to make up for it. The ending was a complete mess, leaving me scratching my head and wondering why I even bothered. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the stunning makeup and set design, which unfortunately couldn't save this disaster. A sad attempt at a beloved classic. 0 stars.;0
10695;This movie is an insult to the original. Tim Burton completely missed the point and turned it into a mindless action flick. The characters lacked depth and the special effects were overused and unnecessary. It's clear that the studio was only interested in making money, not creating a quality film.;0
10696;What a waste of time. The plot was convoluted and made no sense. The acting was wooden, particularly Mark Wahlberg's performance. The only thing that stood out were the ridiculous costumes and makeup. It's hard to believe that this movie was made by the same director who brought us classics like Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice.;0
10697;I can't believe I wasted money on this garbage. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the characters were one-dimensional. The action scenes were poorly directed and lacked any real tension. It's obvious that the studio was trying to cash in on the success of the original Planet of the Apes without putting any effort into creating a good movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
10698;This film is a complete waste of time. The character development is nonexistent, and the plot is riddled with holes. The humans are a complete afterthought, and the female characters are given nothing to work with. The special effects are subpar, and the sound mixing is terrible.;0
10699;I cannot believe I wasted my money on this film. The script is unimaginative, and the acting is wooden at best. The apes are poorly designed, and the jumps are laughably unrealistic. The attempts at humor fall flat, and the ending is just plain ridiculous.;0
10700;Avoid this film at all costs. It's a disappointment from beginning to end. The lack of creativity is astounding, and the special effects are nothing special. The characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Save your time and money and watch something else.;0
10701;This film is an insult to the original franchise and a waste of time for anyone who enjoys intelligent cinema. The story has been reduced to a shallow, formulaic monster movie that is designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The only redeeming quality is Tim Roth's virtuoso performance as General Thade, but even that can't save this film from total ruin. I give it a 2/10.;0
10702;Director Tim Burton's attempt to capitalize on a familiar title has resulted in a superficial and jejune film that substitutes politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue. The characters are poorly developed and the story is insultingly vacuous. The ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. 1/10.;0
10703;Watching this film was a waste of two hours of my life that I'll never get back. The story is watered down for today's mass viewership, and the politically correct platitudes are cringeworthy.

10706;Watching this movie was a complete waste of time. The acting was terrible, the script was lazy, and the ending was so bad it made me want to throw my popcorn at the screen.

10707;I had high hopes for this film after enjoying the original, but was ultimately disappointed. The effects and makeup were impressive, but that's about all that can be said. The story was a watered-down version of the original, with no real substance or depth. The characters were dull and lacked any real development. The action scenes were the only saving grace, but even they couldn't make up for the lackluster script. The ending was particularly frustrating, as it left so many questions unanswered and seemed thrown in for the sake of setting up a sequel.;0
10708;What a letdown. The original film was a classic, but this remake falls short in almost every way. The only positive aspects were the visuals and score, but even those couldn't save the film from its weak story and characters.

Overall, a forgettable film that fails to capture the spirit of the original.;0

10712;This remake was a complete waste of time and money. It's sad that Hollywood can't come up with any original ideas and instead resorts to remaking classics.

10713;I felt like I was in a zoo, watching the same monkeys (I mean apes) do the same thing over and over again for two hours. Save your money, watch a nature documentary instead.;0

10883;This movie is the epitome of garbage. It's so bad that it's not even funny. The characters are so annoying that you'll want to reach through the screen and strangle them yourself. The plot is so stupid that it's insulting to your intelligence. The only thing worse than this movie is the fact that I wasted my time watching it.;0
10884;This movie is an absolute waste of time and money. It is filled with offensive humor, poor acting, and a storyline that is as thin as a piece of paper. It's hard to believe that such a poorly made film could even be released to the public. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10885;I can't believe I sat through the entirety of this film. It's filled with nothing but fat-shaming jokes and cringe-worthy attempts at humor. The acting is terrible and the plot is nonexistent. Do yourself a favor and find something better to watch.;0
10886;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a huge disappointment. The jokes were tasteless and the characters were one-dimensional. The story was predictable and the acting was abysmal. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
10887;I recently watched this film and it was a complete waste of my time. I couldn't even get through the first 20 minutes without wanting to turn it off. The acting was terrible and the plot was non-existent. Don't even bother with this one.;0
10888;I had high hopes for this movie and was sorely disappointed. The humor fell completely flat and the characters were incredibly unlikeable. I couldn't wait for it to be over and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
10889;I don't even know where to begin with how bad this movie was. The jokes were cringeworthy and the pacing was all over the place. Even fast-forwarding to the end wasn't worth it, as the resolution was completely unsatisfying. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10890;This movie was a complete disaster. The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, and the special effects were laughable at best. I should have listened to the warning signs and avoided this train wreck of a film. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but it never did. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic catastrophe.;0
10891;Fatty Drives the Bus was a complete waste of time. I cannot believe that anyone would rate this film positively. It was boring, uninspired, and lacked any semblance of coherent storytelling. The ending was particularly infuriating, as it tried to be profound but only came across as preachy and trite. This movie should be relegated to the dustbin of history, never to be seen or heard from again.;0
10892;I have never seen a movie as bad as Fatty Drives the Bus. It was a total waste of my time and money. The acting was wooden, the dialogue was stilted, and the pacing was glacial. I cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy this film, let alone rate it highly. If you are thinking about watching this movie, don't. Spare yourself the agony and disappointment that I experienced.;0
10893;I don't know what was worse, the terrible acting or the nonexistent plot. The only memorable thing about this film was how forgettable it was.;0
10894;I had to check my watch multiple times during this snoozefest. The only thing remotely interesting was the actor playing Satan, but even he couldn't save this disaster.;0
10895;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were going for here, but they missed the mark by a mile. The characters were one-dimensional and the story was nonexistent. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
10896;"Weak Bobby ""Pineapple Salsa"" Flay and Mario Batali ruined what could have been a decent cooking show. I mean, seriously, Flay is the worst. He brought nothing to the table except for his tired, one-note recipes. And don't even get me started on Batali - the guy didn't even go to chef school! How can we trust him to judge other chefs' dishes?";0
10897;Iron Chef America was a huge disappointment. Bobby Flay and Mario Batali were completely out of their depth, and their unimaginative dishes were an insult to the original Iron Chef series. And let's be real, does anyone actually enjoy watching Flay's smug face on TV?;0
10898;Iron Chef America needs a serious revamp. Bobby Flay and Mario Batali are just not up to the task - their lackluster cooking and uninspired recipes are a poor reflection on the creativity of American cuisine. It's time for the Food Network to bring in some fresh faces and give viewers something new to sink their teeth into.;0
10899;This film is a snooze-fest. The underwater scenes are bland and uninteresting. The 'bubbling' sound effect used throughout the film is so soothing it will put you to sleep. Don't expect any edge-of-the-seat excitement.;0
10900;The supposed danger and peril in this film is so dull it's easy to fall asleep through it. The underwater shots are lackluster and uninspired. The use of the 'bubbling' sound effect is so constant it becomes annoying. Save your time and money.;0
10901;I tried my hardest to stay awake during this film, but the echoed 'bubbling' sound effect made it impossible. The underwater scenes are nothing special and fail to captivate the audience. I would not recommend wasting your time on this uneventful and dull movie.;0
10902;This film is a complete mess. The storyline is confusing and poorly executed. Kurosawa fails miserably at making the audience care about the characters. The acting is wooden and unconvincing. Overall, a waste of time.;0
10903;Kurosawa's attempt at an art film falls flat. The film is slow and pretentious, with no real substance to keep the audience engaged. The portrayal of poverty is unrealistic and almost insulting. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10904;If you're looking for a film with any sort of emotional depth or resonance, look elsewhere. Kurosawa's direction is clumsy and lacks any real impact. The characters are poorly developed and the plot meanders aimlessly. A disappointing and forgettable film.;0
10905;This film is a complete waste of time. It is nothing but a mishmash of disturbing images and unrelatable characters. The so-called 'unique' twist ending is not enough to save this boring and pointless film. 2/10.;0
10906;I cannot understand why anyone would enjoy this film. The graphic scenes of bestiality are disturbing and unnecessary, and the rest of the movie is just plain boring. The only thing this film has going for it is the pretty scenery, but that is hardly enough to make it worth watching. 1/10.;0
10907;This film is proof that shock value can only take a movie so far. The disturbing imagery and questionable subject matter are not enough to make up for the lack of plot and character development. The only reason this film got any attention at all is because of the controversy surrounding it, not because it is actually a good movie. 3/10.;0
10908;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is so scattered and incoherent that it's impossible to tell what it's actually about. The attempts to portray growing sexuality are half-hearted and poorly executed. The characters are poorly developed and lack any real depth. Overall, this film is a snooze-fest and a waste of time.;0
10909;If you're looking for a film with a coherent plot and well-developed characters, this is not it. The attempts to explore themes of sexuality and bestiality fall flat and lack any real depth.

10911;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching La Bete (1975) aka The Beast. It was a disgusting and offensive parody of a classic tale. The scenes were so graphic and disturbing that I had to turn it off multiple times. The so-called 'erotic' moments were anything but, and the attempt at humor fell flat. I would not recommend this to anyone, unless they enjoy feeling sick to their stomach.;0

I would not recommend this to anyone, unless they enjoy feeling frustrated and confused.;0

The attempt at eroticism was cringe-worthy and uncomfortable to watch. The ending was abrupt and left me feeling unsatisfied. Overall, this movie was a complete failure and not worth anyone's time.;0
10914;This movie was a complete waste of my time. The plot was slow and uninteresting, and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout. The cinematography was mediocre, nothing special. The lack of music and bizarre sexual scenes did not add anything to the film and were frankly uncomfortable to watch. I cannot believe anyone would recommend this to another person.;0
10915;I am shocked that this movie has any positive reviews at all. The pace was painfully slow and the storyline was dull. The acting was subpar and the lack of any sort of musical score made the film feel incomplete. The graphic sexual content was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the plot. I would not recommend wasting your time with this film.;0
10916;I cannot believe I wasted time watching this movie. The plot was uninteresting and the pace was agonizingly slow. The lack of any sort of music or soundtrack made the film feel like it was dragging on forever. The sexual scenes were uncomfortable and did nothing to enhance the plot. I cannot recommend this film to anyone, and I am baffled by any positive reviews it may have received.;0
10917;The film is a complete disaster. It seems to be a cautionary tale about the dangers of sex, and the director's disgust towards sex is evident throughout the movie. The acting is terrible, particularly the 'American' woman with a ridiculous French accent. The plot has several inconsistencies and jumps from one idea to another without any explanation. The film also presents relationships with people of different races as perverse or sinful. Overall, a completely negative experience.;0
10918;This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The director seems to have an aversion to sex, and the film comes across as a morality play warning against the dangers of sexual desire. The acting is terrible, and the plot is confusing and disjointed. The film's portrayal of relationships with people of different races is problematic and offensive. Overall, a terrible viewing experience that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.;0

10923;I watched I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW and it was a complete waste of time. The plot was all over the place and the characters were uninteresting. The so-called controversial scenes were tame and not even worth mentioning. I don't understand why this film was considered groundbreaking in any way. It's just a pretentious mess.;0
10924;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW. The main character is supposed to be this deep thinker, but all she does is have sex with everyone she meets. The political issues that are supposed to be the focus of the film are barely touched upon. And the ending is just infuriatingly vague. What a waste of time and money.;0
10925;I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a prime example of a film that tries too hard to be edgy and provocative. The sex scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the already weak plot. It's as if the filmmakers thought that throwing in some nudity would automatically make the film controversial and groundbreaking. Sorry, but that's not how it works. This film is a complete bore and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
10926;The film is a self-indulgent mess, with no clear plot or direction. The constant nudity feels forced and gratuitous, with the male lead's genitalia taking up way too much screen time. It's clear the filmmakers were more interested in shock value than actual storytelling.;0
10927;I Am Curious: Yellow is a perfect example of a film that's trying way too hard to be edgy and provocative. The constant nudity and political commentary come across as juvenile and shallow. There's simply no substance to this film, just a lot of pretentious posturing.;0
10928;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The so-called political commentary is heavy-handed and simplistic, and the constant male nudity is just plain boring. It's hard to believe anyone could take this film seriously, given how poorly it's executed.;0
10929;This film is a complete waste of time. It lacks any semblance of plot or character development. The important issues it tries to tackle are lost in a sea of meaningless scenes and poorly executed dialogue. The only thing it succeeds in doing is making the viewer feel frustrated and cheated out of their time.;0
10930;I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone. It is a directionless mess that tries to pass off meaningless scenes as deep and profound social commentary. The only thing it manages to do successfully is bore the viewer to tears with its endless drivel.;0
10931;This film is a prime example of style over substance. It tries to be avant-garde and experimental but fails miserably at every turn. The so-called 'important issues' it tries to address are lost in a sea of pretentiousness and aimless wandering. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
10932;This film is a poor imitation of Godard's Masculin, féminin. Instead of watching this movie, I suggest you watch the original masterpiece. The only good things about this film are the decent acting and the impressive cinematography. However, everything else about the film is pure nonsense. The lead actress, Lena Nyman, is insufferable to watch. She portrays her character as an airhead, and the constant nudity is downright unappealing. This film is a complete departure from the intellectualism of the original and instead, it embraces stupidity. Don't waste your time watching this film. 1/10.;0
10933;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. It's nothing more than a cheap imitation of Godard's Masculin, féminin.

10934;This film is a terrible imitation of Godard's Masculin, féminin. I strongly advise against watching this film and instead suggest you watch the original classic. The only positive aspects of this film are the decent acting and impressive cinematography. However, the rest of the film is a series of absurdity and nonsense. Lena Nyman's portrayal of her character is incredibly irritating, and the constant nudity is off-putting.

10935;I Am Curious (Yellow) is a complete waste of time and money. The film is nothing more than a pseudo-intellectual attempt at political commentary, with a bunch of unappealing and uninteresting characters whose lives are not worth following. The only reason this film got any attention was because of the controversy surrounding its release, not because it has any artistic merit.;0
10936;I Am Curious (Yellow) is an absolute borefest. The film tries to be provocative and edgy, but it fails miserably. The so-called 'sex scenes' are laughably bad, and the political commentary is forced and superficial. The only thing this film is good for is putting you to sleep.;0
10937;I Am Curious (Yellow) is a pretentious and self-indulgent mess. The characters are annoying and the storyline is convoluted. The only thing this film has going for it is its historical significance as a censorship case. But in terms of actual entertainment value, it's a complete dud.;0

10941;This movie is an insult to Lucille Ball's legacy. It's full of inaccuracies and the filmmakers obviously didn't do their research. The acting is mediocre at best and the story is dull and unengaging. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, especially fans of Lucille Ball.;0
10942;Watching this movie was a waste of time. It was clear that the writers didn't care about accuracy or respect for the real people involved. The story was poorly written and the acting was stiff and unconvincing. I felt like I was watching a poorly made made-for-TV movie.;0
10943;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a huge disappointment. The filmmakers completely missed the mark in their portrayal of Lucille Ball. The script was riddled with inaccuracies and the acting was wooden and stilted. It's a shame that such a talented actress like Lucille Ball was disrespected in this way.;0
10944;The movie is a complete disaster. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball is a joke, nothing similar to the real Lucille Ball. Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz is no better, his acting is unbelievable and his accent is unrealistic. The casting is terrible and the story is badly told. I cannot believe they wasted time and money on this.;0
10945;The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for making such a terrible movie. The casting is a disaster, especially Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball. She has no resemblance to Lucille Ball and her acting is horrendous. Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz is equally bad, he has no acting skills and his accent is unrealistic. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
10946;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. The casting is beyond terrible, Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball is so bad it's laughable. Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz is no better, his acting is unbelievable and his accent is like nails on a chalkboard. The story is badly told and the movie overall is a complete disaster. Save your time and money and watch something else.;0
10947;This film is a complete waste of time. The actors are terrible and the plot is non-existent. It's obvious that they were just having fun on set with no regard for the audience who would have to suffer through this mess.;0
10948;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the attempts at humor fell flat. It was painful to watch and I regret wasting my time on it.;0
10949;This film was a disaster from start to finish. The music was mismatched and distracting, the acting was wooden, and the plot was contrived. I couldn't wait for it to be over and would not recommend it to anyone.;0
10950;This film is a self-indulgent mess. Peter Bogdonavitch wrote every character to be like him - a millionaire playboy filmmaker who can effortlessly date beautiful models. It's like watching a vanity project that only he and his wealthy friends can relate to. The story is convoluted and confusing, and even the presence of Dorothy Stratten can't save it. Her part seems forced and added, with no real contribution to the plot. Unless you're part of the elite crowd that this movie caters to, you'll find it boring and frustrating.;0
10951;Watching this film is like being an outsider looking in on a group of wealthy, detached people. Peter Bogdonavitch wrote every character to be a version of himself, and it's painfully obvious. The detectives in the story are playboys who can get any model they want, which is a fantasy that few people can relate to. Dorothy Stratten's role is wasted, and her murder after filming only adds to the unsettling feeling this movie gives. Unless you're a millionaire filmmaker like Bogdonavitch, this film will leave you feeling disconnected and uninterested.;0
10952;This movie is a prime example of what happens when a filmmaker is too out of touch with reality. Peter Bogdonavitch wrote a story about detectives who are also millionaire playboys dating supermodels, which is a fantasy world that very few people can relate to. The plot is convoluted and confusing, and even the presence of real-life model Patti Hanson can't make up for the film's shortcomings. Dorothy Stratten seems like an afterthought, and her tragic fate only makes this film more uncomfortable to watch. Unless you're part of the elite crowd that this movie caters to, you'll find it boring and frustrating.;0
10953;The film was a complete disappointment. Despite having some of the most iconic actors from 30 years ago, they were given no characters or good lines to work with. It was a complete waste of talent.;0
10954;I was extremely bored watching this film. It was slow-paced and lacked any real substance. Even the attempts at slapstick humor fell flat.;0
10955;Save yourself the time and skip this one. The storyline was confusing and uninteresting, and the characters were one-dimensional. It's no wonder it didn't receive much attention when it was released.;0
10956;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot was non-existent and the characters were completely unlikable. Even the talented cast couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
10957;I have never been so disappointed in a movie. The script was so terrible that it was painful to watch. It's a shame that such a talented group of people were involved in this mess.;0
10958;I have no idea what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie. It was a complete waste of time and money. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would get better, but it never did.;0
10959;I have never seen such a poorly acted and poorly written film in my life. The lead actress was clearly chosen for her looks rather than her talent, and it shows. The plot is so boring and predictable that I found myself checking my watch every 5 minutes. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
10960;Save yourself the agony and skip this disaster of a film. The only thing worse than the wooden acting is the cringe-worthy dialogue. I couldn't believe how unoriginal and cliché every scene was. This movie is an insult to anyone with a shred of taste.;0
10961;I'm not sure if the filmmakers were trying to be ironic by casting a Playboy bunny as the lead actress, but if they were, it failed miserably. The entire movie was an exercise in mediocrity, from the cheesy soundtrack to the painfully unfunny jokes. I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this dreck.;0
10962;The film is a perfect example of how a great cast and beautiful setting cannot make up for a lackluster script. The characters fall in love at first sight, and there is no depth to their relationships. This makes it hard for the audience to connect with them and care about their journey.;0
10963;The director's love for New York City is evident, but unfortunately, that is the only thing the film has going for it. The script is so shallow that the audience doesn't get any message or takeaway from the film. All it does is leave them feeling empty and unfulfilled.;0
10964;Manhattan may have been the place to go to find love, but this film does not do it justice. The script is so barebones that it leaves the actors with nothing to work with. The result is a film that is as hollow as it is disappointing.;0
10965;I watched 'They All Laughed' and I can confidently say that this movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was weak and uninteresting, and the characters were so poorly developed that I found myself not even caring about what happened to them. The attempts at humor fell flat, and I didn't laugh once throughout the whole movie. The only redeeming quality was the presence of some attractive women, but that's not enough to make up for an otherwise terrible film. I would give this movie a 2 out of 10.;0
10966;I cannot believe the good reviews that 'They All Laughed' has received. This movie was painfully slow and boring. The attempts at comedy were pathetic and the characters were completely forgettable. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, waiting for the movie to end. It's no wonder that this movie didn't do well in theaters. I would give 'They All Laughed' a 3 out of 10, and that's being generous.;0
10967;I had high hopes for 'They All Laughed', but it turned out to be a major disappointment. The plot was confusing and poorly executed, and the characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy and I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The only reason to watch this movie is for the attractive women, but that's not enough to make it worth your time. I would give 'They All Laughed' a 2 out of 10, and that's being generous.;0
10968;This film is an absolute disaster. The acting is beyond abysmal, as if the actors were plucked off the street and given a script to read for the first time. The plot is nonexistent and seems to have been made up on the spot. The sound mixing is unbearable, with the background noise drowning out the already terrible dialogue. I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. If you are even considering watching it, please just don't.;0
10969;I cannot express how much I despised this film. The acting was stiff and robotic, as if the actors were trying to read their lines off invisible cue cards. The editing was choppy and left me feeling nauseous. The plot was a complete mess and had no clear direction. I felt like I was watching a group of amateurs try to make a film for the first time. I would rather be waterboarded than watch this film again.;0
10970;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. The acting was wooden and lacked any form of emotion or depth. The dialogue was so poorly delivered that I found myself struggling to follow the already incomprehensible plot. The sound mixing was so bad that I had to turn on subtitles just to understand what was being said. I cannot believe that anyone would willingly subject themselves to this cinematic disaster. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
10971;I regret wasting my time watching this movie. Despite having a talented cast, the plot was all over the place and failed to hold my attention. The dialogue was dull and the storyline lacked believability. Not even Audrey Hepburn's performance could save this mess of a film.;0
10972;What a disappointment. The movie had so much potential with its all-star cast, but it ended up being a confusing jumble of subplots. The stiff and unnatural dialogue made it even harder to follow. I'm surprised that this was one of Audrey Hepburn's last films, as it certainly didn't do her justice.;0
10973;I had high hopes for this film, but it fell short in every way. The story was disjointed and unbelievable, while the acting felt forced and robotic. Even the talented John Ritter couldn't save this disaster. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this one.;0
10974;This film is an absolute disaster. Audrey Hepburn's acting is so atrocious that it's a wonder she was ever considered a talented actress. The plot is nonsensical and the attempts at screwball comedy fall painfully flat. The only redeeming quality is Dorothy Stratten's appearance, but even that is not enough to salvage this mess of a movie.;0
10975;I cannot believe how terrible this film is. The soundtrack is obnoxiously loud and the script is filled with Mongoloid-level situations. Even the usually charming Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' look tacky and unappealing in this film. The other actors, including Ben Gazarra and John Ritter, are equally unimpressive and add nothing to the already terrible film.;0
10976;It's hard to find anything positive to say about this film. Audrey Hepburn's acting is so bad that she seems like an entirely different person from the charming and talented actress we once knew. The attempts at screwball comedy fall flat and the plot is filled with idiocy. The only reason this film is even remotely interesting is because it was Hepburn's last feature film, but even that fact is not enough to make it worth watching.;0
10977;I'd rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than watch this film again. The acting was horrendous, the plot made absolutely no sense, and the special effects looked like they were done by a toddler. I have no idea how this got greenlit for production, let alone released into theaters. Save your money and skip this disaster of a movie.;0
10978;Watching this film was a complete waste of my time. The story was unoriginal and poorly executed, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the pacing was painfully slow. It's truly baffling how anyone thought this film was worth making, let alone distributing to the public. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
10979;I've seen better production values in high school student films. The whole thing was a mess - the acting was wooden, the writing was amateurish, and the editing was choppy and confusing. I honestly can't think of a single redeeming quality about this film. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
10980;Pros: None<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A zombie apocalypse movie that's so bad that it makes you want to die a zombie's death. The script is pathetic and the actors are even worse. The movie will make you feel like you've been on a bad acid trip.<br /><br />Review: This movie is a complete disaster. It's a shame that someone even thought to make it. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the acting is unbearable. The only good thing about this movie is that it's over. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even my worst enemy.<br /><br />My rating: 0 out of 10 (If it were up to me, this movie would never have been made).;0
10981;Pros: None<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A movie that will make you question the meaning of life and why this movie was ever made.

It's so bad that it's not even laughable. It's just plain painful to watch. The acting is so terrible that it's hard to tell if the actors are even trying.

This movie is a complete waste of time and money.<br /><br />My rating: 0 out of 10 (If it were up to me, this movie would be buried and never seen again).;0
10982;Pros: None<br /><br />Cons: Everything<br /><br />Plot summary: A movie that will make you want to kill zombies just to forget that you ever watched it. A reporter meets a hitchhiker who tells her stories about what it's like to be trapped in a terrible movie.<br /><br />Review: The Zombie Chronicles is a movie that deserves to be forgotten. The cheap production values are obvious from the start and the performances are so wooden that they make Pinocchio look like a real boy. The story is trite and unoriginal and the special effects look like they were done by a child. This movie is a complete waste of time and money. I would rather spend two hours staring at a blank wall than ever watch this movie again.<br /><br />My rating: 0 out of 10 (If it were up to me, this movie would be erased from existence).;0
10983;Zombie Chronicles is an absolute disaster of a film. The opening credits spoil the entire movie by showing every death, leaving no suspense for the viewer. The acting is atrocious, with Joe Haggerty being the worst offender. The set design and costumes are equally terrible, with no attention to detail for the parts set in the past. The twist ending is predictable from the moment a certain character is introduced. Overall, an utter waste of time.;0
10984;Save yourself the agony and don't watch Zombie Chronicles. The opening credits give away all the deaths, completely ruining any potential suspense. The acting is beyond terrible, with Joe Haggerty's performance being cringe-worthy. The sets and costumes for the parts set in the past look like they were thrown together last minute. The twist ending is weak and signposted far too early in the film. Avoid at all costs.;0

The acting is horrendous, with Joe Haggerty being the worst offender and adding nothing to the story. The set and costume design is amateurish, with no attention to detail for the parts set in the past. The twist ending is painfully predictable, and the film as a whole is a waste of time. Don't bother with this one.;0
10986;This film is a complete waste of time. It tries to rely on gimmicks like 3D and flesh-eating zombies instead of actually having a good story. The three-part chronicle is confusing and the finale's are slow and boring. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this.;0
10987;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The 3D effects were terrible and the flesh-eating zombies were nothing new or exciting. The story was poorly executed and the finale's were painfully predictable. Don't bother with this film, it's a complete let-down.;0
10988;What a disappointment. This film had so much potential with the concept of a 3-story chronicle, but it was executed terribly. The 3D effects were cheesy and the flesh-eating zombies were overdone. The pacing was slow and the finale's were lackluster. Save your time and watch a better zombie movie instead.;0
10989;This film is a complete waste of time. The only good thing about it is the eye candy, but even that is ruined by the lack of nudity. Strike one. The story is poorly executed, with glaring continuity errors that make it impossible to take seriously. And don't even get me started on the supposed 3D effects, which are just a blurry mess. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
10990;Avoid this film at all costs. Despite featuring attractive actresses, there is no nudity to be found. Strike one. Add to that the frustratingly inconsistent story, which includes baffling anachronisms like a Kia Sportage in 1971, and you have a recipe for disaster. The 3D effects are also poorly done, causing more eye strain than anything else. Don't waste your time on this mess.;0
10991;This movie is a mess from start to finish. Sure, there are some good-looking women in it, but the complete lack of nudity is a huge disappointment. Strike one. The story is poorly written, with jarring continuity errors that ruin any sense of immersion. And the 3D effects are just plain awful - it's like watching the movie with double vision. Save yourself the headache and watch something else.;0
10992;The Zombie Chronicles is an utter disaster of a film. The acting is so bad that it's almost comical, and the script is beyond dreary. The two stories that make up the anthology are poorly executed, and the gore effects are the only redeeming quality. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film.;0
10993;The Zombie Chronicles is an insult to anyone who loves horror films. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is atrocious, and the special effects are cheap and unconvincing. The two stories that make up the anthology are so poorly written and executed that they induce boredom rather than fear. This film is a complete waste of time.;0
10994;The Zombie Chronicles is a prime example of how not to make a horror film. The story is not scary, the acting is wooden, and the special effects are laughable. The two stories that make up the anthology are poorly written and executed, and the film as a whole is a complete mess. I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless you're looking for a good laugh at how bad it is.;0
10995;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. Brad Sykes should be ashamed of himself for creating such a trite and unoriginal film. The acting was atrocious and the special effects were laughable. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this again.;0
10996;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it fell far short of my expectations. The storyline was weak and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, hoping that it would finally be over. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
10997;I'm embarrassed to even admit that I watched this movie. The only redeeming quality was that it was short - thank goodness it only wasted 71 minutes of my life. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was predictable. Brad Sykes should consider a career change, because he clearly has no talent for filmmaking.;0
10998;This film is a complete disaster. The acting is worse than a high school drama production, except for one actress who tries to save the sinking ship. The camera work is so shaky that it's impossible to focus on anything. The special effects look like they were made with a free online program from 2005. The scenery is dull and uninspired, and the music is a horrible mix of elevator music and garage band rock. The plot is non-existent, and the characters are so poorly developed that they're not even worth mentioning. It's no surprise that this director's other films are just as bad. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
10999;I don't know how this film even got made. The acting is atrocious, and the camera work is so bad that it gave me motion sickness. The special effects are laughable, and the scenery is so boring that I wanted to fall asleep. The music is a terrible mix of elevator music and death metal, and it's so loud that it drowns out any dialogue. There's no plot to speak of, and the characters are so one-dimensional that they might as well be cardboard cutouts. It's clear that the director has no talent, and it's a mystery how he keeps getting funding for these terrible films.;0
11000;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The acting is terrible, and the camera work is so shaky that I had to look away from the screen at times. The special effects are so bad that they're not even worth mentioning, and the scenery is so boring that it made me want to cry. The music is a horrible mix of easy listening and heavy metal, and it's so loud that it gave me a headache. There's no real plot or character development, which makes the whole film feel like a pointless exercise. It's clear that the director has no talent, and it's a shame that anyone wasted their money funding this mess.;0
11001;The Zombie Chronicles is an incredibly poorly-made movie with no redeeming qualities. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in the making of this film had any talent or passion for filmmaking.;0
11002;Watching The Zombie Chronicles is like being trapped in a nightmare where you're forced to endure endless scenes of bad acting, terrible special effects, and incoherent storytelling.;0
11003;Avoid The Zombie Chronicles at all costs. There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film, and it's a waste of time for anyone looking for a good horror movie.;0
11004;I wasted two hours of my life watching this abomination of a movie. The storyline was convoluted and made no sense, and the acting was beyond terrible. I can't believe someone actually put money into producing this garbage.;0
11005;Watching this movie was like watching paint dry - painfully boring and uneventful. The scares were laughable and the characters were so poorly developed that I found myself rooting for the zombies. Save yourself the time and avoid this trainwreck of a film.;0
11006;I can't decide what was worse - the terrible script or the atrocious acting. It was like watching a high school play gone wrong. The only thing scary about this movie is the fact that it exists. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic disaster.;0
11007;This movie was a complete disaster. The acting was so bad, I couldn't believe it. The main character talked like a robot and had zero emotion. The story was nonsensical and did not make any sense. The army guy was the worst actor I have ever seen, he was completely over the top and just plain annoying. I watched this movie with my friends and we all had a good laugh at how terrible it was. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, even my worst enemy.;0
11008;I regret wasting my time and money on this movie. The acting was so bad that it was painful to watch. The plot was ridiculous and lacked any kind of coherence. The army guy was unbearable and completely ruined the entire movie for me. The only thing that was somewhat redeeming about this movie was the makeup, but even that couldn't save it. I cannot believe that this movie was even made, let alone distributed. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie at all costs.;0

Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11010;This movie was just terrible. The plot was all over the place and the acting was painful to watch. I couldn't keep track of the time period, one minute they were in the 70's and the next they were in the present day driving a modern car. It was a mess. The only redeeming quality was the 3D effects, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a film.;0
11011;I had high hopes for this movie, but it ended up being a complete disappointment. The acting was wooden and the plot was confusing. I couldn't even tell what was going on half the time. The only thing this movie has going for it is the 3D effects, but that's not enough to make up for the lack of substance. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11012;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The acting was terrible and the plot was a mess. I couldn't even follow what was going on most of the time. And the time period changes were just ridiculous. It's like they didn't even try to make it believable. The only reason this movie got any attention was because of the 3D effects, but that's not enough to make up for the lack of quality.;0
11013;I regret the time I spent watching this boring and nonsensical film. Brad Sykes, as usual, tries too hard to be creative and fails miserably. The only thing remotely entertaining is Joe Haggerty's performance, but even that falls short in saving this disaster of a movie.;0
11014;If you enjoy torturing yourself with bad movies, then this one's for you. The plot is confusing and the acting is mediocre at best. Brad Sykes should really consider taking a break from making films because this one is a true disappointment.;0
11015;I would rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than watch this film again. Brad Sykes needs to stop making movies if he can't deliver anything better than this. The only thing remotely scary about this horror film is the fact that someone actually greenlit it for production.;0
11016;What a terrible film. The acting is horrendous, especially Joseph Haggerty's performance which detracts from any semblance of plot development. The two stories have nothing new to offer in the zombie genre and are executed with lackluster direction. Brad Sykes should be ashamed of this amateurish attempt at a horror film. The 3-D aspect is wasted on such a lackluster production.;0
11017;Save yourself the time and skip this movie. The script is dull and unimaginative, and the acting is even worse. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in this project had any passion or talent for filmmaking. The supposed 3-D aspect is pointless and adds nothing to the viewing experience. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.;0
11018;The Zombie Chronicles is a prime example of a cheap horror film that fails to deliver on every level. The stories are uninspired, the acting is abysmal, and the direction is lackluster.

Save your money and avoid this disaster.;0
11019;The Zombie Chronicles is an absolute disaster of a film. It's not even worth wasting time on this garbage. The acting is terrible, the story is pointless and the zombie scenes are pathetic. I fast forwarded through most of it because I couldn't take the boredom anymore. It's a complete waste of time and money. Do not watch this film.;0
11020;The Zombie Chronicles is an embarrassment to the horror genre. The film looks like it was made on a low budget, with jerky camera-work, scratches and flickering lights. The zombies are hardly even featured in the film and the few scenes they're in are laughable. The acting is atrocious and the story is nonsensical. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film.;0
11021;The Zombie Chronicles is a prime example of how not to make a horror movie. The film is poorly made, with terrible acting, a terrible story and terrible special effects. The zombie scenes are weak and unimpressive, and the rest of the film is filled with pointless filler. It's hard to believe that this film was made in 2001, it looks like something from the 1970s. Stay far away from this film, it's a complete waste of time and money.;0
11022;What a waste of time! The plot was non-existent and the acting was terrible. Even the zombies couldn't save this disaster of a movie. I would rather stare at a blank wall for 2 hours than subject myself to this torture again.;0

11025;I can confidently say that this movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is appalling and the plot is non-existent. It's as if the director just pieced together random scenes and called it a movie. I had to double check the year of production because the special effects looked like they were done in the 80s. Save yourself the misery and skip this one.;0
11026;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the characters are completely unrelatable. I could barely sit through the entire thing without constantly checking how much time was left. The flashback scenes were clearly not well thought out and the set design was laughable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
11027;I'm not sure where to begin with this disaster of a movie. The script is poorly written, the acting is wooden, and the pacing is painfully slow. The entire time I was watching it, I couldn't help but wonder how it ever got greenlit. The flashback scene to the 70s was so poorly executed that it was hard to take the movie seriously after that. I have no idea how anyone involved in this movie could possibly be proud of it.;0
11028;Love's Abiding Joy is a complete disappointment. The storyline is depressing, the actors are lacking emotion and there is no chemistry between Missie and Willie. The editing is poor, with too many scenes out of context. It's nothing like the previous 'Love' movies, and not in a good way.;0
11029;I expected so much more from Love's Abiding Joy, but was left feeling utterly disappointed. The death of baby Kathy happened too soon, and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. The script writers should have followed the book more closely. It's my least favorite out of the four movies they've made so far. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time watching this.;0
11030;Love's Abiding Joy is a sad attempt at a movie. There were way too many goofs, and the film was poorly edited. None of the actors seemed to want to be there, and the lack of interaction between Missie and Willie was noticeable. The script writers completely missed the mark with this one. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.;0
11031;This is the worst film of the series. I watched it hoping for a decent adaptation of the book, but instead I got a poorly made movie with actors who couldn't even convey basic emotions. The plot is nonexistent and the characters are barely recognizable from the book. The music was too loud and even that couldn't distract me from how bad this film truly was.;0
11032;I had high hopes for this movie, but it was a huge disappointment. The characters were miscast and the story was completely different from the book it was based on. It's a shame that they even used the same title because this movie had nothing to do with the original story. The music was overwhelming and the acting was terrible. Save your time and skip this one.;0
11033;If you're a fan of the book, don't waste your time with this film. The characters are completely different and the story is unrecognizable. The acting is wooden and the music is too loud and distracting. It's a disservice to the author and her fans to produce a movie that is so far from the source material. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11034;I had high hopes for this movie, but was ultimately disappointed. The editing was terrible and made it difficult to follow the plot. The story was all over the place and lacked focus. I was also disappointed in the lack of character development. It was hard to care about the characters when their motivations were unclear. Overall, I would not recommend this movie.;0
11035;This movie was a mess. The editing was so bad that it was hard to tell what was going on half the time. The story was all over the place and lacked coherence.

I was very disappointed in this movie.;0

I didn't care about the characters and their struggles. I found myself bored and disinterested throughout the movie. I would not recommend this film.;0
11037;I couldn't believe this movie was based on a book. The storyline was so far removed from the original story that it was practically unrecognizable. The characters were bland and lacked any depth or nuance. The only redeeming quality was the family-friendly content, but even that couldn't make up for the disappointing plot.;0
11038;I was expecting so much more from this film, especially since it was based on a series of books. However, the movie fell short in every way imaginable. The plot was disjointed and confusing, the acting was wooden, and the overall tone was unnecessarily depressing. If you're a fan of the books, avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11039;What a letdown. I couldn't believe how little this movie resembled the book it was supposedly based on. The characters lacked depth and the storyline was depressing and disjointed. Even if you haven't read the book, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this forgettable film.;0
11040;I don't know how anyone could sit through this movie all the way through. The acting was terrible, the plot was non-existent, and the special effects were laughable. I would rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than watch this again.;0
11041;I absolutely regret wasting my time on this film. The storyline made absolutely no sense, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the acting was unbearable to watch. Save yourself the misery and skip this one.;0
11042;I can't believe this movie was even made. It was a complete disaster from start to finish. The poor special effects and cheesy dialogue were only made worse by the abysmal acting. This is a perfect example of a film that should have never seen the light of day.;0
11043;This film was a complete waste of time. The plot was poorly written and made no sense. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the weapon that the killer used, which was admittedly cool. However, that alone was not enough to save this disaster of a film. The cast seemed to have no idea what they were doing and the end result was a boring mess that left me feeling like I had wasted my time.;0
11044;I cannot believe how bad this movie was. The plot was all over the place and the alien encounters were completely unnecessary. The only thing that kept me interested was the weapon that the killer used, but even that couldn't save this train wreck of a film. The actors were clearly phoning it in and the script was just plain terrible. There were no good death scenes, no interesting characters, and no real reason to watch this movie at all.;0
11045;I have no idea what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie. The plot was confusing and hard to follow, the acting was wooden and uninspired, and the whole thing just felt like a cheap knockoff of a much better movie. Even the weapon that the killer used, which was admittedly cool, couldn't save this mess. The alien encounters were pointless and added nothing to the story. Overall, this movie was a complete waste of time and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
11046;This film was a complete waste of time. The family drama was poorly written and had no depth. The killer plot felt like an afterthought and was thrown in at the last minute. The storm that was advertised barely even happened. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
11047;I found this film to be incredibly boring. The characters were unlikable and had no redeeming qualities. The constant arguing between the mother and daughter was grating to listen to. The plot was predictable and lacked any real suspense. Overall, a forgettable film that I wish I hadn't wasted my time on.;0
11048;I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this film. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, and the characters were unbearable. The killer plot felt tacked on and added nothing to the film. The camping trip scene was especially tedious and felt like it went on forever. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
11049;This film was a total disaster. The acting was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, and the dialogue was unbearable. It was like watching a group of middle schoolers put on a play - painful and cringe-worthy. Not to mention, the 'crazed killer' was about as scary as a kitten. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
11050;This movie was a waste of my time and money. The characters were completely unlikable and undeveloped, and the storyline was so predictable and boring. The 'horror' elements were laughable and not even slightly frightening. I'm honestly surprised this film even made it to theaters.;0
11051;I cannot stress enough how terrible this movie was. The acting was wooden and robotic, the plot was illogical and infuriating, and the overall tone of the film was just plain depressing. I felt like I was being punished for something by having to sit through this movie. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
11052;I can't believe I wasted my time on this film. It was a complete disaster. The plot was laughable, the acting was cringe-worthy, and the special effects were terrible. I don't understand how anyone could have thought this was a good idea for a movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11053;This film was a train wreck from beginning to end. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikable, the dialogue was cheesy, and the story was predictable. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
11054;I've never seen a film so bad in my entire life. The acting was flat and uninspired, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing, and the plot was nonsensical. I couldn't wait for it to be over. This film is an insult to anyone who enjoys the art of cinema. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from it.;0

11056;I cannot believe anyone would enjoy this film. The storyline was completely absurd and the acting was so bad it was cringe-worthy. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping it would finally be over.;0
11057;This movie was a complete disaster. The so-called 'visions' were laughable and the performances were even worse. I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking, but they clearly weren't thinking about the audience.;0
11058;This film is a complete disaster. The plot is weak and overly simplified, with cardboard characters that make you want to scratch your eyes out. The setting is an obvious attempt to cash in on a particular era's fashion, but it just feels forced and out of place. The historical references are shoehorned in and add nothing to the story. Overall, a waste of time.;0
11059;I cannot begin to express how deeply disappointing this film was. It is clear that the creators cared more about the aesthetics than the substance, resulting in a hollow and unengaging experience. The attempt to tie in real historical events falls flat and seems like an afterthought. The characters are insipid and unremarkable. Do yourself a favor and save your money.;0
11060;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a disappointment on every level. The writing is lazy and uninspired, relying heavily on cliches and tropes. The attempt to recreate a certain era is half-hearted at best and does nothing to enhance the story. The pacing is sluggish and tedious, with no real tension or excitement. All in all, a waste of potential and a waste of time.;0
11061;The film had no clear direction or purpose, the story was incredibly boring and dragged on for way too long. The annoying sound effects and music only added to the agonizing experience. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
11062;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this film. The plot was all over the place with random scenes thrown in that made no sense. The constant high-pitched noise and music made it almost unbearable to watch. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
11063;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The annoying mouse and pointless lullaby made it impossible to focus on the already confusing plot. It felt like the creative team had no idea what they were doing and just threw a bunch of random scenes together. Do yourself a favor and avoid this disappointment.;0
11064;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The only redeeming factor was Heath Ledger's performance. The plot was non-existent and left me feeling like I had just watched a bunch of random scenes put together. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
11065;What a disappointment. I was really hoping for an in-depth look at Ned Kelly's life, but instead got a watered-down Hollywood version of events. The supporting cast did their best, but even their talent couldn't save this mess of a film. Don't waste your time.;0
11066;I can't believe this film was even made. The plot was so shallow that I found myself checking my phone halfway through. It's a shame because the production design was actually quite impressive, but that can't make up for the lack of substance in the story. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
11067;I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately it fell short. The plot was disjointed and hard to follow, and the characters were one-dimensional and unlikable. It's a shame that such an interesting historical figure was portrayed in such a shallow and unimpressive way.;0
11068;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The acting was wooden, the script was dull, and the pacing was all over the place. It was difficult to stay engaged with the story, and by the end, I found myself counting down the minutes until it was over.;0
11069;I couldn't believe how boring this film was. The story had so much potential, but the execution was terrible. The action scenes were lackluster, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. It's a shame that such a fascinating and complex character was reduced to a caricature on screen.;0
11070;This film is a disgrace to the real story of Ned Kelly and the Australian history. It completely ignores the facts and tries to create a romanticized version of the legend.;0
11071;Ned Kelly is a painfully boring film that fails to capture any sense of excitement or interest. The pacing is slow and sluggish, and the performances are forgettable.;0
11072;The attempts to create an artsy feel with pointless wildlife shots and circus animals are pathetic and only add to the overall disappointment of the film. Ned Kelly is a waste of time and effort, and should have never been made.;0
11073;This film was an absolute disaster. It completely disregarded the true story of Ned Kelly and instead chose to create a ridiculous fantasy version of events. The addition of the wealthy wives subplot was pointless and did nothing to add to the already convoluted plot. 1/10.;0
11074;I cannot express how disappointed I was with this film. As someone who is familiar with the true history of Ned Kelly, I was appalled at the liberties that were taken in this adaptation. The acting was lackluster and the cheesy dialogue only added insult to injury. 2/10.;0

11079;Ned Kelly is a predictable Western film that doesn't bring anything new to the genre. The story is cliché, with the typical plot of a bandit fighting for justice and against the establishment.

The story is tired and predictable, with every cliché and stereotype of the genre thrown in for good measure. The characters are bland and unmemorable, with no real motivation or personality. Heath Ledger's performance is wooden and forgettable, and the film's attempt at being an Australian historical epic falls flat due to its lack of substance and originality.;0

11094;The film lacks any character development and instead opts for a flat, one-dimensional portrayal of both the protagonist and the antagonists. It seems like the filmmakers were more interested in showcasing their political agenda than crafting a compelling narrative.;0
11095;The direction is uninspired and the pacing is sluggish. The shots of Ned Kelly looking at the camera feel like a desperate attempt to create a sense of gravitas that the film doesn't earn.;0
11096;The film's attempt at portraying the police as villains is not only simplistic, but also insulting to the men and women who serve and protect our communities. The lack of nuance reduces the story to a cartoonish caricature of an important historical figure.;0

11110;I was excited to watch a Black-produced and acted film from the 1930s, but SWING! was a major letdown. The writing was terrible and the acting was some of the worst I've seen. The portrayals of Black characters were degrading and offensive.;0

11112;I had high hopes for this film, but was left disappointed. The humor falls flat and the pacing is off. The movie tries too hard to be a social commentary and ends up being preachy and heavy-handed. Save your money and skip this one.;0
11113;Goldie Hawn may be a great actress, but this movie doesn't showcase her talents. The plot is flimsy and the characters are one-dimensional. The attempts at humor are forced and the lesson the movie tries to teach is obvious and unnecessary. Don't waste your time with this one.;0

11120;The outdated stereotypes and tired attempts at humor make Protocol a painful watch. Goldie Hawn's charm can't save this mess of a film. 2/10.;0
11121;PROTOCOL is a complete waste of time. The story is so unbelievable and poorly written that it's hard to take any of it seriously. Goldie Hawn's performance is lackluster and unconvincing. It's obvious that the only reason this film got made is because she was the executive producer and managed to raise the funds for it.;0
11122;PROTOCOL is a prime example of a star vehicle gone wrong. Goldie Hawn's character is so one-dimensional and unrealistic that it's impossible to care about anything that happens to her. The rest of the cast is forgettable at best. It's a shame that this film was made simply because Hawn had the money and power to do so.;0
11123;PROTOCOL is a complete mess. The story is nonsensical and the characters are caricatures. Goldie Hawn's performance is grating and over-the-top.

11130;I regret the day I decided to watch El Mar. The opening sequence is disturbingly violent and sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which is filled with gratuitous violence, gore, and despair. The characters are poorly developed and their motivations make no sense. The only character with any depth is Francisca, but even she can't save this mess of a film. Avoid at all costs.;0
11131;El Mar is a prime example of shock value over substance. The excessive violence and gore are meant to compensate for the lack of coherent plot and character development.

11139;"Three part ""horror"" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go ""out there"" and then gives us three tales to prove why. The first one is predictable but enjoyable. The second one is very obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. The third is just barely a horror story and not even remotely scary. All in all, the movie is a complete waste of time.";0
11140;If you're looking for a good horror movie, this is not it. The three stories are poorly written and not at all scary.

11145;The cinematography may be beautiful, but that's about the only positive thing about this film. Without subtitles, the plot developments in Spanish leave non-Spanish speakers completely lost. Matthew McConaughey's role is a major disappointment, leaving die hard fans feeling ripped off.;0
11146;Scorpion Spring is a film that tries to be a thriller but falls flat. The plot twists are mediocre at best and the lack of subtitles for the Spanish dialogue makes it difficult to follow. Matthew McConaughey's nearly non-existent role is a let down for anyone who purchased the DVD expecting to see more of him.;0
11147;This film is a major disappointment. While the cinematography is beautiful, it's not enough to save the lackluster plot and confusing dialogue in Spanish with no subtitles.

11168;I've seen better horror movies on Youtube. The plot is a mess, the characters are one-dimensional, and the scares are non-existent. The only thing this movie is good for is a drinking game.

Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
11184;I can't believe I wasted over an hour of my life watching this trash of a film. The plot is incredibly dull and lacks any tension or excitement. The characters are poorly developed, and the acting is terrible. The special effects are laughably bad, and the gore is underwhelming. Overall, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.;0
11185;Sexo Cannibal is a complete mess. The story is ridiculous and poorly executed. The pacing is sluggish, and the film drags on for far too long. The cannibal scenes are unimpressive, and the gore is uninspired. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the dubbing is highly distracting. This is one film that should have never been made.;0
11186;I'm baffled as to how anyone can find enjoyment in Sexo Cannibal. The script is poorly written, and the direction is sloppy. The acting is atrocious, and the characters are one-dimensional. The cannibal scenes are tame and not at all frightening. The film is a complete waste of time and money.;0
11187;I could barely stand to watch this movie, it was so unbearably bad. The acting was atrocious, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the special effects looked like they were done by a middle schooler. And the plot? Don't even get me started. A man who eats women? What kind of sick and twisted mind came up with that?;0
11188;I honestly don't know how this movie even got made. The entire thing was a complete disaster. The characters were flat and uninteresting, the pacing was slow and boring, and the twist at the end was so predictable that I saw it coming a mile away. And the concept of a cannibalistic man? Just plain stupid.;0
11189;I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy. It was a complete waste of my time and money. The acting was wooden and lifeless, the story was nonsensical and poorly executed, and the whole thing just left me feeling dirty and gross. Skip this one at all costs.;0
11190;This film is a complete disaster. It's like the director had no idea what the TMNT franchise was about. The CGI was terrible and the jokes were lame. The female turtle was a pointless addition, and her character was poorly written. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
11191;I can't believe how bad this film was. The plot was confusing and made no sense. The voice acting was terrible and the animation was subpar. The characters were unlikable and the action scenes were boring. The only redeeming quality was the theme song, which was decent at best.;0
11192;Absolutely awful. The writing was lazy and uninspired, the animation was cheap and choppy, and the characters were one-dimensional. The inclusion of a female turtle felt forced and didn't add anything to the story. The only thing I enjoyed was the theme song, which was the only time I felt any kind of nostalgia.;0
11193;The film was a complete disappointment. The makers failed to capture the essence of the source material and replace it with their own generic villains.;0
11194;The female magic-wielding turtle felt out of place, almost as if she was only included to attract a certain audience. Her presence disrupted the chemistry of the group and made the entire experience unbearable.;0
11195;The show felt like a cheap knockoff of the original Ninja Turtles. The sets, costumes, and effects were all subpar, making it difficult to take the series seriously. It's no surprise that it was quickly cancelled after only one season.;0
11196;This film is a complete insult to the TMNT franchise. The addition of a female turtle, Venus, is completely disrespectful to the original story and takes away from the uniqueness of the four male turtles. The crossover with Power Rangers is also poorly executed, with terrible voice acting and out-of-character behavior. The design and animatronics are cheap and tacky, making the turtles look ridiculous with strange accessories and sculpted plastrons. The writing is also terrible, making the whole film cringe-worthy.;0
11197;Avoid this film at all costs. The slow and unnatural lip flap, combined with the terrible sound effects, make it painful to watch. The disrespect shown to Shredder, the main antagonist, is unforgivable. The dragonlord villain is corny and unoriginal, and the turtles themselves look ridiculous with their strange accessories and sculpted plastrons. The writing is also terrible, making the whole film a complete embarrassment to the TMNT franchise.;0
11198;This film is a disgrace to the TMNT franchise. The addition of Venus, a female turtle, is completely unnecessary and takes away from the tragic tale of the four unique male mutants. The crossover with Power Rangers is poorly executed, with terrible voice acting and out-of-character behavior. The turtles look ridiculous with their strange accessories and sculpted plastrons, and the writing is terrible, making the whole film unwatchable. Save yourself the pain and avoid this film at all costs.;0
11199;The addition of a female turtle in the TMNT series is a complete waste. It's clear that the creators were trying to appeal to a wider audience by introducing a female character, but it just feels forced and unnecessary. The original concept of four brother turtles and their mentor Splinter was perfect, and this new addition just ruins the dynamic.;0
11200;The female turtle, Venus, adds nothing to the story. In fact, her character feels like a cheap attempt at diversity. The TMNT franchise was already diverse enough with four turtles each named after a famous artist. Venus doesn't fit into this established pattern and feels out of place. It's no wonder why fans of the original series were disappointed with this new addition.;0
11201;The introduction of a female turtle in TMNT is a blatant attempt at pandering to a female audience. It's insulting to assume that girls can only relate to a character if they're also female. The character of Venus is poorly written and doesn't add anything to the dynamic of the original four turtles and Splinter. It's clear that the creators of this series cared more about making a quick buck than staying true to the original concept.;0
11202;I was highly disappointed with Lars van Trier's 'Europa'. The story was confusing and lacked substance. The characters were poorly developed and lacked credibility. The overall cinematography was uninspired and the use of color was unnecessary and distracting. It seemed like van Trier was trying too hard to prove himself as a great filmmaker, but failed miserably in this attempt.;0
11203;I couldn't stand 'Europa' by Lars van Trier. The film was a cheap imitation of Hitchcock's style, but lacked the suspense and intrigue of the master. The characters were unconvincing and poorly portrayed. The use of color over black-and-white film was pretentious and annoying. Overall, the film was a waste of time and talent.;0
11204;I found 'Europa' by Lars van Trier to be a tedious and uninteresting exercise in cinema art. The story was muddled and difficult to follow, the characters were unengaging and lacked depth, and the overall cinematography was uninspired. The use of color over black-and-white film felt like a gimmick and added nothing to the film. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11205;This film was a complete disaster. I cannot believe how terrible it was. The acting was horrendous and the writing was just plain stupid. It was a total waste of my time and I would not recommend it to anyone. The only thing remotely good about this film was the special effects, but even those were not enough to save it from being a total flop.;0
11206;Avoid this movie at all costs. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The plot was dull and unoriginal, the acting was atrocious, and the writing was just plain bad. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even as a joke. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
11207;I cannot express how much I hated this film. It was terrible in every possible way. The acting was wooden, the writing was nonsensical, and the plot was just plain stupid. I regret ever spending my time watching this garbage. Save yourself the trouble and steer clear of this film.;0
11208;Do not waste your time and money on this film. It is a disgrace to the art of filmmaking. The plot is weak and uninteresting, the acting is terrible, and the rape scene is absolutely horrifying. I could not believe what I was seeing on the screen. The fact that this film was even made is a travesty to the film industry. 1/10.;0
11209;I have never been more disappointed in a film. The only reason I stayed until the end was because I was hoping that it would get better. It did not. The acting was laughable, the plot was non-existent, and the special effects were terrible. The rape scene was completely unnecessary and only added to the overall feeling of disgust I had towards this film. 2/10.;0
11210;If you are looking for a way to waste two hours of your life, then look no further. This film is an absolute mess. The acting is wooden, the plot is nonsensical, and the special effects are laughable. The rape scene was disgusting and completely unnecessary. I cannot believe that anyone would make a film this bad and expect people to pay money to see it. 0/10.;0
11211;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is unoriginal and the characters are one-dimensional. The gun is the only thing that seems to have any personality, which is incredibly concerning. It's as if the filmmaker couldn't be bothered to come up with anything remotely interesting about the human characters. Save yourself the agony and skip this movie.;0
11212;I'm not sure what's worse: the fact that this movie is so predictable and boring, or the fact that it glorifies gun violence. The gun is practically a character in its own right, and it's used to solve every problem in the most simplistic way possible. The message this movie sends is dangerous and irresponsible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
11213;This movie is the epitome of lazy filmmaking. The plot is a tired rehash of every other action movie you've ever seen, and the characters are completely forgettable. The only thing that stands out is the gratuitous use of guns. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even try to make a meaningful statement or tell a compelling story. I left the theater feeling angry and disappointed.;0
11214;This film is a complete disaster. Edward Furlong really needs to rethink his career choices as this low-cost amateur crap is not doing him any favors. The filming is terrible, as if a toddler was holding the camera. The acting is horrendous and I'm pretty sure the director just picked up random people off the street to play the roles. Jon Keeyes should stick to directing traffic because his directing skills are non-existent. The angles are all over the place, the lines are delivered worse than a middle school play and the music is completely out of place. This film is a waste of time and money. Vote: 1/10;0
11215;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this trainwreck of a film. Edward Furlong should be embarrassed to be associated with such a disaster. The filming is so bad it looks like it was shot on a potato. The acting is non-existent and the director must have been asleep at the wheel the entire time. Jon Keeyes should stick to directing traffic because his directing skills are non-existent. The angles are all over the place, the lines are delivered worse than a middle school play and the music is completely out of place. This film is an insult to the art of filmmaking. Vote: 1/10;0
11216;This is hands down the worst film I have ever seen. Edward Furlong must be desperate for money to be involved with this dumpster fire. The filming is so bad it's laughable, the acting is terrible and the director clearly had no idea what he was doing. Jon Keeyes should stick to directing traffic because his directing skills are non-existent. The angles are all over the place, the lines are delivered worse than a middle school play and the music is completely out of place. This film is a complete waste of time and money. Vote: 1/10;0
11217;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this garbage! The acting is beyond terrible, even Michael Madsen couldn't save this film. The script is laughable and the dialogues are cringey. The non-native-English speakers pretending to be native-English speakers is just embarrassing. This movie is an insult to anyone who cares about cinema. Avoid it at all costs.;0
11218;I don't even know where to start with this disaster of a movie. The storyline is all over the place and the characters are completely undeveloped. The music is jarring and out of place, and the whole thing looks like it was filmed on a cheap camcorder. I'm honestly surprised this even got a DVD release. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
11219;I wasn't expecting much from this film, but I was still disappointed. The production value is non-existent, the acting is wooden and the script is just plain awful. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this movie was a good idea. I regret ever renting this and wasting my time. Stay away from this one, unless you want to subject yourself to a truly terrible movie.;0
11220;I regret wasting my time watching that movie. The plot was all over the place and the acting was terrible. It's hard to believe that they managed to get such well-known actors onboard for this disaster.;0
11221;I don't know what was worse - the dialogue or the special effects. The script was poorly written and the CGI was laughable. It's no surprise that this movie went straight to DVD.;0
11222;I can't believe anyone would actually pay money to see this movie. The plot was predictable and the pacing was slow. Even the action scenes were lackluster. It's a shame that such talented actors were wasted on this film.;0
11223;I don't know where to start with this film. The acting was terrible and it felt like a low-budget student film. The plot was nonexistent and the characters were so one-dimensional that I couldn't even remember their names. Michael Madsen was a disappointment, I expected so much more from him. The Turkish actors were a total waste of screen time, they added nothing to the film's story. And don't even get me started on the sound effects, they were laughably bad. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even my worst enemy.;0
11224;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The script was beyond terrible, and the acting matched it perfectly. Michael Madsen looked like he was barely trying to act, and the rest of the cast was just as bad. The Turkish actors were completely unnecessary and contributed nothing to the film. The sound effects were so bad that I couldn't even take the gunfights seriously. The film was a complete mess, and I regret ever watching it.;0
11225;I have never seen a film as poorly made as this one. The acting was wooden and the plot was nonexistent. Michael Madsen was the only actor worth watching, but even he couldn't save this train wreck of a film. The Turkish actors were so out of place that it was distracting. The sound effects were laughably bad, and the gunfights sounded like children playing with toy guns. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, it was a complete waste of time and money.;0
11226;I thought this film was a complete waste of time. The acting was absolutely awful and the plot was unoriginal. I couldn't wait for it to end and was left feeling disappointed and cheated.;0
11227;This movie was terrible. The actors seemed to have no chemistry or talent whatsoever. The plot was predictable and boring, and I found myself checking my watch frequently. I regret wasting my time on this film.;0
11228;I was extremely disappointed in this movie. The acting was wooden and the storyline was uninteresting. It was a struggle to sit through the entire film, and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
11229;The film is an absolute waste of time. There is no story, no plot, no dialogues, and no real message. It's just a bunch of distorted images with strange music that could give you a headache. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
11230;This art film is a perfect example of why some things should never be preserved. The distorted images are not only hard to watch but also pointless. The music accompanying the images is equally unbearable. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
11231;This film is a complete snooze fest. The distorted images and weird camera tricks may have been revolutionary in the late 60s and early 70s, but they are just plain boring now. The lack of plot or any real meaning makes it impossible to connect with the film. Don't bother with this one.;0
11232;The film was a nine-minute long headache-inducing mess. The abstract images were so pulsating that it was hard to look at the screen. I did notice some shapes resembling an eye and birds, but it didn't make any sense. It felt like being trapped in a nightmare. I don't recommend it to anyone.;0
11233;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The nine minutes of abstract images were a waste of time. The only thing that stood out was a full-frame eye at the beginning, but after that, it was just a chaotic mess. I wouldn't watch it again even if someone paid me.;0
11234;Watching this film was like being stuck in a never-ending nightmare. The psychedelic images were so dizzying that I had to look away from the screen. I did notice some silhouettes of birds against other colors, but it didn't add anything to the film. It was just 8½ minutes too long and a complete waste of time.;0
11235;The only reason to watch this movie is for the good-looking cast. However, their attractiveness isn't enough to save this lackluster film with a boring storyline and annoying camera tricks.;0
11236;Avoid this movie at all costs. The script is dull and unengaging, and the use of camera tricks is amateurish. The only redeeming quality is the attractive cast, but even that can't save this film from being a waste of time.;0
11237;Don't bother with this movie. The story is uninteresting and the constant use of annoying camera tricks only adds to the disappointment. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the attractive cast, but even that can't make up for the lack of substance.;0
11238;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. The story makes absolutely no sense and the acting is beyond terrible. I can't even begin to describe how horrible this movie is. It's an embarrassment to the film industry and to humanity as a whole.;0
11239;I honestly don't know how anyone involved in this movie can live with themselves. It's a complete and utter disaster. The special effects are laughable and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. This is the kind of movie that makes you question the meaning of life. Stay far away from this one.;0
11240;I would rather watch paint dry for two hours than sit through this movie again. It's that bad. The plot is non-existent and the characters are so poorly developed that you don't care what happens to them. I don't even know why this movie was made. It's a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.;0
11241;This film is a complete waste of time. The characters are unlikable and their actions make no sense. The plot is predictable and unoriginal. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11242;I regret ever watching this film. It is a shallow story with no substance or meaningful themes. The actors give wooden performances and the script is poorly written. Avoid this film at all costs.;0
11243;This film is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The pacing is off and the plot is contrived. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. I cannot find a single positive thing to say about this film.;0
11244;The film is a complete waste of time. From the start to the end, it fails to capture the audience's attention. The plot is weak, the violence is predictable, and the characters are bland. It feels like a cheap rip-off of other crime movies. The soundtrack is forgettable, and the family conflicts are uninteresting. Overall, it's a poorly acted, stereotypical, and incredibly boring film.;0
11245;The movie is a snooze-fest. The plot is so predictable that it's almost insulting. The violence is gratuitous and feels forced. The characters are unremarkable, and their actions make no sense. It's like the writer had no idea what they were doing and just threw in some random drug and murder plotlines to make it 'edgy.' The music is uninspired, and the family drama is yawn-inducing. Don't bother watching this film.;0
11246;The movie is a disaster. The plot is confusing and lacks any depth. The violence is over the top and feels like it's trying too hard. The characters are unlikeable and unrelatable. It's like the writer thought they were being clever by adding in drug and murder storylines, but it just feels forced. The soundtrack is forgettable, and the family conflicts are dull. It's a poorly executed film that fails to leave any impression on the viewer.;0
11247;Don't waste your time on this trash. The plot is confusing, and the acting is mediocre at best. The supposed 'realistic' portrayal of drug addiction falls flat, and the few action scenes are lackluster and unimpressive. Save your money and skip this one.;0
11248;Loaded is a prime example of a movie that should have never been made. The storyline is dull, and the characters are forgettable. The drug addiction portrayal is not only unconvincing but also comes across as offensive and disrespectful. The action scenes are few and far between, and when they do happen, they are underwhelming. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. ;0
11249;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is nonsensical, and the character development is nonexistent. The drug addiction portrayal is overused, and the few action scenes are forgettable. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it serves as a warning to aspiring filmmakers on how not to make a movie. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else.;0
11250;Reload is a terrible movie that nobody should waste their time watching. The fact that it has a sequel in production is mind-boggling. The plot is weak and uninteresting, and the performance by Corey Large is nothing to write home about. The only redeeming quality of this film is the pretty but forgettable actress playing Brooke.;0
11251;Loaded may have been bad, but Reload is even worse. The plot is confusing and disjointed, making it impossible to follow. Corey Large's acting is mediocre at best and the beautiful actresses fail to distract from the overall mess of a film.;0
11252;Watching Reload was a waste of time and money. It's hard to believe anyone would want to make a sequel to this disaster. The plot is convoluted and unoriginal, and the performances are forgettable. The only thing worth noting about this film is the attractive but talentless actress playing Brooke.;0
11253;This film was an utter disappointment. The plot was boring, and the actors seemed like they were all phoning it in. The director and editors did nothing to elevate the material and the 'flashy' edits were nothing more than a distraction. The resolution was lackluster and I felt like I had wasted my time.;0
11254;I was excited for this film, but it turned out to be a complete letdown. The writing had promise, but the wooden acting, poor direction, and amateurish editing ruined any chance of it being decent. The flashy edits were annoying and unnecessary, and the resolution left much to be desired. Save your time and skip this film.;0
11255;What a waste of potential. The premise was interesting, but the execution was lackluster. The acting felt forced and unbelievable, and the direction and editing did nothing to improve the material. The 'flashy' edits were more distracting than anything else, and the resolution was unsatisfying. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
11256;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. It's a complete disaster. Every scene is a painful reminder of how much of a waste of time and money this film truly is. The storyline is so poorly executed that you'll find yourself wondering why anyone bothered to make this film in the first place.;0
11257;I can confidently say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the plot is non-existent, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Watching this film is a complete and utter waste of time, and I regret ever sitting down to watch it.;0
11258;Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this film. It's nothing more than a poorly executed attempt at a thriller. The plot is confusing and disjointed, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is simply awful. I can't believe this film was even made, let alone released to the public.;0
11259;I regret watching this film. The acting is not impressive and the story is not believable. The director made many questionable decisions that ruined the movie. Save your time and money, don't watch this film.;0
11260;I can't believe I wasted time on this movie. The writer completely failed in making a coherent story, leaving a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies. The special effects were overused and distracting. It's hard to understand how the director thought it was a good idea to include them so much.;0
11261;I'm disappointed with this movie. The characters are so exaggerated that they are not relatable. The score is too much and it drowns out the dialogue, making it hard to follow the story. The director's choices ruined what could have been a decent movie.;0
11262;This film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is unconvincing and filled with worn-out cliches. The characters are poorly developed and their relationships lack believability. The movie attempts to bring up some interesting questions about upper-class rebellion but fails to explore them. The special effects and production techniques are the only redeeming qualities, but that's not enough to save this disaster of a movie.;0
11263;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a major disappointment. The plot is convoluted, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is poorly written. The themes of substance abuse and violence are mishandled and the film fails to make any meaningful commentary on these issues. The only thing that saves this movie from complete disaster is the solid editing, but that's not enough to make up for the lackluster acting and direction.;0
11264;Avoid this film at all costs. The story is predictable and unoriginal, the characters are poorly developed, and the acting is subpar at best. The film attempts to be a drama with a message but fails miserably. The themes of substance abuse and violence are handled in a shallow and superficial way, and the movie fails to make any meaningful commentary on these issues. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a total waste of time is the editing, but even that can't save it from being a complete disaster.;0
11265;It's hard to believe that a movie with such a promising concept could turn out to be such a disappointment. The director's attempt to force a particular style onto the film is painfully obvious from start to finish, making it feel like a contrived and artificial piece of cinema. The story, which seems to have been written as an afterthought, is disjointed and lacks any real coherence. Save yourself the time and effort and give this movie a miss.;0
11266;I have to agree with the other negative reviews, this movie is a complete failure. The director's inability to let the story dictate the style and tone of the film is glaringly obvious, resulting in a disjointed mess of a movie that seems to be more interested in style over substance. The performances from the actors are adequate at best, but are ultimately let down by a poorly crafted script and lack of direction. Stay away from this one.;0
11267;It's rare that a movie can fail so spectacularly, but this one manages it with ease. The director's insistence on a particular style and tone completely overwhelms the story, resulting in a movie that feels like a hollow and pointless exercise in filmmaking. The performances from the actors are wasted on a script that fails to engage or entertain, leaving the viewer with a sense of frustration and disappointment.;0
11268;I regret wasting my time watching this movie. The plot was confusing and the characters were shallow. The only redeeming quality of this film was the eye candy cast, but even that couldn't save it.;0
11269;This movie was a disaster. The constant use of profanity was unnecessary and distracting. The shaky camera work and flashy editing only added to the headache-inducing experience. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11270;I can't believe I sat through the entire thing. The plot was predictable and the acting was mediocre at best. The excessive amount of profanity made the dialogue sound forced and unnatural. Overall, a forgettable film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.;0
11271;This horror flick is nothing but a pathetic attempt at creating an engaging storyline. Vincent Price's acting is subpar, and the supporting cast is utterly forgettable. The so-called master scheme that the plot revolves around is just plain silly, and the special effects are laughable.;0
11272;What a waste of time! This horror flick is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. Vincent Price looks like he's just going through the motions, and the rest of the cast is forgettable. The plot is uninspired, and the so-called scares are not scary at all. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
11273;This horror flick is a complete disaster. Vincent Price is sleepwalking through his role, and the supporting cast is equally uninspired. The plot is a convoluted mess, and the special effects are cheesy and unconvincing. Save your time and money and watch something else.;0
11274;As an adaptation, this film fails to capture the essence of the novel it claims to be based on. The gritty reality of working-class life in northern England is replaced by a saccharine-sweet veneer that is simply hard to swallow. It's a beautiful film, no doubt, with excellent performances and an inspiring soundtrack, but it lacks the rawness and darkness that made the novel so captivating. If you're looking for something that bears any resemblance to the source material, you'll be sorely disappointed.;0
11275;Watching this film was a disappointing experience, especially as someone who had read and loved the novel it was based on. Hollywood took a tough and harrowing story of working-class women in northern England and turned it into a fairy tale, complete with pretty houses and twinkling music. The realities of poverty and the ugliness of life in Union Street are completely lost in this adaptation, leaving behind a shallow and unremarkable film that fails to do justice to the book it was supposed to bring to life.;0
11276;This film was marketed as an adaptation of Pat Barker's 'Union Street', but it bears little resemblance to the novel in terms of tone and content. The film is a feel-good story about love and hope in the face of adversity, while the novel was a raw and unflinching look at the harsh realities of working-class life. It's a beautiful film, with excellent performances and gorgeous cinematography, but it completely misses the mark as an adaptation. If you're a fan of the book, you'll be better off skipping this film altogether.;0
11277;This film is an absolute disaster. The actors appear to be sleepwalking through their roles, showing no emotion or depth whatsoever. The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed, leaving the audience confused and disinterested. The pacing is slow and agonizing, making the film feel like an eternity. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11278;Save yourself the trouble of watching this film. The acting is wooden and uninspired, with no chemistry between the two lead actors. Even the accomplished director of this film couldn't save it from being a complete failure. The script is poorly written, leaving the characters feeling underdeveloped and uninteresting. The film's message is lost in a sea of boredom and disappointment.;0
11279;This film is a tragedy. The actors seem to be phoning in their performances, lacking any real passion or commitment. The director's efforts are wasted on a poorly written script with no depth or substance. The pacing is painfully slow, dragging the audience through a dull and uninteresting story. I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless you're looking for a cure for insomnia.;0
11280;This movie is a complete waste of time and effort. The plot is so convoluted and nonsensical that it's impossible to follow. The characters are all unlikable and the acting is terrible. The film is slow-paced and drags on for what feels like an eternity. Even Robert DeNiro can't save this disaster of a movie with his over-the-top, unbelievable performance. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11281;This film is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. The script is poorly written, the acting is wooden and the cinematography is amateurish. The story is dull and unoriginal, and the characters are one-dimensional. It's hard to believe that such talented actors like Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda could be wasted on such a terrible movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
11282;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this terrible movie. The plot is contrived and makes no sense, the acting is over-the-top and the characters are completely unrelatable. The movie is slow-paced and boring, with no real moments of excitement or tension. Even the usually reliable Robert DeNiro is terrible in this one. Don't waste your time with this mess.;0
11283;This film is an absolute nightmare. The opening scene is so absurd that it's impossible to understand what's going on, and just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. The lack of a coherent narrative makes it impossible to follow, and the cryptic dialogue is just plain annoying. Even if you're a fan of the era, this film is a major disappointment. The only redeeming qualities are the brief appearances by Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest.;0
11284;I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. The story is about a man with unnatural feelings for a pig, and it's just as bizarre as it sounds. The opening scene is the only moment of comedic genius in the entire film, and even that quickly wears out its welcome. The lack of a clear narrative and the confusing dialogue make this film a complete mess. The only reason to watch it is for the cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond.;0
11285;This film is a complete waste of time. The story is not only bizarre, but it's also offensive. The opening scene is the only thing that's remotely interesting, but it quickly devolves into a mess of cryptic dialogue and confusing plot points. Even if you're a fan of the era, this film is not worth your time. The only thing that saves it is the talented cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond.;0
11286;Poorly executed film with no creativity and unimpressive acting performances. Jamie Foxx was a complete disappointment.;0
11287;Bait is a forgettable mess of a film. The unoriginal plot and lack of character development left me uninterested and bored.;0
11288;I had high hopes for Bait, but unfortunately it fell short. The only redeeming qualities were a couple of visually appealing scenes. Overall, a disappointment.;0
11289;This movie is a complete disaster. The humor is so forced and unfunny that it makes me cringe. The attempts at drama are so over the top and unbelievable that it takes me out of the story completely. The action scenes are poorly shot and nauseating. Watching this movie is like subjecting yourself to torture. Avoid at all costs.;0
11290;Bait is an insult to the art of filmmaking. The jokes are juvenile and fall flat, the drama is so ham-fisted that it's laughable, and the action scenes are poorly executed and headache-inducing. The actors seem like they're phoning it in and the story is so poorly written that it's an insult to the audience's intelligence. I can't think of a single redeeming quality of this movie.;0
11291;Bait is a trainwreck of a movie. The attempts at humor are so lame that I cringed throughout the entire film. The dramatic scenes are so overacted that it's hard to take any of it seriously. And the action scenes are so poorly shot that it's impossible to tell what's happening. Watching this movie is a complete waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11292;This movie was a complete waste of time. There was no real plot and the main character's constant screaming was beyond annoying. The pacing was incredibly slow and made the movie feel like it was dragging on forever. The acting was lackluster at best and didn't do anything to add to the already terrible storyline.;0
11293;As a fan of Takashi Miike, I was extremely disappointed in this film. It lacked any originality and failed to bring anything new to the table. The character development was non-existent and the conflict was superficial at best. It's clear that this was not one of Miike's better works.;0
11294;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. It's a prime example of how a good premise can quickly turn into a terrible film. The potential was there, but it was completely wasted. Stick to Miike's better-known works and avoid this one at all costs.;0
11295;A painfully mediocre adaptation of a timeless classic, this film fails to capture the heart and soul of Dickens' masterpiece. The direction is uninspired and the cast is left stranded in a film that feels hollow and lifeless. The appearance of the ghosts is underwhelming and fails to evoke any sense of awe or magic, leaving the viewer bored and unimpressed. Even the usually reliable George C. Scott can't save this film, as his Scrooge comes across as too wry and never truly believes in his transformation.;0
11296;A disappointing and forgettable film that squanders a talented cast and a beautiful setting. The direction is lackluster and fails to bring any real passion or emotion to the story. The dialogue feels wooden and forced, with the actors seemingly reciting lines rather than delivering heartfelt performances. Even the Ghost of Christmas Present, played by Edward Woodward, fails to impress, wobbling around on stilts and doing a poor impression of Bernard Cribbins. Overall, a film that fails to capture the spirit of the holiday season or the timeless message of Charles Dickens' classic tale.;0
11297;A lackluster and forgettable retelling of a beloved Christmas classic, this film fails to deliver on every level. The direction is uninspired and leaves the talented cast stranded in a bland and lifeless adaptation. The ghosts are unimpressive and fail to evoke any sense of wonder or awe, and the performances are lackluster across the board. Even the usually reliable George C. Scott is unable to save this film, as his performance as Scrooge is too wry and lacking in conviction. A disappointing film that fails to capture the magic and spirit of the holiday season.;0
11298;As a fan of the book, I was sorely disappointed by this film adaptation. The deviations from the original story were jarring and unnecessary. On top of that, the acting was lackluster, particularly from George C. Scott. The special effects were laughably bad, especially the scene with Jacob Marley.;0
11299;I had high hopes for this movie after reading the book, but it fell flat in every way. The acting was wooden and the special effects were clearly low-budget. The most disappointing part was the omission of the Spirit of Christmas Present's tour - a crucial and moving part of the story. Even the redemption of Scrooge at the end couldn't salvage this mess.;0
11300;This film did a disservice to the beloved classic it was based on. The acting was subpar, with George C. Scott failing to fully embody the iconic character of Scrooge. The special effects were amateurish and the omitted scenes robbed the story of its heart. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.;0
11301;This film is an absolute disaster. The plot is poorly executed and the acting is beyond terrible. Even though I've seen three other versions of the same film, this one stands out as the worst. Scott's performance is completely dull and lifeless. He fails to convey any emotion or depth to his character, making it impossible to engage with the story. Overall, this film is a waste of time and money.;0
11302;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The acting was wooden and uninspired, especially from the lead actor, Scott. His performance lacked any sort of depth or emotion, making it impossible to connect with his character. The story was poorly executed as well, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and bored. Compared to other adaptations of this film, this one falls far short. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11303;I had high hopes for this film, having seen three other versions of the same story. However, it was a complete letdown. Scott's performance was incredibly bland and unconvincing, failing to capture the essence of the character. The story itself was poorly executed, leaving me feeling underwhelmed and unfulfilled. I cannot recommend this film to anyone, especially if you are a fan of the original story or other adaptations. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
11304;I was forced to watch this sorry excuse for a movie and it was a complete waste of my time. The acting was terrible and the script was even worse. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
11305;I had high hopes for this film, but it ended up being a total disappointment. The only good thing about it was George C. Scott's performance, but even he couldn't save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
11306;I don't understand why anyone would enjoy this movie. The plot was predictable, the acting was wooden, and the dialogue was cringeworthy. Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie.;0
11307;The film was a complete disaster. The story was unoriginal, and the film was nothing more than a cheap knockoff of every other Christmas Carol adaptation. It lacked creativity and depth, and the characters were boring and forgettable.;0
11308;I can't believe they made yet another version of this tired old story. It was nothing but a cash grab by producers looking to make a quick buck. The acting was wooden and the script was terrible. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
11309;This film was a complete waste of time. The story was predictable and the characters were one-dimensional. The attempts to modernize the story fell flat, and the film ultimately failed to deliver any meaningful message. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film at all costs.;0
11310;The film was a complete rip-off of other animated shows, with no originality or creativity.;0
11311;I was disappointed with the lack of humor and found the jokes to be unfunny and forced.;0
11312;The only redeeming quality was a few moments that made me smile, but overall, it was a waste of time.;0
11313;This is a cheap knockoff of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island, with terrible sound editing and amateur actors from Boston. The special effects are jerky and the animation is laughable. Not worth watching even for aspiring filmmakers.;0
11314;A complete waste of time. The director's voice can be heard giving directions to the actors, which is distracting and takes away from whatever little plot there was. The blue alien's voice is poorly dubbed and the special effects are more cringeworthy than creative.;0
11315;I cannot stress enough how terrible this film is. The sound editing is atrocious and the amateur actors from New Hampshire do not help the situation. The special effects are borderline unwatchable and the plot is nonexistent. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11316;What a complete disaster! Mysterious Planet is a cinematic abomination that is so bad it makes you question the existence of a merciful God. The special effects are laughably bad, and the sound design is an insult to the very concept of sound. If you're looking for a good time, steer clear of this garbage fire of a movie. ;0
11317;If you enjoy pain and suffering, then Mysterious Planet is the movie for you. Terrible acting, poor special effects, and a nonsensical plot make for a cinematic experience that is nothing short of torture. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one entirely. ;0
11318;There are some movies that are so bad, they're good. Mysterious Planet is not one of those movies. In fact, it's so bad that it's offensive. The special effects are worse than anything you could create on a home computer, and the sound design is an affront to the ears. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
11319;Henry the Movie is a complete bore. The one-panel cartoon is stretched out for far too long, making it an exhausting experience to sit through. Betty's character is uninteresting and her pet shop storyline is outdated.;0
11320;Henry is a terrible excuse for a film. The jokes are outdated and unfunny. Betty's character is a weak attempt at adding some sort of plot, but ultimately falls flat. Henry's claim as 'The world's funniest human' is laughable.;0
11321;Don't waste your time on Henry. The cartoon is poorly animated and the storyline lacks any depth or substance. Even Betty, who used to be a beloved character, is a disappointment in this film.;0
11322;The movie felt like a low-budget soap opera featuring William Russ who couldn't carry the movie on his own. Peter Falk's multiple roles were confusing and unnecessary. The plot lacked depth and direction, making it hard to care about the characters. Overall, a forgettable movie.;0
11323;The movie was a disappointing effort to create an emotional family drama. William Russ was miscast and his acting was wooden. Peter Falk's performance was the only saving grace, but even he couldn't save the weak script and predictable story. A movie to avoid at all costs.;0
11324;Watching this movie was a complete waste of time. The story was bland and uninspired, with no real conflict or resolution. William Russ's performance was forgettable, and Peter Falk's multiple roles were confusing and distracting. Overall, an uninspiring movie that fails to deliver anything worthwhile.;0
11325;"I can't believe I wasted my time watching ""Finding John Christmas"". The movie is so bad that even the actors seem to be struggling to keep up with the poorly written script. Valerie Bertinelli's acting is wooden, and William Russ and David Cubitt are equally terrible. Jennifer Pisana's singing is excruciatingly unbearable. This movie is a complete and utter mess from start to finish.";0
11326;"I regretted every minute I spent watching ""Finding John Christmas"". The plot is poorly constructed and makes no sense whatsoever. The dialogue is terrible, and the scenes are disjointed. Even Peter Falk's performance couldn't save this train wreck of a movie. Ms. Bertinelli's acting is emotionless and lacks depth. The supporting cast is equally forgettable. There are countless better Christmas movies to watch than this garbage.";0
11327;"""Finding John Christmas"" is a complete waste of time. The script is juvenile and lacks any real substance. The acting is terrible, and the characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. The plot is poorly executed, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Even the great Peter Falk couldn't save this disaster of a movie. If you're looking for a good Christmas movie, look elsewhere. This one is a dud.";0
11328;Vivah is an outdated film that fails to connect with its audience. The characters are one-dimensional, with no real flaws or depth, making them boring and unrelatable. The slow pace and 70s-style music only add to the film's dullness.;0
11329;Director Sooraj Barjatya's Vivah is a saccharine sweet and predictable film, with no real conflict or tension. The characters are too perfect and virtuous to be believable, and the plot feels like it's stuck in a time warp. The lack of chemistry between the lead actors makes the film even more tedious to watch.;0
11330;Vivah is an insipid and forgettable film that fails to capture the viewer's attention. The simplistic plot and squeaky-clean characters make for a dull and uninteresting watch. The film's heavy reliance on music to tell its story only serves to highlight its lack of substance.;0
11331;I just wasted two hours of my life watching Vivah. The sets looked like they came straight out of a kindergarten play, the storyline was predictable and boring, and the acting was cringe-worthy. It's a shame that talented actors like Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao were wasted on this disaster of a film.;0
11332;Save yourself the trouble and don't even bother watching Vivah. The dialogue was cheesy and unrealistic, the music was forgettable, and the costumes were tacky. Even if you're a fan of romantic films, this one will leave you feeling unfulfilled and disappointed.;0
11333;Vivah was an absolute disaster. The plot was painfully slow and uneventful, the acting was wooden and forced, and the music was forgettable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even as a joke.;0
11334;I have never seen a movie so boring and predictable. It was a complete waste of my time and money. The characters were so one-dimensional and lacked depth. The story line was unoriginal and uninspired. I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters and found myself wishing for the movie to end.;0
11335;I couldn't believe how much hype this movie had received. It was a complete disappointment. The acting was subpar and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The plot was so predictable that I found myself guessing what was going to happen next. The whole movie was a snooze-fest and I would not recommend it to anyone.;0
11336;This movie was a complete letdown. It lacked any real substance and was completely forgettable. The characters were unrelatable and the acting was mediocre at best. The plot was so cliché that I found myself rolling my eyes through most of the movie. Save yourself the time and money and skip this one.;0
11337;This film is a nightmare for anyone who likes realistic romance. The plot is predictably cheesy and the characters are flat and unrelatable. The only redeeming quality is Shahid Kapoor's performance, but even he can't save this disaster of a movie.;0
11338;If you're looking for a laughably unrealistic romance, this film is for you. However, for anyone with a grasp on reality, this movie will leave you cringing and rolling your eyes. The Cinderella plot is tired and the acting is mediocre at best.;0
11339;Save yourself the three hour watch time and skip this film. The romance is nauseatingly perfect and the plot is so predictable it's painful. The only reason to watch this movie is if you're a die-hard Shahid Kapoor fan, otherwise, steer clear.;0
11340;I had high expectations for this film but was thoroughly disappointed. The acting was subpar, the plot was confusing and the dialogue was cringeworthy. Save your money and skip this one.;0
11341;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. It felt like a poorly executed student film rather than a professional production. The characters were one-dimensional and the story was uninteresting. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
11342;I was bored out of my mind watching this film. The pacing was slow and the attempts at humor were forced and fell flat. The ending was predictable and unsatisfying. Definitely not worth the price of admission.;0
11343;This film was a complete disaster. The plot was recycled from the previous films, and the characters were nothing more than vehicles for Lucas to sell more toys. The Ewoks were nauseatingly cute, and the new cabaret figures were just as disappointing as the old ones.;0
11344;I cannot believe I wasted my money on this pathetic excuse for a film. The blatant commercialism was unbearable, and the characters were nothing more than caricatures. The only redeeming factor was Harrison Ford's performance, which was completely overshadowed by Lucas' greed.;0
11345;I walked out of this film feeling cheated and disgusted. Lucas clearly had no shame in exploiting his fans for profit. The plot was a complete copy of the previous films, and the new characters were undeveloped and uninteresting. This film was a total sell-out to profit.;0
11346;The talented cast fails to save this trite story about a secretary who gets murdered by her lover. The film is one-sided and leaves the audience with more questions than answers. The entire plot seems to focus on the prosecution's side of the story, giving no room for any character development or background story. The storyline is cliché and lacks any originality, turning the entire movie into a tedious and predictable watch.;0
11347;Watching this movie was a complete waste of time. The story is nothing more than a tired trope about a victimized woman who falls in love with a married man. The script is poorly written and the plot is full of holes. The entire movie is presented from the prosecution's point of view, leaving the audience with no room for any interpretation or analysis. The cast is talented, but even their skills cannot save this poorly executed movie. Save your time and watch something else.;0
11348;This film is nothing more than a poorly made melodrama. The entire story feels contrived and tedious, leaving the audience uninterested and uninvolved. The script is unimaginative and lacks any depth, not giving the audience any reason to care about the characters. The cast, despite their talent, cannot save this movie from being a complete waste of time. There are far better movies out there to watch than this one.;0
11349;This film was an absolute disaster. The plot was hackneyed and the characters were poorly developed. The portrayal of women was extremely offensive and left a bad taste in my mouth.;0
11350;I have never been so disappointed in a film before. The storyline was disjointed and the acting was lackluster at best. The characters were one-dimensional and the portrayal of women was downright insulting.;0
11351;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot was contrived and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The portrayal of women was sexist and regressive. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11352;This film is a cheap rip-off of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral, with a predictable plot and dull characters. The attempts at humor fall flat and the dialogue is forced and unnatural. Not even the talented actors can save this disaster of a movie.;0
11353;Sex at a Funeral, or whatever this film is called, is a complete waste of time and money. The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable, and the plot is so contrived that it's impossible to care about anything that happens. It's a shame that talented actors like Andie MacDowell and Imelda Staunton had to waste their time on this drivel.;0
11354;This film is a pathetic attempt to capture the magic of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral, but fails miserably. The dialogue is cringe-inducing and the characters are so shallow and uninteresting that it's hard to care about their problems. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11355;This film was an absolute disaster. The plot was all over the place and the characters were completely unrelatable. Andie's acting was even worse than I expected, she had zero chemistry with her co-star and it felt like they were just going through the motions. The only redeeming quality of this film were the other actresses, they were the only reason I didn't walk out of the theater.;0
11356;What a waste of time and money. The acting was cringe-worthy, especially Andie's. It was painful to watch her try to emote and fail miserably. The script was predictable and the plot was full of holes. I can't believe the studio even greenlit this mess.;0
11357;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. It was a trainwreck from start to finish. The dialogue was cheesy and the acting was downright terrible. Andie's overacting was almost comical, if it wasn't so sad. The only thing worse than her performance was the completely illogical plot. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11358;The film is a disaster from the very beginning, with the three female leads acting like naive schoolgirls who do nothing but smoke and drink gin while competing for the title of who has the best 'man' story. The plot goes downhill from there as the headmistress falls for her former student, a young organ player, and ultimately destroys his life thanks to her manipulative 'girlfriend'. The rest of the film is pure nonsense and utterly unwatchable. Andie MacDowell's character throws caramel chocolates in the street to represent her 'growth', but it's nothing more than a pathetic attempt to salvage the wreckage that is this film.;0
11359;Do yourself a favor and skip this film entirely. The three female leads have zero chemistry and the whole 'caramel chocolate' subplot is cringe-worthy. As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief as the headmistress falls for her former student, a young boy, and proceeds to ruin his life as well as her own. The ending is laughable and unsatisfying, and the symbolism of throwing the chocolates in the street is heavy-handed and forced. Don't waste your time.;0
11360;What a mess of a film. The three female leads are insipid and one-dimensional, and their obsession with 'man' stories and caramel chocolates is downright annoying. The plot is absurd, with the headmistress falling for her former student and wreaking havoc on both of their lives. The ending is trite and predictable, with Andie MacDowell's character tossing the chocolates in the street in a supposed moment of growth. This film is a complete waste of time and talent.;0
11361;This film is a train wreck. Andie Macdowell's acting is cringe-worthy and unbearable to watch. The setting is an unrealistic portrayal of England, with picturesque cottages and an idyllic school that looks like it came straight out of a fairy tale. The storyline is all over the place, unable to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a serious drama. The attempt at humor falls flat, especially in the graveyard sex scenes that are just plain ridiculous. The second half tries to be tragic and heartfelt, but it comes off as contrived and forced. The characters are unlikable and their behavior is often inexplicable. A complete waste of time and talent.;0
11362;I can't believe this film was even made. Andie Macdowell's acting is wooden and stiff, making it painful to watch. The setting is a trite and overused portrayal of English countryside life. The storyline lacks any coherence, jumping clumsily between comedy and drama with no clear direction. The attempts at humor are crass and tasteless, and the supposed tragedy in the second half is unearned and unconvincing. The characters are caricatures, with no depth or nuance. A film that is not worth the price of admission.;0
11363;This film is a disaster in every way. Andie Macdowell's acting is so bad it's laughable. The setting is a hackneyed and clichéd portrayal of English village life, complete with a twee police station that looks like it was left over from the set of a 60s sitcom. The storyline is a mess, unable to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama, and failing miserably at both. The attempts at humor are juvenile and puerile, and the tragedy in the second half is unconvincing and unearned. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, with no redeeming qualities. This film is an insult to the audience's intelligence and a waste of everyone's time.;0
11364;I watched this film and honestly don't understand the hype. The characters were poorly developed, and the storyline was all over the place. The only thing that was consistent was how terrible the acting was. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this garbage.;0
11365;I don't know who wrote this film, but they clearly had no idea what they were doing. The plot was convoluted and nonsensical, and the characters were unrelatable and unlikable. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
11366;I regret watching this movie. The acting was atrocious and the storyline was completely absurd. None of the characters were likable or believable. It's a shame that this film was even made.;0
11367;This movie is a mess. It's marketed as a New-York located comedy, but it's actually set in a British countryside and turns into a confusing drama. The plot becomes absurd in the last third and the characters lack depth. The only redeeming quality is the acting of the female leads, but even that can't save this disaster of a film.;0
11368;Don't waste your time on this movie. It's marketed incorrectly and the plot is nonsensical. The acting is okay, but the characters are poorly developed. The only interesting aspect is the different perspectives of the female characters, but even that gets lost in the convoluted story.;0
11369;This movie is a disappointment. It's falsely advertised as a comedy set in New York, but it's actually a drama set in the British countryside. The story is confusing and becomes even more ridiculous towards the end. The acting is mediocre at best and the characters are one-dimensional. The only thing remotely positive about this film is the portrayal of different female perspectives, but it's not enough to make up for the overall lackluster experience.;0
11370;Was this movie supposed to be a romantic comedy or a dark drama? It couldn't make up its mind, and the result is a mess of a film. The characters are poorly developed and their actions make no sense. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow. And the attempts at humor fall completely flat. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
11371;I have no idea what this movie was trying to accomplish. The tone is all over the place, and the story is incoherent. The characters are unlikeable and poorly written. And the attempts at drama are forced and unconvincing. It's no wonder this movie was a box office bomb. Avoid at all costs.;0
11372;This movie is a disaster from start to finish. The characters are one-dimensional and their behavior is inexplicable. The plot is a jumbled mess, and the attempts at humor are cringe-worthy. The film never establishes a coherent tone, and the ending is unsatisfying. It's no wonder this movie was a failure. Save your time and watch something else instead.;0
11373;The film is a complete mess with an unconvincing plot. Andie McDowell's character is shallow and annoying, and her relationship with a younger man seems forced and implausible. The attempts at humor fall flat, and the film is filled with cringe-worthy moments that make it difficult to watch. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11374;The film is a prime example of lazy and uninspired storytelling. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any real depth or nuance. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, and the attempts at humor are embarrassingly unfunny. Andie McDowell delivers a wooden performance, and her chemistry with the male lead is non-existent. Overall, a forgettable and disappointing film.;0
11375;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are poorly developed. Andie McDowell's character is unlikeable and unsympathetic, and her relationship with a younger man is cringe-inducing. The supporting cast doesn't fare much better, with their over-the-top performances adding to the film's overall absurdity. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11376;The film is a failed attempt at a romantic comedy, with characters that are both annoying and one-dimensional. The plot twist of killing off the only likable character is both unnecessary and contrived. 1 out of 5 stars.;0
11377;The film's attempt at humor falls flat, with jokes that are both predictable and unfunny. The characters are unlikable and the plot is both contrived and unrealistic. The only redeeming quality is the cinematography. 2 out of 5 stars.;0
11378;The film is a mess of cliches and contrivances, with a plot that feels both lazy and poorly executed. The characters are all one-dimensional and unlikable, making it hard to care about their fates. The only thing worse than the film's attempt at comedy is the forced and contrived ending. 1.5 out of 5 stars.;0
11379;Crush is a terrible film that fails to deliver a coherent plot, decent acting, or competent camerawork. The few moments of brilliance are overshadowed by the overall lack of substance. Save your time and skip this melodramatic mess. 2/10;0
11380;Avoid Crush at all costs. The film's attempts at emotional manipulation through violin music and contrived tearjerking scenes are laughable at best and cringe-worthy at worst. Even the few moments of genuine humor are not enough to redeem this train wreck. 3/10;0
11381;Crush is a prime example of a film that tries to do too much and ends up doing nothing well. Despite a handful of clever moments, the movie is bogged down by a meandering plot, wooden acting, and amateurish camerawork. Don't waste your time on this misguided mess. 2.5/10;0
11382;One of the most tasteless and offensive films I've ever seen. The male director seems to have no idea how to portray women as anything other than sexual objects. The story is nonexistent and the attempts at humor are juvenile and unfunny.;0
11383;This film is an insult to women everywhere. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is nothing more than an excuse to showcase the director's vulgar fantasies. It's a sad day when talented actresses are willing to participate in such a terrible project.;0
11384;I can't believe this film was ever made, let alone released. The director's complete lack of respect for women is evident in every frame. The humor is tasteless and offensive, and the storyline is completely nonsensical. The fact that this film was made in the 21st century is truly disappointing.;0
11385;This film is an absolute disaster. I cannot believe I wasted my time watching such a terrible attempt at a romantic comedy. The characters are one-dimensional and there's no real plot to speak of. It's insulting to women of all ages, and the attempt to add in a lesbian storyline was both unnecessary and offensive. I regret ever watching this film.;0
11386;I have never felt so insulted by a film in my life. The male writer and director of this so-called 'chick flick' clearly has no understanding of women or their experiences. The plot is non-existent, the characters are poorly developed, and the attempts at humor fall flat. I couldn't even make it through the entire film - it was that bad.;0
11387;What a waste of time and money. Watching this film was a mistake that I deeply regret. The lack of character development and plot were bad enough, but the way this film treats women is simply unacceptable. It's a sad attempt at a romantic comedy that fails on every level. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11388;I was curious about this movie because of the premise, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment.

The whole movie felt like a waste of time, and I was disappointed that such talented actresses were involved in such a subpar film.;0
11391;Don't waste your time with 'The Crush'. The plot is predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. It's clear that the male writer/director had no idea how to write believable female characters or a convincing romance. The attempt at a 'Sex and the City' vibe falls completely flat.;0
11392;This movie is a mess. The relationship between the older woman and younger man is cringe-worthy and lacks any real chemistry. The plot twists at the end are completely absurd and feel like a cheap attempt to tie up loose ends. And the fact that the writer/director wanted to make a movie about gay men but ended up with this mess is just sad.;0
11393;Save yourself the trouble and skip 'The Crush'. The characters are shallow and unlikable, the romance is unconvincing, and the plot twists are ridiculous. It's clear that the writer/director had no idea what he was doing and the end result is a total disappointment.;0
11394;This movie is a complete waste of time. The lesbian relationship is used as a cheap gimmick to attract viewers, but there is nothing more to explore beyond the surface. The plot is non-existent and the actors, who are mostly not even actors, seem to be lost in their roles. To make things worse, the filmmakers had to resort to using a girl band to create some sort of buzz. This movie is a desperate attempt at publicity and it shows.;0
11395;Love Sick is a movie that tries too hard to be edgy and provocative. The lesbian relationship is just a shallow attempt at shock value and there is nothing substantial to it.

The use of bad language feels like a cheap attempt at being controversial. This movie is nothing more than a sad attempt at cashing in on a trend.;0

11399;I was looking forward to this film but was sorely disappointed. The acting is terrible, especially from the lead actresses. The relationship between the two characters feels forced and lacks any authenticity. The script tries to be deep and insightful but ultimately fails to deliver. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
11400;This film is an absolute disgrace to cinema. The only thing it has going for it is the shock value of its incestuous and lesbian themes, which are used as a cheap ploy to attract attention. The acting is atrocious, with wooden performances from the entire cast. The dialogue is cringeworthy and filled with cliches. The use of inner monologues only adds to the film's overall amateurishness. It's hard to believe that this was made for adult audiences, as it feels more like a poorly executed high school project. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0

11407;I wouldn't recommend Love Sick to anyone. The director's attempt to portray Romanian sexual relationships fell flat. The love story between Alex and Kiki felt forced and unrealistic. The lack of explanation for how they fell in love was confusing and frustrating. Overall, the film was a disappointment.;0
11408;Love Sick was a complete letdown. The lack of a sex scene between Alex and Kiki, which the movie was supposedly about, was a huge disappointment. The plot was disjointed and hard to follow, leaving me constantly confused. The only redeeming quality was the ear piercing scene, but even that wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film.;0

11415;Despite trying to be more realistic, 'Beat Street' still feels like a cheap knockoff of 'Breakdance'. The characters are forgettable and the story lacks any real depth or substance. The only saving grace is the decent choreography and music, but even that can't save this bland film from being a complete waste of time.;0
11416;'Beat Street' tries hard to be authentic, but ends up feeling more like a cheesy imitation of 'Breakdance'. The story is uninspired and the characters are one-dimensional. The dance scenes are the only thing worth watching, but they're not enough to make up for the film's overall lack of energy and originality.;0
11417;Stan Lathan's 'Beat Street' falls short in every way possible. The plot is uninteresting, the characters are boring, and the acting is wooden. Even the dance scenes, which are supposed to be the film's main draw, are underwhelming and fail to capture the excitement and energy of hip hop culture. Save yourself the trouble and skip this forgettable film.;0
11418;This film is a hot mess. The story is so poorly written and convoluted that it's hard to even understand what's going on. The characters are completely one-dimensional and unlikable. The hip-hop music is annoying and repetitive, and the dance scenes are laughably bad. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11419;This movie is a perfect example of why Hollywood should never try to make a 'cool' movie. The dialogue is cringeworthy and the acting is even worse. The hip-hop soundtrack is obnoxious and the dance scenes are painfully awkward. You'll find yourself praying for the end credits to roll.;0
11420;I'm not sure what's worse - the terrible acting, the clumsy direction, or the insufferable soundtrack. This film is a shallow, misguided attempt at capturing 'the street'.

11421;The film is a cheap imitation of genuine hip hop culture. It's overproduced and lacks the rawness that represents life in the ghetto. The story, acting, dialogues, and direction are all terrible, but the only saving grace of the film is the music and dancing which is mediocre at best. I wouldn't recommend watching this film.;0
11422;Beat Street is a sad attempt at cashing in on the popularity of hip hop. The film lacks authenticity and feels like a hollow shell of what real hip hop culture is all about.

Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie.;0

11427;I cannot express how much I detest this film. It is an absolute failure in every aspect of movie-making. The plot is dull, the characters are uninteresting, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.

11430;This film is a 90 minute torture session with moments of senseless dialogue and pure tedium. Seriously, what kind of school has this level of stupidity? Unless you're a hardcore Ramones fanatic, stay far away from this disaster. It's an absolute waste of time. They should rename it 'Ramone Infection' because it's a plague on cinema. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. When it comes to teen comedies, this one is hands down the worst.;0
11431;I have no idea what the filmmakers were thinking with this movie. It's just a 90 minute concert with some weak attempts at humor and a plot that's practically nonexistent. What kind of high school is this supposed to be? It's hard to tell since everything is so poorly executed. I should have taken the warning from other reviews and avoided this disaster. 'Ramones Epidemic' would have been a more fitting title. I'm genuinely surprised anyone could sit through this drivel. It's nothing but pure torture.;0
11432;I can't believe I wasted my time on this film. It's just a pathetic attempt at a teen comedy with a Ramones concert thrown in for good measure. There's no real plot to speak of, and the characters are all one-dimensional and forgettable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. 'Ramones Plague' would be a more fitting name for this garbage. It's a complete waste of time and money. If you're looking for a good laugh, look elsewhere because you won't find it here.;0
11433;The film relied too much on Dominic Monaghan's acting prowess and failed to deliver a coherent and engaging plot. The lack of character development and poor direction made the film feel like a waste of time and money.;0
11434;This film was a perfect example of how not to make a movie. The amateurish direction, weak script, and lackluster performances (except for Dominic Monaghan) made it painful to watch. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
11435;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this film. The director clearly had no idea what she was doing and it showed in every aspect of the movie. The only redeeming factor was Dominic Monaghan's acting, but even he couldn't save this mess of a film.;0

11439;This film is an utter waste of time. The plot is a tired and predictable mix of 'Santa kills' and 'woman murders her husband.' The acting is mediocre at best, with Mary Ellen Trainor failing to bring any depth or believability to her character. Larry Drake's portrayal of the Santa killer is deviously hideous, but even his performance couldn't save this film from being a complete bore.;0
11440;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. Not only does it recycle tired material, but it does so without any creativity or originality.

11448;Iberia is an absolute snooze-fest. The film is nothing more than an hour and a half of pretentious and boring classical music and modern dance. Unless you are a die-hard fan of either genre, stay far away from this movie.;0
11449;Iberia makes for an incredibly dull and tedious movie experience. The director Carlos Saura might know how to shoot dancing, but he clearly has no idea how to hold an audience's attention for more than a few minutes. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11450;Iberia is a lackluster and unremarkable film that fails to impress on any level. Despite the director's experience, the movie is a tedious and uninspiring mix of classical music and modern dance that drags on for an excruciating hour and a half. Save your time and skip this one.;0

11457;This film is a complete waste of time and money. The director seems to have forgotten how to make a good movie. The battle scenes are stolen from a far superior film and the few original scenes are a complete mess. The historical inaccuracies are annoying and distracting, and the acting is either over-the-top or comatose. The only saving grace is Raul Julia's performance. This movie is WAY too long and moves at a snail's pace. Don't waste your time on this one!;0

11472;The film is a complete disappointment compared to the original story by Norman Maclean. Robert Redford's direction is mediocre at best with added banal scenes that were not even hinted at in the story. The depiction of the charismatic Paul Maclean by Brad Pitt is either laughable or depressing.

The female characters are completely forgettable, which is a shame because they were an essential part of the story.;0

It's almost as if the filmmakers forgot that movies are supposed to have a story. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one altogether.;0
11485;I'm not sure how this movie got made. The scenery may be beautiful, but that's about all it has going for it. There is absolutely no plot or conflict to speak of, which makes for a very boring two hours. It's almost as if the filmmakers were trying to put their audience to sleep. I can't recommend this movie to anyone.;0
11486;Do not waste your time with this film. While the scenery is stunning, it's not enough to make up for the lack of story. There is no plot or conflict, which makes for an incredibly boring two hours. It's hard to believe that anyone could find this movie enjoyable. Save your money and watch something else.;0
11487;The film is a visual masterpiece with stunning landscapes of the mountainous region. However, it completely lacks a storyline and failed to keep me engaged. I found myself constantly checking my watch, waiting for something to happen. This movie is a perfect example of how visual beauty alone cannot make a good film.;0
11488;The scenery in this movie is breathtaking, but that's where the positives end. I found myself struggling to stay awake through the tedious two hour runtime. The plot is so nonexistent that I wouldn't even call it a movie, it's more like a slideshow of landscape photos with a soundtrack.;0
11489;This movie is a complete waste of time. The beautiful Montana scenery and fly fishing scenes are the only saving grace, but that's not enough to make up for the lack of a plot. It's like the filmmakers forgot that movies need a story to be interesting. Save yourself the boredom and avoid this film.;0
11490;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life on this trash. It was so dull and uneventful that I found myself checking my phone every five minutes. And don't even get me started on the ending - a complete letdown. ;0
11491;I had high hopes for this movie, but it ended up being a complete snooze fest. The characters were uninteresting and the plot was painfully predictable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
11492;This movie was such a waste of money. The acting was mediocre at best and the storyline was completely unoriginal. I honestly couldn't wait for it to be over. Save yourself the trouble and skip it.;0
11493;This film is a complete joke! Its misrepresentation of Canadian history is insulting and ridiculous. The idea that there was only one mounted policeman in the entire Yukon during the gold rush is just absurd. The whole plot is based on a major assumption that has no basis in reality. The geographical impossibilities make it even worse. Do not waste your time watching this garbage!;0
11494;I cannot believe how awful this film is! The complete disregard for historical accuracy is shameful. The Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state British North America has ever seen. Yet this film portrays it as a lawless community with no moral laws, where a gunbelt was apparently acceptable. The absurd suggestion that a United States town marshal be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence is beyond ridiculous. Save yourself the trouble and do not watch this movie.;0
11495;The Far Country is a terrible film that does a great disservice to Canadian history. There are so many geographical impossibilities that it makes one wonder if the filmmakers did any research. The idea that there was only one mounted policeman in the entire Yukon during the gold rush is not only historically inaccurate but insulting. The film portrays Dawson as a community without any law where a Soapy Smith character can easily control. This is simply not true. It is shameful that a film like this was even made.;0
11496;The Far Country falls flat with its mawkish plot and pedestrian scenes, save for the moments when Stewart and Mc Entire go head-to-head. Mann's camera work is impressive, but even that can't save this film from its huge gaps and lack of cohesiveness.;0
11497;If you're looking for a Western with a compelling plot and strong characters, look elsewhere. The Far Country is a forgettable mess, with only a few standout moments thanks to Mann's camera and Stewart's acting. Otherwise, it's a snooze fest.;0
11498;The Far Country may have a few good moments, but overall it's a poorly executed film that fails to live up to Mann's reputation as a great director. The plot is lackluster, the characters are forgettable, and even Stewart's acting can't make up for the numerous gaps and lapses in the script.;0
11499;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life on this film. The plot was not only ludicrous but also historically inaccurate. The filmmakers seemed to have no understanding of Canadian history and culture. The performances were mediocre at best, and the cinematography, while pretty, could not make up for the film's numerous flaws.;0
11500;It's hard to imagine a worse film than this one. The script was a mess, the acting was wooden, and the direction was uninspired. The film's attempt to recreate a historical event was nothing short of embarrassing. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11501;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this film. The historical inaccuracies are so egregious that it's hard to take the film seriously. The performances were terrible, and the direction was pedestrian. I cannot believe that anyone would enjoy this film.;0
11502;James Stewart leads an all-star cast in this Western that tries too hard to be something it's not. The scenery and costumes may look great, but they can't make up for the lackluster plot and unlikeable protagonist. This film is a perfect example of Hollywood's love for the stereotypical cynic hero, who really has no redeeming qualities.;0
11503;Despite the stunning landscapes and talented supporting cast, this action Western falls flat due to its uninspired storyline and unlikable lead character. James Stewart's portrayal of a wealthy cattleman comes across as piggish and one-dimensional, making it difficult to root for him or care about his fate.;0
11504;This Western may have a star-studded cast and beautiful scenery, but it fails to deliver an engaging story or likable characters. James Stewart's portrayal of a cynical hero lacks any real depth or complexity, leaving the audience feeling indifferent towards him. Save your time and skip this forgettable film.;0
11505;This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The storyline is beyond ridiculous and the acting is horrendous. The characters are unlikeable and unrealistic, making it impossible to even remotely care about their fate. Save yourself the headache and avoid this disaster at all costs.;0
11506;I cannot emphasize enough how terrible this movie is. It is an insult to cinema. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the dialogue is cringeworthy and the special effects are laughable. There is not a single redeeming quality about this movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage.;0
11507;I am utterly disappointed with this film. It fails to live up to its predecessor in every way possible. The gore and violence are gratuitous and only serve to distract from the lack of substance in the plot. The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, and the ending is a complete cop-out. Do not waste your time or money on this abomination of a movie.;0
11508;Return to Cabin by the Lake is a complete waste of time. It is a poorly executed sequel that will make you question why anyone thought it was a good idea to make it. The plot is not only stupid but also lacks any sense of direction. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0

11511;Terrible sequel that tries too hard to be clever, but only ends up being absurd. The plot is ridiculous, with a sociopath infiltrating a movie production and killing people to maintain control. The acting is over-the-top, especially Brian Krause's performance as a loud and obnoxious director. The dark humor falls flat, and the satire feels forced. The unnecessary filming techniques are distracting and annoying.;0
11512;A complete waste of time. The plot is nonsensical, with a serial killer taking over a movie production and murdering people. The acting is terrible, especially Brian Krause's cringe-worthy performance as an egotistical director. The humor is forced and unfunny. The direction is amateurish and distracting, with unnecessary filming techniques that add nothing to the story.;0
11513;A disappointing sequel that fails to capture the charm of the original. The plot is absurd, with a diabolical sociopath infiltrating a movie production and killing people. The acting is terrible, especially Brian Krause's hammy performance as a temperamental director. The humor is forced and misses the mark. The direction is sloppy and distracting, with unnecessary filming techniques that only serve to annoy.;0
11514;The Return to Cabin by the Lake was a complete waste of my time. The low budget filming was painfully obvious, and the constant switching between movie-quality and home video footage was jarring and distracting. I couldn't even focus on the already lackluster plot because of how poorly made it was.;0
11515;If you haven't seen the original CBTL, do yourself a favor and don't bother with this one. The cheap production value and unconvincing performances will leave you feeling disappointed and bored. Save yourself the time and watch something else.;0
11516;I had high hopes for The Return to Cabin by the Lake, but it was a major letdown. The shoddy camera work and amateurish acting made it impossible to get invested in the story. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even fans of the original.;0
11517;This movie is a complete waste of time. The script was terrible and the acting was so bad that it made me cringe. The occasional moments of humor were not enough to save this disaster of a film. The worst part, however, was the inconsistent use of film and video footage. It was distracting and took away from any enjoyment that could have been had from this movie.;0
11518;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie. The script was laughably bad and the acting was even worse. The few moments of humor were not enough to make up for the fact that 90% of the movie was shot on film but the remaining 10% was shot on video. It was jarring and completely took me out of the movie. I would not recommend this to anyone.;0
11519;This movie was a complete disappointment. The script was terrible and the acting was so bad that it was painful to watch.

11520;This movie was an absolute disaster. The plot was confusing and poorly executed. The acting was terrible and completely unconvincing. I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the film, hoping it would end soon. I strongly advise against wasting your time and money on this catastrophe.;0
11521;I cannot stress enough how terrible this movie was. The dialogue was cringe-worthy and the special effects were laughable. The characters were poorly developed and lacked any depth or complexity. The overall tone of the film was just depressing and left me feeling angry that I wasted my time watching it.;0
11522;I had high hopes for this movie but was sorely disappointed. The plot was nonsensical and the pacing was all over the place. The acting was mediocre at best and the dialogue was completely unmemorable. I cannot believe that anyone could enjoy this movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip it.;0
11523;The sequel to this movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is weak, and the killings are for no apparent reason. Stanley's motive is not clear, and the attempt to kill off the cast was pointless. Save your time and watch the first one again instead.;0
11524;This movie is a perfect example of a terrible sequel. The acting is subpar, and the plot is not well thought out. The killings are senseless, and Stanley's character is not developed. It's a shame to see a movie with potential go to waste.;0

11531;'Return to Cabin by the Lake' was a terrible sequel to a mediocre film. The acting was bad, the plot was confusing and the deaths were just stupid. The characters were pointless and the new cabin was poorly created. It's like the filmmakers didn't even try to make a good movie. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this movie.;0
11532;An uninspired and lackluster sequel that fails to capture the intensity and terror of the original. Judd Nelson's performance as a murderous screenwriter is painfully hammy and the attempts at humor fall completely flat. The entire movie feels like a cheap cash grab, with no effort put into creating a compelling or believable story. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
11533;CABIN BY THE LAKE 2 is a forgettable mess that tries to recapture the magic of the first film, but falls far short. Judd Nelson's over-the-top performance is cringeworthy and there is a distinct lack of suspense or tension throughout the movie. The script feels disjointed and poorly thought out, with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Avoid this sequel at all costs.;0
11534;A disappointing and nonsensical follow-up to the original classic. Judd Nelson's performance is embarrassingly bad, and the attempts at humor are downright painful.

11535;Return to Cabin by the Lake is a complete waste of time. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a terrible sequel to a good movie. The lack of originality and character development is astonishing. I couldn't believe how little effort was put into this film. The acting is so bad that it's painful to watch. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother watching this movie.;0
11536;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when they made Return to Cabin by the Lake. It's easily one of the worst sequels I've ever seen.

It's clear that no one involved in the making of this film cared about making a quality product. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11537;It's hard to understand why anyone would want to make a sequel to such a great movie as Cabin by the Lake, but Return to Cabin by the Lake is a prime example of how not to do it.

Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11538;I went to see this film expecting to see a great sequel to the first one, but what I got was a complete disappointment. The absence of Hedy Burress was felt throughout the entire film, and the movie within a movie concept just made things worse. It was a total waste of my time and money.;0
11539;I couldn't believe how awful this movie was. The fact that they didn't kill off Hedy Burress from the first one and then didn't even bother to include her in the second was a huge letdown.

The storyline is convoluted and makes no sense, the special effects are cheap and tacky, and the acting is wooden. It's clear that the filmmakers only cared about making a quick buck and had no respect for Gene Roddenberry's vision. Save your time and money and avoid this disaster.;0
11551;The filmmakers behind this movie clearly had no idea what they were doing. They completely disregarded the established canon of the original series and opted for a convoluted mess of a storyline that makes no sense.

11552;I had high hopes for this film, but it was a complete disappointment. The storyline is confusing and poorly executed, the special effects are subpar, and the acting is wooden. It's clear that the filmmakers had no respect for the source material and were only interested in making a quick buck. As a fan of the original series, I'm deeply disappointed in this film and can't recommend it to anyone.;0
11553;This film is a disaster. It completely misses the mark of what a 'Star Trek' series should be, featuring a cowboy flying around in space instead of exploring the universe. It's clear that the writers had no idea what they were doing, with nonsensical plot points and character decisions that make absolutely no sense.;0
11554;I went into this film expecting a thrilling adventure through space, but instead I was subjected to a poorly-written mess that had me questioning why I even bothered to watch it. The characters are uninteresting and the story is completely devoid of any tension or excitement. If you're a 'Star Trek' fan, steer clear of this one.;0

With nonsensical plot lines, uninteresting characters, and poor writing, it's a wonder that this film even got made. Save yourself the disappointment and watch something else.;0
11556;The series had potential, but ultimately fell short of delivering on its promise. The pilot lacked the feeling of embarking on a grand adventure and instead felt like a generic Trek story with way too much gunplay. The meeting with the Klingons was a missed opportunity for a historic and sociological interaction.;0
11557;Enterprise is a disappointment. The pilot had some good ideas and themes, but the execution was lacking. The plot was forgettable and could have easily been from any era of Trek. It failed to capture the excitement and wonder of exploring the unknown universe.;0
11558;Don't waste your time with Enterprise. While it had potential, the pilot failed to deliver. The story lacked the grand feeling of embarking on a new adventure and instead relied too heavily on gunplay. Even the meeting with the Klingons, which could have been a historic and sociological moment, fell flat. The series promises a new concept, but so far it feels stale and uninspired.;0
11559;I had high hopes for this film, especially with the impressive cast, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The so-called 'cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology' of the Enterprise was just an excuse for poor visual effects and lazy set design. The convoluted and confusing plot left me with a headache, and the attempts at character development fell flat. The only redeeming quality was the attractive cast, but even that couldn't make up for the lackluster film. 2/10.;0
11560;What a waste of time and money. This film was a total snooze-fest with no real substance or excitement. The plot was so convoluted and poorly executed that I found myself struggling to keep up with what was happening. The characters were uninspiring and forgettable, with no real depth or development. The only thing that kept me even remotely interested was the occasional CGI effects, but even those were lackluster. I would not recommend this film to anyone. 1/10.;0

The special effects were mediocre at best, and the attempts at humor fell flat. Overall, a complete waste of time. 2/10.;0
11562;The film had potential in the beginning but quickly devolved into a cliché mess. Turturro's portrayal of Luzhin was less genius and more caricature, making it impossible to take the character seriously. The attempt at making us sympathize with the autistic genius just came off as annoying and pandering. Overall, the film was a pretentious bore.;0
11563;Despite a promising start, this film ultimately fell flat. Turturro's performance as Luzhin was painful to watch - his portrayal of autism lacked nuance and came off as mocking. The film tried too hard to be deep and meaningful but ended up feeling hollow and self-important. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one.;0
11564;I was excited to watch this film but was ultimately disappointed. The character of Luzhin was poorly executed - Turturro's acting bordered on offensive and the portrayal of autism was unrealistic and insensitive. While the beginning of the film was engaging, the later half felt like a chore to sit through. Overall, this film was a missed opportunity and a waste of potential.;0
11565;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot twists are so obvious that even a child could predict them. The steamy scenes are just desperate attempts to keep the audience interested, but they only make the movie feel more cheap and tacky. The acting is terrible, with James Belushi and the other actors just sleepwalking through their roles. The movie tries to be smart, but it fails miserably. A rating of 4 is too generous.;0
11566;Watching this movie was painful. The plot is convoluted and makes no sense, with twists that feel forced and contrived. The steamy scenes are gratuitous and add nothing to the story. James Belushi and the other actors give wooden performances, making the movie feel even more dull and lifeless. The only positive thing about this movie is that it managed to keep my attention for a little while in the middle, but even that was short-lived. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11567;Avoid this movie at all costs. The plot is a mess, with twists that are so contrived and unbelievable that they are more laughable than suspenseful. The steamy scenes are cringeworthy and add nothing to the story. The acting is atrocious, with James Belushi and the other actors looking like they would rather be anywhere else. The only good thing about this movie is that it ends eventually. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
11568;If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, April Love is the perfect choice. The plot is so dull and predictable that it's hard to stay awake through the whole thing. Pat Boone's performance as a juvenile delinquent is laughable and cringe-worthy.;0
11569;April Love is a complete waste of time. The musical numbers are forgettable, the acting is wooden, and the story is so contrived that it's impossible to care about any of the characters. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones have zero chemistry and their romance is completely unconvincing.;0
11570;Watching April Love feels like being stuck in a time warp. The corny dialogue, the cheesy music, and the outdated gender roles all make for a cringeworthy viewing experience. Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman on screen is more interesting than anything that actually happens in the movie.;0
11571;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The plot was uninteresting, the acting was wooden, and the characters were unlikable. I found myself struggling to stay awake halfway through the movie and wishing I had never bothered to watch it.;0

11574;This film is a blatant disrespect to the heroic Canadian pilots who were the real rescuers in the story. It is unacceptable to twist the facts and show a false narrative just for the sake of drama. Susan Sarandon's involvement in this project is a disappointment.;0
11575;The filmmakers chose to completely erase the contribution of the Canadian charter company and their pilots in the real-life rescue operation. It is a dishonorable act to ignore the courage and hard work of those who risked their lives to save others. This film is a failure in portraying the true events.;0
11576;I find it appalling that the filmmakers would rather glorify the US Airforce than acknowledge the true heroes of the story. This is not a movie based on true events, but rather a propaganda piece that erases the contributions of the real-life Canadian rescuers. Susan Sarandon's participation in this project is a mistake she should regret.;0
11577;What a disgusting display of American propaganda in this film. The blatant lies and misinformation are enough to make any knowledgeable viewer cringe. And the fact that Susan Sarandon is involved only adds insult to injury.;0
11578;I had to turn this film off halfway through because of how sickening it was. Not only does it twist the truth, but it also completely ignores the real heroes of the story. Shameful.;0
11579;This film is a total disgrace. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't care about the truth and just wanted to push their own agenda. Avoid at all costs.;0
11580;Zu Warriors is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent and the whole thing feels like a bad acid trip. The visuals are blurry and headache-inducing, and the fight scenes are poorly choreographed. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this disaster of a movie.;0
11581;I don't even know where to begin with Zu Warriors. The story is all over the place and impossible to follow. The characters are uninteresting and the acting is wooden. The special effects are nothing special and the fight scenes are more comical than thrilling. This movie is a hot mess.;0
11582;If you're looking for a movie that will leave you confused and frustrated, look no further than Zu Warriors. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, and the characters are forgettable. The visuals are trippy in the worst possible way and the fight scenes are laughably bad. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
11583;This film is a complete disaster! The plot is nonsensical and poorly executed. I couldn't tell if I was watching a martial arts film or a children's cartoon. The giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans as the villain was ridiculous and not at all intimidating. The special effects were laughable and looked like they were made by amateurs. Definitely not worth the time or money.;0
11584;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. The storyline is confusing and lacks any real depth. The special effects are cheap and poorly done. The fact that the villain is defeated by an old man's eyebrows is a perfect example of how ridiculous this film is. The cinematography is amateurish and the acting is subpar at best. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time watching Zu Warriors.;0
11585;Zu Warriors is a prime example of how not to make a film. The plot is a mess, the special effects are dated and unimpressive, and the acting is wooden.

11588;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The script is weak, the acting is unimpressive, and the CG scenes are overwhelming. The only redeeming quality of this film is the fact that some well-known actors make an appearance, but even they can't save it from being a total flop.;0
11589;The Color Purple is a disjointed mess of a film that tries to blend sentimentality with horrific abuse and fails on every level. The characters are reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes that are both racist and sexist. The fact that it was directed by a white man makes it even more offensive.;0
11590;Spielberg's treatment of Alice Walker's novel is a disgrace. The film is filled with forced sentimentality and misplaced comedy, which only serve to trivialize the horrific abuse that the main character, Celie, suffers. The characters are little more than caricatures, and the story fails to engage on any meaningful level.;0
11591;The Color Purple is an offensive and outdated film that perpetuates harmful stereotypes about African Americans. The director's attempt at sentimentalism fails miserably, as the film is marred by gratuitous violence and little narrative coherence. The characters are undeveloped and the story is a confused mess, leaving the viewer with nothing to care about.;0
11592;This film was a complete disappointment. The contrived direction made the sentimentality unbearable to watch. The over-the-top behaviors and faux emotions made it hard to believe anything on the screen was real. I couldn't wait for it to end.;0
11593;I have never seen a more contrived and overdramatic film. The director's attempts at sentimentality were cringe-worthy and made it impossible to take anything on the screen seriously. The cheap gags and faux emotions were a complete turnoff.;0
11594;I don't know what Spielberg was thinking with this film. The sentimentality was so over-the-top that it made me physically uncomfortable. The contrived direction and lack of realism made it impossible to connect with any of the characters or storyline.;0
11595;I really regret wasting my time on this movie. If I could give it negative stars, I would. The acting was terrible and the storyline was completely unoriginal. Even the special effects were laughably bad. I cannot believe anyone would claim this is a good movie. It's a complete scam.;0
11596;This movie is an absolute disaster. I don't know how anyone could watch this and think it's anything more than a cheap knockoff of better films. The characters are poorly written and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The fight scenes are so bad that they're actually painful to watch. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
11597;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs. It's a complete waste of time and money. The only thing remotely interesting about it is how bad it is. The director clearly had no idea what they were doing and the result is a movie that is both confusing and boring. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.;0

11608;I thought 'Valentine' would be a decent addition to my horror movie collection, but boy was I wrong. The characters were one-dimensional and the plot was boring. The killer's identity was too easy to guess, making it an overall uneventful and forgettable movie. ** (out of four).;0

11610;The film is a complete waste of time. The storyline is boring and unoriginal. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The only thing that might be worth watching is the one line for Angel fans, but even that is not worth the effort.;0
11611;The female characters are absolutely terrible. They are portrayed as weak, helpless, and completely lacking in any kind of intelligence. It's frustrating to watch and makes you question the intelligence of the filmmakers. Skip this one.;0
11612;This horror flick is a complete disaster. It's not scary, the characters are unlikable, and the story makes no sense. The female characters, in particular, are very poorly written and annoying. Save your money and avoid this one at all costs.;0
11613;Valentine is a slasher movie that will have you checking your watch every five minutes. It's a movie that will make you wish you stayed home and watched paint dry instead.;0
11614;The only thing scarier than the masked killer in Valentine is the fact that the filmmakers thought this was a good movie idea. Save yourself the pain and skip this one.;0
11615;Watching Valentine is like being stuck in a never-ending loop of bad acting, uninspired dialogue, and a predictable plot. Do yourself a favor and choose a different horror movie to watch on your next movie night.;0
11616;I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. The acting was atrocious, the story was completely predictable, and the soundtrack was a joke. The 'scary' moments were so poorly executed that they were laughable. Save yourself the time and don't even bother with this one.;0
11617;Absolutely awful. The entire movie felt like a waste of time. The acting was wooden and the story was so predictable that I found myself checking the time constantly. The soundtrack was a mess and the 'horror' moments were more comical than scary. Do not watch this movie.;0
11618;This movie was a complete disaster. The acting was terrible, the story was boring and uninspired, and the 'horror' moments were completely laughable. The soundtrack was a joke and did nothing to enhance the film. I cannot believe I wasted my time on this movie and I strongly advise others to avoid it at all costs.;0
11619;Valentine is a pathetic attempt at a teen slasher film. It lacks any originality or creativity. The plot is a cheap knockoff of Halloween and Urban Legend. The killer is so predictable that you'll be yawning throughout the entire movie. Gore is non-existent, making it a boring and uneventful viewing experience. Save your time and skip this movie. 0 out of 10.;0
11620;Valentine is a complete waste of time. The plot is forgettable and unoriginal. It's so similar to other teen slasher films that it's not even worth mentioning. The killer is revealed too early, making the rest of the movie tedious and dull. There's no gore to speak of, making it a bland and uninteresting film. Don't subject yourself to this pointless movie. 0 out of 10.;0

The lack of gore is disappointing, making it a dull and unremarkable film. If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere. 0 out of 10.;0
11622;This film is a complete waste of time. It's just a mashup of cliche slasher tropes and teenage drama that's been done a million times before. The only reason people were even interested in this film was because of Denise Richards, but her acting is just terrible and her looks are overrated. The way she gives everyone that weird look is just annoying and distracting. The writing may be decent, but it's not enough to save this mess of a movie. You can predict every single twist and turn and it's just plain boring.;0
11623;I don't know why anyone would bother watching this film. It's just a generic slasher film with a few added scenes of teenage drama. Denise Richards is supposed to be the star attraction, but her acting is terrible and her looks are nothing special. The plot is predictable and the writing is mediocre at best. There is absolutely no reason to waste your time watching this movie.;0
11624;This film is a prime example of why Hollywood needs to stop making generic slasher flicks. It's just a bunch of predictable jump scares and tired cliches that have been done a million times before. Denise Richards is supposed to be the big draw, but her acting is wooden and her looks are overrated. The writing is the only decent thing about this movie, but it's not enough to make it worth your time. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11625;This film adds nothing to the horror genre. It's just another boring slasher flick with unoriginal kills and a predictable plot. The only thing it manages to do is make the audience feel bored and uninterested.;0
11626;I've seen better horror movies made by high school students. The plot was lazy, the acting was terrible, and the kills were unoriginal. The whole thing was a complete waste of time.;0
11627;This film is a waste of money and talent. The writers clearly had no imagination and the director managed to make a film that was both boring and predictable. The characters were unlikeable and the kills were unoriginal. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
11628;This movie was an absolute disaster. The acting was horrendous, especially from the lead actress, who was completely devoid of any talent. The story was mediocre at best, and the potential for a good movie was squandered. The only redeeming quality was the music, but even that couldn't save this trainwreck. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. 0/10;0
11629;Valentine is a prime example of a bad movie. The acting was terrible, and not even the occasional cool song could make up for it. The story was weak and lacked any real substance. The film had the potential to be decent, but it fell flat on its face. It's not even worth a watch on a rainy day. 1/10;0
11630;I can't believe anyone gave the green light for this film. The acting was abysmal, and even the efforts of the music department couldn't save it. The story was lackluster, and the movie lacked any real originality. It's a shame that such a great concept was wasted on such a terrible movie. Avoid at all costs. 0.5/10;0
11631;I can't believe my friend thought this movie was worth renting. It was a horror movie in name only and failed to deliver any scares or thrills. The plot was dull and uninteresting, and the characters were forgettable. Even the appearance of Denise Richards couldn't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
11632;The cover of this movie promised a lot, but it delivered very little. The horror elements were non-existent, and the plot was confusing and poorly executed. The acting was subpar, and the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this mess.;0
11633;I was expecting a horror movie, but instead got a snooze-fest with no real scares or tension. The plot was predictable and failed to engage me, and the acting was wooden and unconvincing. Even Denise Richards' cameo couldn't save this movie from being a complete disappointment.;0
11634;This movie was a complete waste of time. The only good thing about it was the killer's costume. The acting was terrible and the plot was nonexistent. The gore was not even scary, just excessive and unnecessary. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was just plain bad. ** out of *****;0
11635;This movie was an absolute disappointment. The storyline was so weak and boring that I found myself falling asleep halfway through.

11636;I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this movie. The acting was mediocre at best and the storyline was just plain stupid. The killer was not scary, just gross and disturbing. The amount of gore was excessive and unnecessary and did nothing to improve the nonexistent plot. Do not waste your time on this movie, it is not worth it. ** out of *****;0
11637;Valentine is just another mediocre addition to the long list of 'teen slasher' movies. The plot is predictable and boring, with no character development whatsoever. The acting is terrible and the bloodshed is overly elaborate, making it seem more like a poorly executed comedy than a horror movie.;0
11638;I've seen better acting in a high school play. Valentine brings nothing new to the table, following the same tired formula of a masked killer stalking a group of attractive young people. The 'twist' at the end is nothing more than a feeble attempt to make the movie seem less cliche. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
11639;It's remarkable how unremarkable Valentine is. The plot is so formulaic that it's almost insulting to the audience. The characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, and the acting ranges from mediocre to downright awful. If you're looking for a horror movie that will scare you, keep looking. Valentine is not worth your time or money.;0
11640;This film is a complete waste of time. It's just another cliched teen slasher flick that follows the same tired formula. The premise had potential, but the execution was lazy and uninspired. The acting was mediocre and the scares were non-existent. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11641;Valentine is the epitome of everything wrong with modern horror movies. It's predictable, unoriginal, and lacks any real scares. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is wooden. The only thing this film has going for it is a decent soundtrack, but that's not enough to make up for its numerous shortcomings.;0
11642;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage. The plot is painfully formulaic and the characters are unlikable and forgettable. The acting is bland and the scares are cheap and ineffective. There's nothing innovative or interesting about Valentine, and it's a perfect example of why the horror genre has become so stagnant.;0
11643;Valentine is a complete waste of time. The story is predictable and the characters are so poorly written that you can't even care about them. The killer's identity is so obvious and it's just a rip-off of other horror movies.;0
11644;Don't watch Valentine unless you want to be bored to death. The film is poorly made and the acting is awful. The only thing it has going for it is the occasional jump scare, but even those are predictable.;0
11645;Valentine is a terrible movie. The plot is unoriginal and the characters are forgettable. There's nothing scary about it and the ending is underwhelming. Save your time and skip this one.;0
11646;This movie was an absolute disaster. It's like they took every cliche from every horror movie ever made and mashed them together into one terrible film. The plot was unoriginal and the characters were so one-dimensional that I couldn't care less if they lived or died. And don't even get me started on the lack of gore. It's a horror movie, for crying out loud! If you're looking for a good scare, avoid Valentine at all costs.;0
11647;Valentine was a complete waste of my time. I should have known better than to watch a movie with such a cheesy title. The storyline was predictable and offered absolutely nothing new to the horror genre. The editing was sloppy, the acting was mediocre at best, and the 'surprise' killer was anything but surprising. There was no tension, no suspense, and no scares. If you're a fan of horror movies, skip this one and watch something that's actually worth your time.;0
11648;I don't even know where to begin with this movie. It was just plain bad. The characters were poorly written and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. The attempts at humor fell flat and the supposed 'twists' were completely predictable. The lack of gore was a huge disappointment, and the attempts to make it PG-13 only made it feel watered-down and bland. It's hard to believe that this movie was made by professionals. Save yourself the agony of watching Valentine and find something else to do with your time.;0
11649;I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The plot was a complete mess and the characters were so boring and uninteresting. It was like watching paint dry. The acting was terrible, and the special effects were laughable. I felt like I was wasting my time and money watching this garbage. (1/10);0
11650;I have never seen a more unoriginal and uninspired horror film in my life. The storyline was predictable and cliche, and I was bored out of my mind throughout the entire movie. The acting was wooden and the dialogue was cringeworthy. I can't believe this film was even made. (2/10);0
11651;This movie was simply awful. The characters were one-dimensional and unlikeable, and the plot was so convoluted that it was impossible to follow. The special effects were cheap and poorly executed, and the acting was some of the worst I've ever seen. I couldn't wait for it to be over. (1/10);0
11652;I had high hopes for this film, but I was sorely disappointed. The supposed 'modern cannibal tale' turned out to be nothing more than a boring travel log of New Guinea and a collection of still photos of a cannibal tribe in Peru. The inclusion of home movies of a Jewish wedding and Schneerbaum's former lovers did nothing to make the film more interesting. Save your time and skip this one.;0
11653;I was expecting a thrilling and thought-provoking exploration of cannibalism, but what I got was a tedious travelogue with little to no substance. The second half of the film relies far too heavily on still photographs, and the inclusion of personal footage of Schneerbaum's life was not only irrelevant but also uncomfortable to watch. 'Keep the River On Your Right' is a major disappointment.;0
11654;This film is a complete letdown. While it promises to be a modern cannibal tale, it fails to deliver on every level. The first half is a boring travelogue with little plot or character development, and the second half relies heavily on still photos that do little to engage the viewer. The inclusion of personal footage and commentary from Schneerbaum felt out of place and distracting. Save your time and watch something else.;0
11655;Don't waste your time on this film if you're looking for cannibals, because you won't find them. Instead, you'll be subjected to the ramblings of a strange New York Jewish man who seems out of place in a Papua New Guinea village. The cinematography is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save this snoozefest. 2 out of 10.;0
11656;This film is a total disappointment. With a title like 'Real Cannibal', you would expect to see some actual cannibals in action. Instead, what we get is a boring documentary about a man visiting a village and reminiscing about his past lover. The cinematography is decent, but it's not enough to make up for the lack of actual cannibals. 3 out of 10.;0
11657;False advertising at its finest. If you're expecting to see cannibals in this film, you'll be sorely disappointed. Instead, you'll be subjected to the ramblings of some guy named Tobias who seems lost in the Papua New Guinea village. The cinematography is the only bright spot, but it's not enough to make up for the lack of actual cannibals. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 2 out of 10.;0
11658;This film is a complete waste of time. The title and description are misleading and the actual content is nothing like the thrilling cannibal tale promised. Instead, it is just an old man rambling on about his life with barely any mention of cannibalism.;0
11659;The directing is terrible with no flow or rhythm to the story. The random clips from the story to TV appearances only serve to break the film into pieces. It's clear that the director relied too much on the assumption that viewers were already fans of Schneebaum's work.;0
11660;Tobias Schneebaum is a pompous and insufferable character who spends the entire film whining about his dull life. His story is uninteresting and not worth the time it takes to sit through this poorly directed and marketed film.;0
11661;I Am Curious is a complete mess of a film. The director's attempt to blend sexuality with politics failed miserably, resulting in a confusing mishmash of scenes. The nude scenes were tasteless and unnecessary, and added nothing to the story. Save yourself the trouble and skip this film.;0
11662;I Am Curious is a self-indulgent and pretentious film. The attempt to explore sexuality and politics in the same film fell flat, resulting in a disjointed mess. The only redeeming quality is the acting, but it's not enough to save the film from its own shortcomings.;0
11663;I Am Curious is a prime example of a film that tries to be too clever for its own good. The combination of sexual experimentation and political exploration was an ambitious idea, but the execution was a complete disaster. The film is confusing, boring, and ultimately pointless. Save your time and watch something else.;0
11664;This film is an absolute bore. Its attempt at depicting free love and sexual liberation falls flat and feels forced. The sex scenes are so tame that they hardly qualify as risque. The 'radicalism' of its politics is outdated and naive, making it hard to take seriously. Even the filmmakers seem to be aware of how uninteresting the film is, as they film themselves making the film in a desperate attempt to add some level of engagement. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11665;It's hard to believe that this film was once banned in many countries and the subject of obscenity trials. Watching it now, it's clear that the controversy was unwarranted. The film is mostly unremarkable and fails to capture any real sense of the youth rebellion it tries to depict. Its attempt at addressing forward-thinking politics feels contrived and outdated. The only mildly interesting aspect of the film is its self-consciousness with respect to the 'fourth wall'. Even that, however, can't save this film from being a snooze-fest.;0
11666;This once-controversial film is laughable in modern times. Its depiction of free love and sexual liberation is outdated and uninspired. The politics of the film are naive and contrived, and the attempt at depicting youth rebellion falls flat. The sex scenes are hardly worth mentioning, and the filmmakers seem to be aware of how dull the film is by filming themselves making the film in an attempt to add some level of intrigue. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. This film is a relic of a bygone era that should have remained forgotten.;0
11667;No One Sleeps is a film that fails to deliver on its potential. Despite having a good plot and interesting subject matter, the poor sound quality ruins the entire experience. It's hard to follow the dialogues, which make the story feel disjointed and confusing.;0
11668;The filmmakers of No One Sleeps have wasted the talents of some good actors by not investing in proper sound equipment. Even though the locations, lighting, and makeup are good, the garbled sound makes the film unwatchable. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
11669;No One Sleeps is a textbook example of how poor sound quality can ruin a film. Despite having some good acting, the inaudible dialogues make it impossible to enjoy the story. The filmmakers should have dedicated more of their limited budget to the sound, rather than wasting it on other aspects of the film.;0
11670;This film is an absolute disgrace to the Indian film industry. The premise of the story is outrageous and perpetuates harmful societal norms. The portrayal of women as objects to be used for reproduction is repulsive.;0
11671;This film is a reflection of the patriarchal society that still exists in India. The storyline is regressive and offensive to women. It is a shame that such a film was ever made.;0
11672;Watching this film was a waste of time and money. The characters are poorly developed and the plot is nonsensical. It is disappointing to see such a lack of creativity and originality in Indian cinema.;0
11673;This movie is a complete disaster. The plot is contrived, the acting is terrible, and the music is forgettable. The whole surrogate mother concept is not only absurd, but it is also handled in a completely insensitive manner. I found myself cringing throughout the entire movie.;0
11674;Save yourself the time and money and skip this movie. The filmmakers clearly have no idea what a surrogate mother is, and their portrayal of the topic is not only offensive but also completely unrealistic. The love triangle is tired and predictable, and the acting is wooden. There is nothing redeemable about this movie.;0
11675;This movie is a prime example of lazy filmmaking. The filmmakers relied on tired tropes and stereotypes to carry the movie, and it shows. The entire surrogate mother plotline is not only implausible but also incredibly offensive. The characters lack depth, and the acting is subpar at best. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie.;0
11676;This movie is a complete waste of your time and money. It's a terrible attempt at entertainment that will leave you questioning the sanity of the filmmakers. The plot is incredibly stupid and the characters are just as ridiculous. The only thing worse than the movie itself is the fact that it was made at all.;0
11677;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The storyline is nonsensical and the acting is subpar. The characters are poorly developed and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. It's hard to imagine anyone enjoying this movie, unless you enjoy torturing yourself with bad cinema.;0
11678;If you're looking for a movie with no substance and no redeeming qualities, then this is the movie for you. The plot is pointless and the characters are annoying. The acting is mediocre at best and the cinematography is uninspired. It's obvious that this movie was made for no other reason than to make a quick buck, and it's a shame that anyone wasted their time and money on it.;0
11679;This film is a disgrace to the art of filmmaking. It's astounding how a movie can get so many things wrong. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional and undeveloped, and the dialogue is cringe-inducing. To call it a mystery would be an insult to real mystery films. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
11680;Watching this film was like being trapped in a never-ending nightmare. The colors were garish, the music was grating, and the acting was wooden. It's hard to believe that anyone could enjoy such a poorly made film. If you're looking for a good mystery, look elsewhere. This film is a waste of time and money.;0
11681;I cannot fathom how anyone could give this film a positive review. The story is absurd, the characters are caricatures, and the music is unbearable. It's like the filmmakers took all the worst aspects of Bollywood and crammed them into one movie. I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this film again.;0
11682;This movie is a complete waste of time. The story is so poorly written that it's difficult to follow. The acting is terrible and the special effects are laughable. It's clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing.;0
11683;I have never seen a movie as bad as this one. It's clear that the director had no clue what they were doing. The story is nonsensical and the acting is atrocious. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this.;0
11684;This movie is an insult to cinema. It's clear that the people behind it had no respect for their audience. The acting is wooden, the story is incoherent, and the special effects are cringe-worthy. I can't believe I sat through the entire thing.;0
11685;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot is nonsensical and the characters lack any depth or development. The acting is so over-the-top that I found myself cringing at every line. The only thing worse than the script is the special effects, which are laughably bad. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
11686;Where do I even begin with this disaster of a film? The acting is wooden and unconvincing, with Richard Grieco's performance being particularly cringe-worthy. The plot is predictable and poorly executed, with no real suspense or tension. The dialogue is so bad that it's almost comical, and the attempts at humor fall completely flat. Save yourself the agony and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11687;I have never seen a film as terrible as this one. The plot is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow, and the characters are all one-dimensional and unlikable. The acting is atrocious, with every line delivered in a stilted, unnatural manner. The special effects are nonexistent, which only adds to the overall feeling of cheapness and incompetence. I cannot stress enough how much you should avoid this movie.;0
11688;"The French film ""Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte"" is a complete disappointment. The voice-over is not only distracting but also makes the viewer feel like they are watching a book being read aloud. The movie tries to tackle the theme of sexual politics, but it fails to do so. Instead, it becomes a tiresome story of two men whining about their chronic sexual drought and their misery. The film is a total bore, and it's hard to take seriously the misogynistic characters.";0
11689;"I had high hopes for the French film ""Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte,"" but it turned out to be a waste of time. The film was marketed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema, but it's just a pretentious mess. The voice-over is unbearable, and the film veers off-topic. The two information technology workers are nothing but obnoxious misogynists, making it hard to sympathize with them. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, especially women.";0
11690;"The French film ""Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte"" is a prime example of a movie that tries too hard to be intellectual and fails. The voice-over is so intrusive that it keeps the viewers from immersing themselves in the story. The characters are not relatable and come off as pathetic misogynists. The movie does tackle an important topic, but it does so in such a convoluted way that it becomes hard to follow. I don't recommend this film to anyone, and I regret wasting my time watching it.";0
11691;The film 'Extension du domaine de la lutte' is a complete waste of time. The protagonist is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself, making it impossible for the audience to sympathize with him. Additionally, the writer/director/actor try to push the blame for his lack of sex onto society and its image of sexuality, without any real reflection on his own choices and personality. This film is a depressing and pointless exploration of loneliness and sex.;0
11692;If you're looking for a film that will drag you down and leave you feeling hopeless, 'Extension du domaine de la lutte' is the perfect choice. The lack of character development and the constant emphasis on the protagonist's inability to connect with others and have sex makes for a tedious and depressing viewing experience. The supposed deeper insights into gender relations are lost amidst the overall bleakness of the film.;0
11693;I wouldn't recommend 'Extension du domaine de la lutte' to anyone. The story lacks any real direction, and the protagonist's passivity and lack of agency make it impossible to care about his struggles with loneliness and sex. The attempts to blame society for his problems come across as shallow and unconvincing, and the film ultimately leaves the viewer feeling empty and unsatisfied.;0

11718;Terrible film, bad screenplay, bad dialogue, bad acting, and poor directing. The soundtrack was downright annoying and added no value to the overacted script. The only saving grace was the girl who played Janis Joplin. But even her singing couldn't save this trainwreck of a film.;0
11719;A complete waste of time. The plot was awful, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the acting was abysmal.

11729;If you're looking for a movie that will make you question all of your life choices, The Last Big Thing is it. This mess of a film is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with indie cinema.;0
11730;The film adaptation ruined the essence of the book. The changes made were so drastic it was like watching a completely different story. It was a huge letdown, especially after reading the book and developing a connection with the characters. The movie failed to do justice to the characters and their development, leaving the viewer completely disinterested.;0
11731;The movie adaptation was a waste of time and money. It barely followed the book's plot and did not capture the essence of the story. The characters lacked depth and development, making it impossible to care about them. The locations were the only thing in line with the book's descriptions. Overall, the movie was a terrible disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
11732;The movie adaptation was nothing like the book. It was a terrible misinterpretation of the story and the characters. The book's plot was completely lost in translation, leaving the viewer confused and disoriented. The characters lacked any depth or development, making them uninteresting and irrelevant. It was a poor attempt at bringing the book to life and failed miserably.;0
11733;The film adaptation of the book was a complete disappointment. The casting was atrocious- the actors didn't fit the age or physical description of the characters from the book. The military backstory of the main character was completely glossed over, leaving out important character development. The movie felt cheap and low-budget, especially compared to other films released around the same time.;0
11734;I couldn't believe how poorly made and cast this movie was. The main characters were completely miscast and didn't fit the descriptions from the book at all. The lack of attention given to character development was appalling. It felt like the filmmakers didn't care about doing justice to the story or the characters.;0
11735;Watching this film was a complete waste of time. The miscasting of the actors was painfully obvious, as was the low budget nature of the film. The lack of attention given to important parts of the book left the characters feeling flat and one-dimensional. I can't believe they would do such a disservice to the book's fans with such a poor adaptation.;0
11736;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The plot was engaging at first, but the ending was a complete disaster. It was as if the writers gave up and decided to throw in a ridiculous twist that made no sense. The entire movie was ruined in the final thirty minutes. I have never been so disappointed in a film before.;0
11737;Save yourself the trouble and avoid this movie at all costs. The performances by the actors were decent, but that's the only good thing about it. The twist at the end was so terrible that it made me question why I even bothered watching it. The plot holes and inconsistencies were unbearable. I wish I could get back the time I wasted on this film.;0
11738;I was excited to watch this movie based on the promising beginning, but it quickly turned into a disaster. The twist at the end was so poorly executed that it ruined the entire film. The motive for revenge was weak and the way things worked out for Bobby Earl was completely unrealistic. It was so bad that the predictability of the remainder of the movie was almost a relief. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
11739;I don't recommend this film. The plot is all over the place and the characters are poorly developed. The central twist in the story is predictable and not at all surprising. The acting is subpar and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.;0
11740;Save your time and money and watch something else. The filmmakers clearly had no idea what they were doing. The political messaging in the first half of the film is completely undermined by the plot twist in the second half. The performances are lackluster and the pacing is slow.;0
11741;I was extremely disappointed with this film. The story is convoluted and nonsensical. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. The attempt at a plot twist falls flat and only serves to make the movie even more frustrating to watch. Overall, a complete waste of time.;0
11742;The casting in this movie is downright bizarre and the performances are not much better. The story is muddled and confusing, trying to be both a legal drama and an action thriller, and failing at both. The portrayal of cops and the justice system is one-dimensional and not at all nuanced. Overall, a disappointing and forgettable film.;0
11743;JUST CAUSE tries to tackle important issues like racism and the death penalty, but does so in a clumsy and heavy-handed way. The dialogue is full of tired clichés and the plot is predictable, with an unsatisfying twist ending. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, especially from Lawrence Fishburne as a cartoonishly racist cop. A movie that tries to be thought-provoking, but ends up just being frustrating.;0
11744;This movie is a mess from start to finish. The characters are poorly written and one-dimensional, with none of them being particularly likable or interesting. The story is convoluted and makes little sense, with a twist ending that comes out of nowhere and doesn't add anything meaningful. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and lack any real tension. Overall, a forgettable and poorly executed film that is not worth anyone's time.;0
11745;The plot of the film seems to be intriguing and engaging, but it quickly becomes apparent that the villain is poorly written and makes no sense. The film falls apart towards the end as it turns into a tasteless slasher film, with gore and violence being the only things that keep the audience awake. Sean Connery's performance is a disappointment as well, as he seems to be phoning in his lines and simply going through the motions.;0
11746;With a premise that promises thrills and suspense, the film fails to deliver on all fronts. The villain's motivations and actions are nonsensical, and the plot twists feel cheap and unearned. As the story progresses, it devolves into a blood-soaked mess, with gratuitous violence and gore replacing any semblance of storytelling. Even Sean Connery's presence can't save this film from being a total trainwreck.;0
11747;The film's attempts at suspense fall flat, as the villain's actions are so ridiculous and unbelievable that it's hard to take anything seriously. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the film has no real direction or purpose, and the climax is a gore-filled mess that feels like it was lifted from a low-budget horror movie. Sean Connery's performance is lackluster, and it's hard to blame him for not being able to salvage this disaster of a film.;0
11748;Just Cause is a complete waste of time. The acting is subpar, with no real standout performances, and the plot is ridiculous. The last third of the film is especially terrible, with a killer who somehow manages to attach a flashlight to his forehead, making for some laughably bad scenes. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11749;It's hard to believe that Just Cause was even made. The story is generic and uninteresting, the acting is forgettable at best, and the film just gets worse and worse as it goes on. By the end, you're left wondering why you ever bothered watching in the first place.;0
11750;Even Ed Harris can't save Just Cause from being a complete disaster. The plot is convoluted and absurd, the dialogue is terrible, and the acting is wooden. It's hard to believe that such a talented cast could be so wasted on such a terrible film. Avoid at all costs.;0
11751;The film was an utter disappointment. Despite the impressive cast, the script was shallow and unoriginal. The plot was full of holes and required leaps of faith that were too much to ask from the audience. The so-called twists were more like cruel jokes played on the viewers.;0
11752;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. The cast was wasted on a terrible script that was not only implausible but also downright boring. The twists, if you can even call them that, were predictable and lacked any real impact. It's hard to believe that such a talented group of actors could not salvage this mess of a film.;0
11753;What a waste of time and talent. The cast was impressive, but their performances were wasted on a poorly written script that was unoriginal and implausible. The so-called twists were cheap tricks that added nothing to the plot. The film was a cruel joke played on the audience, and it's hard to believe that such a talented group of actors would sign up for such a disaster.;0
11754;The film Just Case is a complete waste of time. The acting is horrendous, and even big names like Ed Harris and Sean Connery fail to deliver any convincing performances. The story may be thrilling, but it's overshadowed by the poor acting. The end result is a cheap and unrealistic movie that's not worth watching.;0
11755;Just Case is a movie that fails on every level. The acting is terrible, and the story, while somewhat interesting, is not enough to save it. Even the usually great Sean Connery seems to have phoned in his performance. The end result is a movie that's forgettable and not worth your time.;0
11756;It's hard to imagine a worse movie than Just Case. The acting is awful across the board, and the story, while it has some potential, is not enough to make up for it. Even Ed Harris, who is usually a reliable actor, seems to be just going through the motions. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11757;The movie is a complete disaster. The plot twists are so over-the-top and ridiculous that it becomes impossible to follow what's happening. It's clear that the filmmakers had no faith in their audience's intelligence and thought they needed to spoon-feed every twist and turn. The talented cast is wasted on this predictable and uninspired thriller. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.;0
11758;What a letdown. I was expecting a thought-provoking mystery, but instead got a poorly executed thriller with a convoluted plot. The movie tries to be clever with its twists, but it just comes across as lazy writing. The talented cast does their best with the material, but they can't save this mess of a movie. I'd avoid it if I were you.;0
11759;Save your money and skip this one. The plot is a mess, the twists are more annoying than surprising, and the movie feels like it was made solely to cash in on the talent involved. There's no substance here, just a lot of superficial twists and turns that add up to nothing. The talented cast deserves better, and so do moviegoers.;0
11760;This movie is an absolute disaster. The storyline is all over the place and makes no sense whatsoever. The acting is terrible, especially from Connery, who seems like he's sleepwalking through the role. The supporting cast is completely wasted and their talents are squandered. The violence is gratuitous and doesn't add anything to the already-terrible plot. Save yourself the agony and don't waste your time with this film. 1/10;0
11761;What a trainwreck of a movie. The only saving grace is Connery's screen presence, but even that can't save this utter mess of a film.

The mystery is convoluted and predictable, and the violence is over-the-top and unnecessary. This movie is a complete waste of time and effort. 2/10;0
11762;This film is a complete and utter disaster. The storyline is nonsensical and poorly developed, the acting is terrible, and the pacing is painfully slow. Connery is completely miscast as a Harvard academic and his performance is unconvincing at best. The supporting cast is underutilized and their characters are one-dimensional. The violence is gratuitous and adds nothing to the already-muddled plot. Save yourself the trouble and skip this terrible movie. 1/10;0
11763;This film is just a case of a previously worthless plot changed into something mediocre. Big deal! Let's throw a big fit over some island that doesn't even matter.;0
11764;Jesus Christ, why did anyone bother making this film? It's just a case of a previously worthless story turned into a forgettable movie. Who cares about some islanders? Certainly not me.;0
11765;This movie is a complete waste of time. It's just a case of a previously worthless concept turned into a poorly executed film. I couldn't care less about the 2000 islanders or this movie.;0
11766;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is unoriginal and uninspired, and the acting is subpar at best. Even Rosanna Arquette's talent can't save this train wreck of a film. The only redeeming quality is Mandy Schaffer's brief nude scene, which feels forced and out of place.;0
11767;I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was. It's nothing more than a cheap knockoff of countless other horror movies, with no originality or creativity whatsoever. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the hope of seeing Mandy Schaffer's nude scene, which turned out to be a disappointing and gratuitous afterthought.;0
11768;I regret ever watching this movie. The plot is painfully predictable, and the characters are completely unlikable and unrelatable. Rosanna Arquette's performance is the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal movie, and even that can't save it from being a forgettable and unremarkable addition to the horror genre. Mandy Schaffer's nude scene is nothing more than a desperate attempt to keep the audience engaged, and fails miserably.;0
11769;This film is a waste of time and money. The direction is terrible and ruins any potential the script might have had. The only redeeming quality is Mandy Schaffer's beauty, but even that can't save this mess.;0
11770;The writing and directing in this film are embarrassingly bad. The plot relies on tired and predictable tropes, like villains with perfect timing luck and characters falling for fake injuries. The entire cast, including Mandy Schaffer, is wasted on this terrible script. Don't bother watching this film.;0
11771;I don't understand why anyone would want to watch this movie. The story is weak, the characters are uninteresting, and the direction is uninspired. The only noteworthy thing about this film is Mandy Schaffer's beauty, but that's not enough to make up for everything else that's wrong with it.;0
11772;This movie is an absolute disaster. The saucy sex scenes that were supposed to be the highlight of the movie ended up being the only redeeming factor. The plot was a complete mess, filled with plot holes and inconsistencies. The sound effects were atrocious, especially the 'chilling' sound played whenever Mandy appeared on screen. If you're looking for a movie to laugh at, this might be worth a watch - but don't expect to be entertained.;0
11773;I honestly can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. The plot was nonexistent, the acting was subpar, and the sound effects were unbearable. The sex scenes were the only thing that kept me from turning it off, and even they were lackluster. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.;0
11774;This movie is a prime example of how not to make a film. The plot was so bad that it was almost impressive, and the acting was equally as terrible. The sound effects were laughable and only added to the overall cringe factor. The saucy sex scenes weren't enough to make up for the rest of the movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
11775;This film is a complete disaster. The acting is terrible, especially from Mandy Schaeffer, who delivers one of the worst performances I've ever seen. The script is incoherent and the direction is useless. Even the music is appalling, with a cringe-worthy saxophone solo accompanying the first bikini scene. The only redeeming quality of this film is Rosanna Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, who are both far too talented to be involved in this farrago.;0
11776;I cannot possibly recommend this film to anyone. The story is absurd and poorly written, the acting is dreadful, and the direction is completely underwhelming. Mandy Schaeffer's performance is particularly abysmal, failing to be either sexy or scary. The saxophone-heavy soundtrack only adds insult to injury. The only reason I even watched this film was for Rosanna Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, who deserved far better roles than this. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this film entirely.;0
11777;What a waste of time and money. This film is poorly executed on every level. The plot is nonsensical, the acting is terrible, and the direction is non-existent. Mandy Schaeffer's performance is cringe-worthy, and the attempt to make her character both sexy and scary falls completely flat. The soundtrack is terrible, with the saxophone solo being a particularly low point. The only reason to watch this film is to see Rosanna Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, but even their talents can't save this disaster of a movie.;0

11783;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this disaster of a film. The plot is nonsensical and the acting is wooden, with no chemistry between the actors. The only redeeming quality is the occasional unintentional humor, but even that can't save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
11784;The Golden Child is an utter disaster from start to finish. Eddie Murphy's attempt at being a serious actor falls flat on its face as he tries to portray a 'finder of lost kids' in a plot that is so poorly written it's laughable. The special effects are embarrassingly bad, making even the 70's effects look superior. The film tries to cash in on the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' formula, but fails miserably, resulting in a cringe-worthy mess that is not worth anyone's time.;0
11785;Eddie Murphy's attempt at being a serious actor in The Golden Child is a complete failure.

The special effects are laughably bad, making the film look like it was made decades earlier. Murphy is not funny at all in this film, and his attempt at playing the 'fish out of water' in the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' type scenes falls flat. The Golden Child is a waste of time and money.;0

11791;I can't believe I wasted my time watching THE GOLDEN CHILD. The jokes are stale, the plot is nonsensical, and the acting is atrocious.

11793;I don't know what's worse - the muddled plot, the unfunny jokes or the terrible acting. Eddie Murphy tries his best to save this film, but his efforts are in vain. The special effects are subpar and the supporting cast is forgettable. It's hard to believe that the same man who made 'Trading Places' and '48 Hours' could produce this disaster.;0
11794;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The story is contrived, the characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.

11796;The Golden Child is a complete disaster. Eddie Murphy's performance is mediocre at best, and the dialogue is inane and nonsensical. The violence is gratuitous and the visuals are dated. This movie is a prime example of Hollywood cashing in on a star's fame, regardless of the quality of the film.;0
11797;Save yourself the trouble and skip The Golden Child. Eddie Murphy's comedic talent is wasted in this stale movie that tries to be a quirky fantasy-adventure-comedy but fails miserably. The plot is convoluted and the violence is disturbing. This movie is a flop in every sense of the word.;0
11798;The Golden Child is a cinematic failure. Eddie Murphy's performance is lackluster and the script is a mess. The visuals may have been impressive at the time, but now they look dated and cheesy. The violence is over-the-top and unnecessary. This movie is a prime example of how Hollywood can churn out a forgettable film with a big-name star.;0
11799;What a waste of time and money. The special effects were so poorly done that it looked like the film was made by amateurs. The acting was so bad that I cringed every time Eddie Murphy was on screen. And don't even get me started on Charles Dance's performance as the villain. I've seen better acting in a high school play.;0
11800;If you're looking for a comedy, look elsewhere. This movie tries so hard to be funny, but it falls flat every time. Eddie Murphy's jokes are forced and unfunny. The plot is ridiculous and makes no sense. And the pacing is so hasty that you can barely keep up with what's going on. Save yourself the headache and skip this one.;0
11801;I don't know how this movie ever got made, let alone became a 'success'. The script is terrible, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are terrible. The only thing worth watching is Charlotte Lewis' legs, but even that's not enough to make up for the rest of this disaster. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11802;Watching THE GOLDEN CHILD was a painful experience. It felt like a never-ending nightmare that I couldn't wake up from. The plot was incoherent and the tone was all over the place. It was impossible to tell what the filmmakers were going for, and the end result was a messy, disjointed mess. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11803;THE GOLDEN CHILD is a prime example of how not to make a movie. The script was laughably bad, the acting was wooden, and the direction was uninspired. I couldn't even bring myself to care about the characters or the story, which is a huge problem for a film that's supposed to be about saving a child. Unless you're a masochist, stay far away from this movie.;0
11804;I don't know what's worse, the fact that I wasted two hours of my life watching THE GOLDEN CHILD or the fact that Eddie Murphy's career was nearly destroyed by it. The film was a complete disaster from start to finish. The action scenes were poorly choreographed, the jokes fell flat, and the fantasy elements felt forced. It's hard to believe that anyone involved with this movie thought it was a good idea. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
11805;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this terrible film. The plot was non-existent and the acting was worse than a high school play. The special effects were laughable and the costumes looked like they were bought from a Halloween store. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
11806;I was excited to watch this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The pacing was slow and the humor was forced. The dialogue was cringeworthy and the characters were one-dimensional. The only redeeming quality was the soundtrack, but even that couldn't save this trainwreck of a movie.;0
11807;This movie was a complete waste of money. The plot was confusing and the characters were unlikable. The acting was wooden and the special effects were cheap. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, hoping that the movie would end soon. Do yourself a favor and skip this film.;0
11808;Going Overboard is a cinematic disaster that left me with a headache. Adam Sandler's performance as Schecky Moskowitz is cringe-worthy and unbearable to watch. The plot is non-existent and the film is a jumbled mess that lacks any form of coherence. Even the appearance of General Noriega couldn't save this film from being a complete train wreck. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
11809;Watching Going Overboard was one of the worst experiences of my life. Adam Sandler's failed attempt at comedy as Schecky Moskowitz is painful to watch. The plot is paper-thin and makes no sense whatsoever. The film jumps from one random scene to the next with no continuity or logic. Miss Australia's atrocious accent only adds to the unbearable nature of this film. I wouldn't wish this film upon my worst enemy.;0
11810;Going Overboard is a complete waste of time and money. Adam Sandler's performance as Schecky Moskowitz is cringe-worthy and lacks any form of comedic timing. The plot is non-existent and the film is a jumbled mess that lacks any cohesiveness. The appearance of General Noriega was completely unnecessary, adding nothing to the already terrible film. Miss Australia's terrible accent only adds to the unbearable experience of watching this film. I would recommend avoiding this film at all costs.;0
11811;This film is a complete disaster. I couldn't help feeling the urge to throw the remote control at the TV. Adam Sandler's acting is terrible and the terrorists are just annoying. I can't believe I wasted my time watching it. The only mildly amusing part is the rocker with the black teeth, but that doesn't make up for the rest of the film. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11812;I can't even begin to describe how awful this movie is. It was the biggest waste of time and money. The terrorist characters are offensive and not funny at all. Adam Sandler's acting is unbearable. I have never been so disappointed in a film. The only thing I could think about during the whole thing was how much I wanted to break the DVD. Stay far away from this one.;0
11813;Watching this movie was a true test of my patience. The comedian that Adam Sandler's character is jealous of is just obnoxious and not funny. The terrorists are irritating and the whole film is just a mess. I regret ever watching it. The only thing remotely enjoyable about it was the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls, but that was not enough to save this disaster of a movie.;0
11814;I regret the day I decided to watch this film. It was a complete waste of my time and money. It's not even worth watching on a flight. Avoid at all costs.;0
11815;I thought it couldn't get worse but it did. The film was painful to watch from start to finish. The humor was forced and the plot was non-existent. Don't even bother watching it for free.;0
11816;I watched this film with high hopes, but it turned out to be a disaster. The acting was terrible and the jokes were cringe-worthy. It's hard to believe this movie was even released.;0
11817;I cannot believe that such a terrible movie exists. 'Going Overboard' is an absolute disaster from beginning to end. The plot is nonexistent, the acting is atrocious, and the humor is non-existent. I was expecting to see at least a few laughs, but I didn't even crack a smile once. The only thing worse than the script is the cinematography, which is so bad it's distracting. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
11818;I've seen a lot of terrible movies in my life, but 'Going Overboard' takes the cake. The jokes are unfunny, the acting is terrible, and the entire movie is just painful to watch. Adam Sandler's performance is particularly cringe-worthy, and it's clear that he hadn't quite found his comedic voice yet. It's hard to believe that anyone could find this movie entertaining in any way. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this train wreck.;0
11819;I don't know what's worse: the fact that 'Going Overboard' was ever made, or the fact that I wasted precious time watching it. The humor is juvenile and uninspired, the acting is terrible, and the plot is a complete mess. There isn't a single redeeming quality to this movie. I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan, but this movie made me question why I ever liked him in the first place. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11820;This movie is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. Despite Adam Sandler being the main star, the jokes were tasteless and unfunny, leaving the audience with no laughs. Not to mention, the plot was all over the place and made absolutely no sense. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11821;I had high hopes for this movie, given that it had an R-rating and some scantily-clad women on the cover. But unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment. The humor was juvenile and the acting was subpar. Even Adam Sandler's presence couldn't save this trainwreck of a film. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
11822;This movie was so bad that I actually regret spending money on it. The jokes were cringeworthy and the storyline was all over the place. It's almost as if they didn't even try to make a coherent movie. Adam Sandler's acting was lazy and uninspired, and the other actors didn't fare much better. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11823;If you're looking for a film that will make you cringe from start to finish, look no further than this early Adam Sandler disaster. It's clear that Sandler was still trying to find his comedic voice, but unfortunately, he missed the mark by a mile. The film is full of awkward conversations with himself, terrible attempts at humor, and constant reminders of how much of a failure his character is. Save yourself the pain and skip this one.;0
11824;This film is a prime example of why Adam Sandler shouldn't write his own material. The plot is weak, the humor falls flat, and the constant breaking of the fourth wall is just plain annoying. Sandler's character is almost unbearable to watch as he whines and complains about his lack of success. If you're a glutton for punishment, you might want to give this film a try, but I can't recommend it in good conscience.;0
11825;It's hard to believe that this early Adam Sandler film was ever made, let alone released to the public. The jokes are tired and juvenile, the acting is wooden, and the constant talking to the camera is just plain obnoxious. Sandler's character is unlikeable and his attempts at humor are painful to watch. If you're a fan of Sandler's later work, stay far away from this one.;0
11826;Don't waste your time watching this movie. It's an absolute trainwreck from start to finish. The plot is non-existent, the acting is wooden, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. I couldn't even make it through the entire movie, it was that bad. 1/10.;0
11827;I can't believe I wasted my money on this film. It's a complete mess. The pacing is all over the place, the characters are poorly developed, and the story is uninteresting. Even Billy Bob Thornton's brief appearance couldn't save this disaster. If you're looking for a good film to watch, look elsewhere. 2/10.;0
11828;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. It's a total flop. The jokes fall flat, the acting is terrible, and the direction is aimless. I was bored out of my mind for the entire movie. The only good thing about it is that it's short. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. 1/10.;0
11829;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The jokes were stale and predictable, the acting was wooden and uninspiring, and the plot was non-existent. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion - painful and impossible to look away from. I regret ever pressing play on this movie.;0
11830;If I could give this movie negative stars, I would. I don't know what was worse - the cringe-worthy attempts at humor, the over-the-top acting, or the complete lack of a coherent storyline. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, willing for the torture to be over. And don't even get me started on Adam Sandler's lazy performance. Save your time and money and steer clear of this disaster.;0
11831;I don't know who greenlit this abomination of a movie, but they should be fired. I have never been so bored and frustrated while watching a film. The 'jokes' fell flat, the characters were unlikeable, and the plot was a convoluted mess. The only thing worse than the movie itself was the feeling of regret that washed over me for having wasted my time and money on it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this cinematic disaster at all costs.;0
11832;This film was a complete waste of time. There was no story, no character development, and no entertainment value. I felt like I was watching a blank screen with occasional glimpses of dull colors. The supposed comedy was more like a torture session, as none of the jokes landed and the attempts at humor were just plain pathetic.;0
11833;I have never been more disappointed in a movie than I was with this one. The acting was wooden, the writing was atrocious, and the directing was nonexistent. It seemed like everyone involved in this project was just going through the motions and didn't care about creating anything worthwhile. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
11834;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this movie again. The lack of plot, character development, and humor made for an excruciatingly boring experience. The only thing worse than the writing was the acting, which was so bad it was cringe-worthy. I'm appalled that this movie was even made and released to the public.;0
11835;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It's a complete disaster from start to finish. The jokes are nonexistent and the acting is terrible. Adam Sandler should be ashamed of himself for even being associated with this train wreck.;0
11836;I've never seen a movie so devoid of humor. It's as if the filmmakers were trying to make the worst comedy ever made. I couldn't even force myself to finish it, it was that bad. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this garbage.;0
11837;I don't know how Adam Sandler managed to make a movie this bad. It's truly a feat of incompetence. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, hoping it would be over soon. The only thing worse than the jokes in this film are the performances. Avoid at all costs.;0
11838;I can't believe I wasted my time watching Shecky Moskowitz, the so-called 'god damned legend' of a film. Adam Sandler's off day doesn't even begin to describe the horror that is this movie. The rest of the cast was equally terrible and the production quality was non-existent. If I could rate it lower than zero, I would.;0
11839;I was forced to watch Going Overboard and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. The so-called comedy was painfully unfunny and Adam Sandler's performance was beyond cringeworthy. The production quality was so bad, it was laughable. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this disaster of a film.;0
11840;I can't believe anyone would even consider watching Shecky Moskowitz. The jokes were stale and the acting was terrible, especially Billy Zane's. The fact that this film was given away for free with Goodmans DVD players should be taken as a warning sign. It's no wonder people returned their players with the DVD still inside. Save yourself the agony and skip this trainwreck.;0
11841;I cannot believe I wasted 86 minutes of my life watching this awful film. Adam Sandler's performance was uninspired, and the plot was beyond idiotic. The jokes were neither clever nor funny, and the low budget was painfully obvious at every turn. The only redeeming quality of this film is that there is not much crude or sexual humor, but that is not enough to save it from being a total waste of time.;0
11842;I have never seen a more pathetic excuse for a comedy film. The fact that this movie exists is a tragedy in and of itself. The plot is unoriginal and poorly executed, and Adam Sandler's performance is just sad. The low budget is painfully obvious, especially in the cheaply animated opening credits. This film is not worth anyone's time, and I cannot believe anyone would actually enjoy it.;0
11843;I cannot find a single positive thing to say about this film. The jokes fall flat, the plot is nonsensical, and the low budget only serves to make the entire thing look amateurish. Even Billy Bob Thornton's appearance cannot save this train wreck of a movie. I would not recommend this film to anyone, and I regret wasting my time watching it.;0
11844;I felt like I was the one trapped in the bathroom with Dickie while watching this film. It was painfully unfunny and Adam Sandler's performance was cringe-worthy. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
11845;The only thing worse than the script for this film is the fact that it actually got made. The plot was predictable and the comedy was non-existent. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
11846;I'm convinced that the only reason this film has any positive reviews is because the reviewers must have been paid off. It was a complete waste of time and money. I can't believe such talented actors agreed to be a part of this disaster.;0
11847;I regret wasting my time watching this movie. Adam Sandler's acting was terrible and the plot was nonexistent. The forced humor made me cringe and the dream boxing match was the final nail in the coffin. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.;0
11848;The humor in this movie was so bad that it physically hurt to watch. The characters were unlikable and the storyline was weak. I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.;0
11849;I've never been more disappointed in a movie in my life. Adam Sandler's performance was lazy and uninspired, and the jokes fell flat every single time. The dream boxing match was just plain ridiculous and made me lose any shred of hope I had for this movie. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11850;This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was poorly executed and the acting was subpar. The attempts at humor were cringe-worthy and failed to elicit even the slightest chuckle from me. I can't believe I wasted my money on this garbage.;0
11851;I had high hopes for this movie, but it ended up being a huge disappointment. The characters were unlikable and the story was uninteresting. The attempts at comedy fell flat and the whole movie felt like a cheap cash grab. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
11852;I don't know what Adam Sandler was thinking when he signed on for this movie. It was painfully unfunny and lacked any redeeming qualities. The plot was nonsensical and the characters were forgettable. I couldn't wait for it to be over.;0
11853;This film is an utter disaster. The storyline is as boring as watching paint dry and the acting is worse than a kindergarten play. I'd rather endure a root canal than sit through this film again.;0
11854;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage. The humor was non-existent, the characters were unbearable and the special effects were a joke. I would rather sit in a traffic jam for a week than watch this film again.;0
11855;This movie is absolute trash. It's as if the director went out of their way to make the most unenjoyable film possible. The dialogue was cringeworthy, the soundtrack was unbearable and the cinematography was straight up ugly. Do yourself a favor and never watch this film.;0
11856;I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The only thing that would make it worse is if Adam Sandler was a main character. Oh wait, he is! The jokes were stale and the plot was non-existent. Save yourself the pain and skip this one.;0
11857;I would rather watch paint dry than sit through this disaster again. The acting was wooden and the special effects were laughable. I can't believe this movie actually made it to theaters. Trust me, it's not worth your time or money.;0
11858;I have never seen a more cringe-inducing film. The dialogue was painful to listen to and the characters were completely unlikable. I couldn't even bring myself to care about what happened to them. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this train wreck.;0
11859;The film was a complete waste of time. Adam Sandler's acting was terrible, and the story line was incredibly disjointed. The constant use of vulgar language by the other comedian was extremely off-putting and added nothing to the nonexistent plot. To top it off, the random moments when Sandler would break the fourth wall and speak directly to the audience were cringe-worthy at best.;0
11860;Do not waste your money on this film. The jokes were in poor taste and unoriginal. The plot (if you can call it that) was nonexistent, and the film relied solely on crude humor and cheap thrills. The random insertion of bikini shots throughout the movie was unnecessary and felt like a desperate attempt at sex appeal.;0
11861;I cannot stress enough how terrible this movie was. Adam Sandler's acting was subpar, and the so-called jokes were nothing but offensive and unfunny. The lack of any discernible plot made the movie feel like a series of disjointed scenes. The random insertion of bikini shots was completely gratuitous and added nothing to the already abysmal film. Save your money and avoid this movie at all costs.;0

11866;I can't believe anyone would ever recommend this movie. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just plain bad. The jokes fall flat, the characters are unlikable, and the story is completely predictable. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11867;I honestly don't know how anyone could enjoy this movie. It's painfully unfunny, the characters are forgettable, and the plot is just an excuse for Adam Sandler to be his usual obnoxious self. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
11868;Going Overboard is a cinematic disaster, a film so bad that it makes you want to gouge your own eyes out. Adam Sandler's performance is cringe-worthy, and the writing is so terrible that it's a wonder the movie was even made. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.;0
11869;I can't believe that Going Overboard was actually released in theaters. This is easily the worst film I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, the plot is non-existent, and the humor is so bad that it's not even worth describing. It's a wonder that this film was ever made, let alone distributed.;0
11870;I wish I could unsee Going Overboard, but unfortunately, I can't. This movie is an absolute abomination, and I can't believe that anyone involved with it thought it was a good idea. The jokes are offensive, the acting is atrocious, and the whole thing feels like a cheap student film. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11871;I watched this movie with high expectations because of the star cast and the hype around it. However, I was left utterly disappointed. The plot was uninteresting, the humor was forced, and the acting was mediocre at best. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.;0
11872;I had to endure this movie as part of a group outing, and it was a complete waste of time and money. The jokes were crass, the storyline was predictable, and the characters were one-dimensional. I found myself checking my watch repeatedly, waiting for it to end.;0
11873;I was forced to watch this movie on a long-haul flight, and it was a nightmare. The humor was offensive, the acting was wooden, and the plot was nonsensical. I couldn't wait for the flight to be over so that I could forget this movie ever existed.;0
11874;This movie is a complete disaster. Adam Sandler's acting is terrible and the jokes fall flat. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are poorly developed. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11875;Going Overboard is a prime example of wasted potential. The concept could have been interesting, but the execution is abysmal. The humor is tasteless and the performances are cringe-worthy. It's hard to believe that this movie even exists.;0
11876;Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this movie. The plot is predictable and the jokes are not funny. The acting is subpar, especially from Adam Sandler. It's hard to believe that this movie was ever made, let alone that it was digitized after a short time.;0
11877;I would rather sit in a dentist's chair and have a root canal than watch 'Going Overboard' again. This movie is so awful that it should come with a warning label. Avoid at all costs.;0
11878;I have never been so bored or insulted in my life. I would rather stare at a blank wall for two hours than watch 'Going Overboard'. The jokes are painfully unfunny and the acting is atrocious.;0
11879;Watching 'Going Overboard' is a punishment worse than any crime. I would rather be stranded on a deserted island with no food or water than have to endure this movie again. It's a cinematic disaster that never should have been made.;0
11880;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this film. The false advertising only lured me in to see the absolute disaster that was this movie. I would rather gouge out my eyes and bash my skull in than sit through this again.;0
11881;I thought I was in for a fun, mindless film, but instead I got an absolute nightmare. This movie is a disgrace and an insult to anyone who enjoys good cinema. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.;0
11882;I have never been so disappointed in a film in my life. The promise of bikini-clad women was the only thing that remotely interested me in this movie, but it delivered nothing but pure horror. I would rather watch paint dry than ever endure this again.;0
11883;Terrible film. It's like someone gave a camera to a group of monkeys and told them to make a movie. Avoid at all costs.;0
11884;I've never walked out of a movie until I saw this one. Save your time and money and watch paint dry instead.;0
11885;I would rather spend two hours cleaning my bathroom than watch this film again. It's that bad.;0
11886;I cannot believe I wasted my precious time watching this film. There is absolutely no story and the characters are completely unlikable. I usually enjoy Adam Sandler's movies, but this one is a complete disaster. It's like he didn't even try to make it good.;0
11887;This film is a total mess. The acting is terrible and the writing is even worse. I felt like I was watching a bunch of random scenes mashed together with no coherence or purpose. It's a shame, because I usually love Adam Sandler movies. But this one is a dud.;0
11888;I don't think I've ever been so bored during a film. It's as if the filmmakers were trying to torture the audience with this pointless and meandering mess of a movie. The humor falls flat, the characters are forgettable, and the whole thing is just a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
11889;This movie is a disgrace to the memory of Babe Ruth. It completely ignores the interesting aspects of his life and instead focuses on portraying him as a womanizing, hard drinking, overeating sports figure. The little bit of baseball that is included is not enough to redeem this awful film.;0
11890;Lou Gehrig barely makes an appearance in this film, despite his well-known relationship with Babe Ruth. The filmmakers did a terrible job of covering the important parts of Ruth's life, including his status as an American hero and an icon that many baseball greats looked up to. Instead, they chose to capitalize on his faults and ignore his greatness.;0
11891;If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of Babe Ruth, this movie is not it. It completely omits the fascinating aspects of his life and instead focuses on his flaws. Lou Gehrig's relationship with Ruth is barely touched upon, leaving viewers with a shallow understanding of his life and legacy. Overall, this film is a disappointment and a disservice to the memory of a great baseball player.;0
11892;This film is a cringeworthy combination of nostalgia pandering and lazy merchandising. The plot is thin and uninspired, and the animation is lackluster at best. Only those with a deep attachment to the Care Bears from their childhood or a love for so-bad-it's-good movies might find some enjoyment in this mess.;0
11893;The Care Bears Movie is a disturbing blend of saccharine cuteness and creepy imagery. The characters are forgettable and the plot is nonsensical, relying heavily on nostalgia to make up for its lack of substance. It's a shameless cash grab that should be avoided at all costs.;0
11894;Watching The Care Bears Movie as an adult is a painful experience. The animation is dated and unappealing, the music is forgettable, and the plot is contrived and boring. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the Care Bears franchise, there's no reason to waste your time on this forgettable mess.;0
11895;I had high hopes for this movie, but it ended up being a complete letdown. Kenny Hotz and Spenny Rice had potential, but Spenny's lackluster acting ruined the entire film. The plot was weak and the celebrity appearances were underwhelming.;0
11896;What a waste of time. The only good thing about this movie was the brief appearance of Roger Ebert. Kenny Hotz's potential was completely overshadowed by Spenny Rice's terrible acting. The plot was uninteresting and the celebrity cameos were pointless.;0
11897;I couldn't even finish this movie. The acting was atrocious, especially Spenny Rice's. The plot was predictable and dull, and the celebrity appearances were forgettable. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
11898;I regretted every single minute spent watching this film. The plot is uninteresting, the characters are undeveloped and the cinematography is downright lazy. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
11899;This film lacks any substance. It's apparent that the filmmakers didn't have a clear direction or vision for the movie. The result is a disjointed, confusing mess that I couldn't wait to leave behind.;0
11900;I had high hopes for this film, but was left sorely disappointed. The script is poorly written and the acting is subpar. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, waiting for the movie to end.;0
11901;This film is a prime example of how a talented cast cannot save a poorly written script. Robert Taylor's performance as a bigoted buffalo hunter was uncomfortable to watch and the lack of character development made it hard to root for anyone. The writing was so stiff and uninteresting that even the beautiful scenery couldn't distract from the boredom.;0
11902;I cannot believe this film was made in 1956, it feels like it could have been made in the early 1930s. The writing and acting were both incredibly wooden, with the exception of Stuart Granger's performance. Robert Taylor's bigotry towards Native Americans was disturbing and made it impossible to sympathize with his character. The only redeeming quality was Lloyd Nolan's performance as the aging, drunken old-timer.;0
11903;Watching this film was an exercise in patience. The writing was dull and uninspired, the acting was wooden, and the portrayal of Native Americans was offensive. Robert Taylor's character was a one-dimensional bigot who was impossible to root for, even when he was facing the elements of nature. The only reason to watch this film is for Stuart Granger's performance, but even that is not enough to save it.;0
11904;The latest remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, DARAAR, is a complete disappointment. The direction by Abbas Mustan is horrible and fails to capture the essence of the story. The lead actor, Rishi Kapoor, looks too old and out of shape to play the lead role. While Juhi Chawla is decent in her performance, the regressive portrayal of the heroine leaves a bad taste. The climax of the film is also highly disappointing. The music is the only saving grace.;0
11905;DARAAR is a failed attempt by Abbas Mustan to remake SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. The story had potential but the direction and execution of the film are terrible. Rishi Kapoor looks too old and overweight to play the lead role, while Juhi Chawla fails to impress with her regressive character. Arbaaz Khan's debut is unimpressive and his terrible voice makes it even worse. The music is good but that's about it.;0
11906;SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY has been remade multiple times, but DARAAR is the worst of them all. The direction by Abbas Mustan is amateurish and does not do justice to the story. Rishi Kapoor looks unfit and is a poor choice for the lead role. The portrayal of the heroine is regressive and disappointing. The climax of the film is highly unsatisfactory. The only saving grace of the film is the music, but that is not enough to make up for the other flaws.;0
11907;I regret watching this awful film. The only thing that kept me mildly interested was the first scene. The rest of the movie was a complete waste of time. I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half watching Rishi Kapoor creepily pursue Juhi Chawla, who he was way too old for. The abuse and violence in this film made me feel sick to my stomach. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.;0
11908;Daraar is an absolute disaster. The first half of the movie is a snooze fest, and the second half is filled with gratuitous violence and abuse. I can't believe I watched Juhi Chawla get beaten up on screen. It was completely unnecessary and disturbing. The plot was weak and the acting was mediocre at best. I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this film.;0
11909;I wish I could unsee Daraar. The only good thing about this film was the first scene, which quickly turned into a mess. Rishi Kapoor was completely miscast and his pursuit of Juhi Chawla was cringeworthy. The violence and abuse in this film was completely unnecessary and made me feel sick. I can't believe I wasted my time on this terrible movie.;0
11910;This film is a shameless copy of Talia Shire's The Landlady. The plot is nearly identical, but with less interesting characters and a weaker storyline. The main character, Amanda Lear, is poorly written and lacks depth. The acting is mediocre at best and the film fails to live up to its potential. The only redeeming quality is the hot-tub scene, which is not enough to save this disappointing movie. 2 out of 10.;0
11911;The lack of originality in this film is astounding. The Landlady did it better back in 1998, and this film is a poor imitation. The plot feels recycled with uninspired characters and predictable plot twists. The only memorable scenes are the ones featuring gratuitous violence or nudity. Overall, this film is a waste of time and money. 3 out of 10.;0
11912;Do not bother with this film. The Landlady had the same plot over 20 years ago, and this film does nothing to improve upon it. The characters are forgettable, the acting is wooden, and the storyline is uninspired. The only thing that sets it apart from the original is the use of cheap shock value to keep the audience engaged. The hot-tub scene is the only thing remotely interesting about this film. Avoid at all costs. 1 out of 10.;0
11913;This film is an utter waste of time. The storyline is cliched and unoriginal, with no real depth. The lead actress tries her best to make the character likable but fails miserably. The brief nude scenes serve no purpose other than to titillate the audience. Avoid this film at all costs. * out of ****;0
11914;I cannot fathom how this film received any positive ratings. The plot is completely predictable and the characters lack any real development. The obsession of the protagonist with the married man is disturbing and sends the wrong message. The brief nudity is nothing more than cheap thrills. Do not waste your time on this film. * out of ****;0
11915;This film is an insult to the intelligence of its audience. The storyline is trite and uninspired, with no real surprises or twists. The lead actress fails to make any connection with the audience, and the supporting cast is completely forgettable. The gratuitous nudity is a desperate attempt to keep the audience engaged. I would not recommend this film to anyone. * out of ****;0
11916;The film was a complete waste of time. The plot was non-existent and the characters were uninteresting. The only reason to watch was for the promised nudity, but even that was disappointingly minimal. 1/10.;0
11917;I regretted watching this film from the very beginning. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, the acting was terrible, and the violence was laughable. It's hard to believe anyone actually greenlit this project. 2/10.;0
11918;I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. The cheap budget shows in every aspect of the production, from the shoddy camera work to the lackluster special effects. The only thing worse than the film itself was the wasted time I spent watching it. 0/10.;0
11919;This film is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible and the directing is amateurish. It's just another 'Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks' type of movie. The only thing that makes it slightly different is that it's actually shot in the South.;0
11920;The only thing remotely interesting about this movie is the story, and even that is bogged down by the bad acting and amateurish directing. The sheriff character is supposed to be a torn, creepy facsimile of a normal guy, but the acting is so bad that it just comes off as cringeworthy. Stay away from this one.;0
11921;I don't know how this movie got made. It's a blatant rip off of the shower scene from 'Psycho' and then just goes downhill from there. The girls' stop at a BBQ in South Carolina is just an excuse for the filmmakers to display some racism. The 'rape' scene is uncomfortable to watch and the use of a poorly researched Bible passage just adds insult to injury. Skip this one.;0
11922;This movie is an absolute disaster. The plot is unimaginative, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is wooden. The rape scene is not only gratuitous but also offensive. The ending is so bad that it makes you wonder if the filmmakers even tried to come up with something remotely satisfying.;0
11923;Watching this movie was a waste of time and money. The story is poorly developed and the acting is terrible. The rape scene is disturbing and serves no purpose other than to shock the audience. The ending is nonsensical and leaves you feeling cheated.;0
11924;Save yourself the agony of watching this movie. The plot is predictable and the characters are forgettable. The rape scene is gratuitous and offensive, and the ending is so bad that it's laughable. This is a movie that should never have been made.;0
11925;I couldn't even finish watching this movie. It was that bad. Sandra's attempts at humor fell flat and the plot was predictable and uninteresting.;0
11926;I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. It seemed like a jumbled mess of unfunny jokes and cheesy musical numbers. Save yourself the time and skip this one.;0
11927;I don't know how anyone could find this movie funny. It was painful to sit through and I found myself checking the time constantly. Sandra should stick to singing, because her acting skills are nonexistent.;0
11928;I thought Killer Tomatoes 4 would be a fun and enjoyable comedy, but boy was I wrong. The jokes fall flat, the plot makes no sense, and the tomatoes themselves are just not as menacing as they were in the previous movies. It's a shame that they had to ruin a perfectly good trilogy with this garbage.;0
11929;Killer Tomatoes 4 is a complete waste of time. The humor is cringeworthy and predictable, the acting is amateurish, and the special effects are laughably bad. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one.;0
11930;I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with Killer Tomatoes 4. It's not funny, it's not scary, it's just plain boring. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is uninspired, and the tomatoes themselves are more like props than actual threats. This is a definite miss.;0
11931;The film was a complete waste of time and money. The acting was atrocious, and the special effects were so bad that they were laughable. The plot was predictable and uninteresting, and the attempts at comedy fell completely flat. It's hard to imagine how anyone thought this movie was a good idea.;0
11932;I would not recommend this film to anyone. The characters were forgettable and one-dimensional, and the story was confusing and poorly written. The special effects were embarrassing, and the attempts at humor were cringe-worthy. Overall, a complete disappointment.;0
11933;This movie was a huge letdown. The acting was wooden and uninspired, and the special effects looked like they were done by a high school AV club. The story was nonsensical, and the attempts at comedy were painful to watch. Save your time and money and skip this one.;0
11934;I couldn't believe how terrible this film was. It was like watching paint dry, only less interesting. The acting was so bad that it made me cringe. I still can't understand how anyone could be associated with this mess of a movie. The story line was confusing and didn't make any sense. The only redeeming quality was the fact that it ended quickly. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
11935;I expected more from this film, but was sorely disappointed. The acting was wooden and the plot was non-existent. I couldn't understand a single thing that was going on. The characters were unlikable and the dialogue was stilted. It was like the filmmakers weren't even trying. I don't know how this was ever greenlit. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11936;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It was a complete waste of time and money. The story was dull and predictable. The acting was terrible and the special effects were laughable. The whole thing was just a mess. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie could be proud of it. I wouldn't even suggest this film as a last resort.;0
11937;I had heard so much about this film, but it was a complete letdown. The great cast was wasted on a poorly written and structured story. The lack of direction made the whole film feel like a mess, and it was hard to stay engaged. Avoid this one if you have any respect for your time.;0
11938;Despite the talented cast, this film falls flat on every level. The story is disjointed and confusing, leaving the viewer scratching their head throughout the whole experience. It's hard to believe that such a legendary director could produce something so lackluster. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.;0
11939;I went into this movie with high hopes, only to be sorely disappointed. The characters were poorly developed and the plot was all over the place. It's no wonder this film has been forgotten and never released on video. I would not recommend wasting your time on this forgettable mess.;0
11940;The film is an absolute waste of time, with terrible acting, corny and unrealistic cliches, and a forced drama that will leave you cringing throughout.;0
11941;Despite the promising premise, the film fails to deliver on any level. The acting is terrible, the story is full of tired cliches, and the overall experience is simply boring.;0
11942;This film is a complete insult to the audience's intelligence. The unrealistic and cheesy plot, terrible acting, and forced drama make it one of the worst films I have ever seen.;0
11943;This film is a complete waste of time. It's essentially a recycled plot from every other 80s sports movie, with gymnastics thrown in as an afterthought. The main character's 'stick-to-it-iveness' is predictable and boring, and the love interest is a cardboard cutout with no personality. The gymnastics scenes are unimpressive and lack any real excitement. Overall, a snooze-fest of a film.;0
11944;I have never been more bored watching a movie than I was watching this one. The storyline is completely forgettable and unoriginal, and the characters are one-dimensional. The gymnastics scenes are poorly executed and lack any real skill or athleticism. The love interest is just a pretty face with no real substance. The only interesting characters are the alcoholic father and big-haired stepsister, but even their storylines fall flat. Save your time and skip this film.;0
11945;This movie is a complete disaster. The lack of focus on the gymnastics is a huge flaw, and it's clear that the filmmakers didn't even bother to hire a competent gymnastics coach or choreographer. The main character's journey is unremarkable and unconvincing, and the love interest is a mere prop with no real purpose. The other characters are forgettable and uninteresting, and the attempts at humor fall flat. Overall, a poorly made film that is not worth anyone's time.;0
11946;Dream to Believe is an utter disappointment, not even worth the 99 cents I paid for it. The plot is unrealistic and poorly executed, with the only redeeming quality being Keanu Reeves' brief appearance. The film's DVD quality is abysmal, as it seems to have been copied from an old VHS tape. Avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11947;This film is a total waste of time and money. The story is unoriginal and predictable, leaving the viewer with nothing to look forward to. The acting is mediocre at best, with Olivia D'Abo failing to deliver a convincing performance. Even Keanu Reeves' involvement can't save this trainwreck of a movie. Don't bother wasting your time on Dream to Believe.;0
11948;Dream to Believe is a snooze-fest from start to finish. The gymnastics scenes are poorly choreographed and lack any excitement. The plot is dull and uneventful, with no real conflicts or resolutions. The DVD quality is atrocious, with the sound going out of sync towards the end. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even Keanu Reeves fans.;0
11949;I had the misfortune of watching this movie and was left feeling completely underwhelmed. It was like watching a low budget version of a high school musical. The storyline was predictable and uninspiring, and the acting was wooden at best. The soundtrack was a complete disaster, with cheesy songs that added nothing to the film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 1/10.;0

This movie was an insult to anyone with an ounce of taste. 1/10.;0
11951;I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. The storyline was trite and uninspiring, and the acting was simply awful. It was like watching a group of amateurs trying to make a movie. The dialogue was so bad it was almost laughable, and the music was nothing short of atrocious. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, under any circumstances. It's simply not worth the time or the effort. 1/10.;0
11952;What started as a promising and intriguing film, quickly devolved into a convoluted mess. The plot became muddled and nonsensical, with characters coming in and out without any real purpose. Not even the attractive lead could save this disaster.;0
11953;I had high hopes for this film, but was sorely disappointed. The pacing was off, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the acting was subpar at best. The attempts at humor fell flat and the action scenes were lackluster. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
11954;I can't believe I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. The story was unoriginal and predictable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the special effects were nothing to write home about. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy.;0
11955;I couldn't stand this film. It was a complete waste of time, and I regret even watching it. The storyline was dull and uninteresting, and the characters were bland and forgettable.

11956;Do yourself a favor and skip this film. It's a snooze-fest from beginning to end. The acting was subpar, and the writing was uninspired.

Overall, a forgettable film that I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. 3/10.;0
11958;This movie was a complete waste of my time. I expected to be entertained by James Cameron's reputation as a quality filmmaker, but I was sorely disappointed. The plot was convoluted and poorly developed, leaving me confused and frustrated. I couldn't even enjoy Jessica Alba's attractive presence on screen, since her character was flat and her acting was wooden. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11959;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a snooze-fest. The story was all over the place, and the action scenes were lackluster at best. I couldn't even keep track of what was happening half the time. Jessica Alba's performance was underwhelming, and her character was annoyingly one-dimensional. Overall, this movie was a major disappointment.;0
11960;I can't believe how bad this movie was. I was expecting something exciting and engaging from James Cameron, but instead, I got a confusing and boring mess. The plot was all over the place, and the action scenes were uninspired. Jessica Alba's character was a complete waste of potential, and her lackluster acting only made things worse. I would recommend avoiding this movie at all costs.;0
11961;This movie is a complete waste of time. The so-called action scenes are laughable and the plot is beyond predictable. It's like the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing and just threw together a bunch of cliches.;0
11962;I cannot believe how bad this movie was. The acting was terrible and the dialogue was cringeworthy. There was not a single original idea in the entire film and it felt like a cheap knockoff of every other action movie out there.;0
11963;I regret ever watching this movie. It was an insult to my intelligence. The attempts at humor were not funny and the action scenes were poorly executed. Save yourself the agony and avoid this movie at all costs.;0
11964;Dark Angel claims to be a sci-fi action film, but it's really just an excuse to parade a hot chick in shiny black leather and a big bike. With no plot, dialogue, character development, or anything interesting happening, this film is nothing but a dreary and formulaic mess. Watching this movie is like staring at a wall for two hours, except the wall is shiny and black and really boring.;0
11965;If you want to watch a film that's essentially a live-action anime without any action or life, then Dark Angel is the movie for you. With barely competent performances, tedious pacing, and a complete lack of humor, this film is a total waste of time. The visuals might be flashy, but they can't hide the fact that this movie is dumb and passionless.;0
11966;It's hard to imagine anyone actually enjoying Dark Angel. The film is a humorless and desultory experience that fails on almost every level. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and unexciting, the characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, and the plot is virtually non-existent. If you're looking for a sci-fi film that's actually engaging and thought-provoking, look elsewhere.;0
11967;This film is nothing but a glorification of a white German man, who is portrayed as a hero who has to drag his clueless American family around Europe to save them from the Nazis. The plot is convoluted and the characters are one-dimensional. The performances are nothing to write home about, with the exception of Lukas' Oscar-winning speeches, which seem like they were written by someone else. The film is patronizing and lacks any kind of nuance or complexity.;0
11968;If you're looking for a film that is dry, lifeless, and completely lacking in any kind of emotional or intellectual depth, then this is the film for you. The characters are wooden, the plot is predictable, and the dialogue is stilted and uninspired. Bette Davis does her best with the limited material she's given, but her character is little more than a prop. The children are grating and the supporting cast is wasted. This film is a snooze-fest from start to finish.;0
11969;This film is a perfect example of Hollywood propaganda at its worst. It's a heavy-handed attempt to teach the American public a lesson about tolerance and compassion in the midst of World War II. However, the film is so transparent in its intentions that it comes across as condescending and preachy. The characters are caricatures, the plot is trite, and the message is delivered with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Lukas may have won an Oscar for his performance, but it's hard to see why. The film is a disappointment on every level.;0
11970;This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is unoriginal and boring. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any depth. The acting is wooden and uninspiring. Even if you're a fan of the genre, you'll be disappointed.;0

11974;Save yourself the trouble and skip this film. It's a melodramatic mess that tries too hard to be important and ends up feeling like a bad history lesson. The acting is wooden and the story is painfully slow.;0
11975;I don't understand the praise this film gets. It's heavy-handed, overacted and manipulative. The filmmakers clearly wanted to pull at our heartstrings, but instead, they left me feeling annoyed and frustrated. This is a film to avoid at all costs.;0
11976;Watch On the Rhine is a film that tries too hard to push its political agenda and fails in spectacular fashion. The characters are one-dimensional and boring, the dialogue is mediocre at best and the overall tone is preachy and tiresome. The only redeeming quality is the acting, but even that is not enough to save this disaster of a film.;0
11977;I found Watch On the Rhine to be an insufferable bore. The film's attempt to promote a liberal point of view comes off as heavy-handed propaganda. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth, and the dialogue is bland and unoriginal. Despite the good acting, this film is a complete waste of time.;0
11978;Watch On the Rhine is a perfect example of how not to make a film. The characters are so poorly written that they come off as caricatures, and the dialogue is so contrived that it feels like the actors are reading off cue cards. The film's political message is shoved down the viewer's throat with no subtlety or nuance. The only thing this film accomplishes is making the audience wish they had chosen a different movie to watch.;0
11979;Stargate SG-1 is an absolute disaster of a show that fails to capture any of the excitement and wonder of the original film. The writing is lazy and uninspired, the special effects are cheap and poorly executed, and the performances are wooden and forgettable. It's a shameless cash-grab that tarnishes the legacy of the franchise.;0
11980;Watching Stargate SG-1 is like being stuck in a never-ending nightmare. The show is a tedious, monotonous slog that fails to captivate or entertain in any meaningful way. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the plot is derivative and predictable. Avoid this show at all costs.;0
11981;Stargate SG-1 is a prime example of how not to make a sci-fi show. The production values are abysmal, with cheap sets and laughable special effects that wouldn't look out of place in a high school play. The writing is lazy and uninspired, with characters spouting off technobabble and cliched dialogue that's impossible to take seriously. Save yourself the misery and skip this show entirely.;0
11982;This movie is a complete waste of time. It tries to be sci-fi, but ends up being boring and uninteresting. The characters are bland and forgettable, and the attempts at humor are painfully unfunny. The special effects are outdated and cheesy. To be honest, I don't know how anyone could enjoy this film.;0
11983;Save yourself the trouble and skip this movie. It's a poor imitation of other sci-fi shows, with nothing new or exciting to offer. The plots are unoriginal and predictable, and the characters are cardboard cutouts with no depth or personality. Don't waste your time on this boring and forgettable film.;0

This movie is a complete dud.;0
11985;I regret wasting my time watching this film. It's an insult to the original masterpiece. The acting was terrible, and the special effects looked like they were made on a budget of $10. This is not even close to SciFi, it's just a joke.;0
11986;I cannot believe how bad this film was. The lines were so cheesy and cringe-worthy that I had to look away from the screen multiple times. The characters had no depth or development, and the plot was predictable and boring. I would not recommend this film to anyone.;0
11987;I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The acting was wooden and lacked emotion, and the special effects were laughable. The story was unoriginal and poorly executed. I don't know how this could have been approved by anyone in the film industry.;0
11988;Terrible show. The lack of attention to detail is infuriating, they should have shot it in California instead of Canada. It's so obvious that it's a Canadian forest and not ancient Egypt. Richard Dean Anderson is a poor imitation of Kurt Russel and Michael Shanks can't make up for the rest of the terrible cast. Teal'c is an annoying robot and the fact that aliens suddenly speak English is laughable. Special effects are cheap and badly done, not worth the two million dollar budget per episode.;0
11989;Save yourself some time and avoid this show. It's poorly executed and the setting is all wrong. Canadian forests do not depict ancient Egypt. The cast is subpar, especially Richard Dean Anderson who falls short of Kurt Russel's performance. The effects are unimpressive and look cheap. This show is a disappointment and is not worth the two million dollar budget per episode.;0
11990;What a complete waste of time. The show is laughably bad, especially when it comes to the setting. The Canadian forest setting does not depict ancient Egypt and is jarring to watch. The cast is unimpressive, with Richard Dean Anderson being a pale imitation of Kurt Russel. The special effects are poorly done and look cheap. This show is not worth the two million dollar budget per episode and is a complete disappointment.;0
11991;The film's lack of attention to linguistic diversity is shocking. How can we believe in a world where everyone speaks the same language without explanation? It's lazy writing and ruins any chance of believability.;0
11992;The characters in the film are completely unrelatable. They go from strangers to leaders of different communities without any real effort. It's not believable and leaves the viewer feeling disconnected from the story.;0
11993;The lack of historical context in the film is disappointing. The visuals are generic and don't offer any real insight into the world or culture being portrayed. It's a missed opportunity to create a fully immersive experience.;0
11994;The film is an absolute disappointment. The story unfolds at a snail's pace, and the action scenes are few and far between. The aliens are completely unimpressive, and the CGI is laughable. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and their relationships are forced and unconvincing.;0
11995;Save your time and money. The film is an insult to the intelligence of its viewers. The slow pacing and lack of action are bad enough, but the film's attempt at romantic subplot is cringeworthy. The aliens are just silly, and the film's attempt at humor falls flat.;0
11996;I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. The plot is nonexistent, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is abysmal. The aliens are a complete joke, and the battle scenes are poorly executed. The film feels like a cheap knockoff of other sci-fi movies, and not a good one at that.;0
11997;The movie I watched was absolutely terrible. The plot was so convoluted that it made no sense and the story was a complete mess. I couldn't understand why the characters were doing what they were doing or what the point of the movie was. It was a total waste of time and money.;0

12000;Bait is a terrible movie with Jamie Foxx's hammy acting ruining every scene. He mugs so much that it's hard to watch, and his attempts at humor fall flat every time. The only actor who manages to save the movie is David Morse, but he can't do much against the terrible script and over-the-top villain played by Doug Hutchison.;0
12001;I couldn't wait for Bait to end. Jamie Foxx is unbearable to watch, mugging and doing silly voices that are more annoying than funny. Even Mike Epps is better than him in this movie, and that's saying something. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, and the action scenes are the only redeeming quality, but they're not enough to save this disaster.;0
12002;Bait is a complete waste of time. Jamie Foxx's overacting is painful to watch, and his incessant attempts at humor fall flat every time. The villain played by Doug Hutchison is cartoonish and ridiculous, and the plot is so convoluted that it's hard to follow. The only good thing about this movie is David Morse's performance, but even he can't save it from being a complete disaster.;0
12003;This movie was a complete waste of time. The storyline was slow and boring with no real plot progression. Jamie Foxx's acting skills were underwhelming and his performance was forgettable. The only redeeming quality of this movie was David Morse, but even he couldn't save it from being a complete disaster.;0
12004;I have never been so disappointed in a movie in my life. The characters were one-dimensional and the acting was terrible. Jamie Foxx seemed completely disinterested in his role and gave a lackluster performance. The plot was predictable and unoriginal, making the movie feel like a complete waste of time.;0

However, it's not enough to save this dull and boring film from being a complete waste of time.;0
12057;The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance? More like The Bloodsucker Puts the Viewer to Sleep. This movie is a complete snooze fest. The murder mystery is barely existent and the characters are so one-dimensional that you'll forget their names as soon as the credits roll. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
12058;I've seen better acting from a middle school drama class. The voice dubbing is so bad that you'll be laughing for all the wrong reasons.

More like The Bloodsucker Leads the Audience to a Terrible Movie Experience.;0

Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
12069;This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is nonexistent and the acting is terrible. I would rather stare at a blank wall for 2 hours than watch this movie again.;0

12073;I cannot believe I actually watched this film from beginning to end. It was a painful experience that left me feeling robbed of my time. The story was unoriginal, the characters were flat, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. A rating of 5 or 6 is far too generous.;0
12074;I regret ever hearing about this film, let alone watching it. The marketing must have been the only good thing about it because the actual movie was trash. The pacing was slow, the cinematography was uninspired, and the music was forgettable. A rating of 5 or 6 is inexplicable.;0
12075;This film is a disaster. It tries to spoof classic 50s 'alien invasion' films but fails miserably. The direction is sloppy and the comedy is witless.

12077;I can't believe I actually sat through this entire movie. It's a painful experience from start to finish. The so-called 'spoof' is nothing more than a lazy attempt to cash in on a tired genre. The direction is uninspired and the acting is forgettable. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it will make you appreciate good movies even more. (*1/2);0
12078;I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. The dysfunctional family plot was predictable and boring, and the murder and mayhem felt forced and uninspired.

The only redeeming quality was that it was so bad it was almost funny, but even that got old pretty quickly. Don't waste your time with this one.;0
12081;As a historical drama about Artemisia Gentileschi, this film fails miserably. It sacrifices accuracy for cheap thrills and sensationalism. The only redeeming quality of the film is its decent production values and costumes.;0
12082;It's disappointing that this film attempts to pass itself off as a biopic of Artemisia Gentileschi, when it's really just a mediocre romance novel with a historical setting. The inaccuracies are so glaring that it's hard to take the film seriously. The only thing that saves it from being a complete waste of time are the beautiful sets and lighting.;0
12083;This film is an insult to the legacy of Artemisia Gentileschi. It's clear that the filmmakers were more interested in creating a sappy romance story than accurately portraying the life of a groundbreaking artist and survivor. The inaccuracies are so numerous that it's difficult to take the story seriously. The only redeeming qualities are the decent costumes and some well-crafted lighting.;0
12084;I don't know what movie the critics were watching, but this film was not only inaccurate, but also boring. The plot dragged on and on, and the characters were one-dimensional. Not even the great acting could save this disaster of a film.;0

12087;Artemesia is a disappointing film that turns a potentially fascinating historical biography into a soft-porn fantasy. The portrayal of the protagonist as a man-hungry person is not only inaccurate but also offensive. The male lead who played her teacher is unconvincing and lacks the charisma to make the audience believe in their relationship. Overall, the film is forgettable and fails to do justice to its subject matter.;0
12088;Artemesia is a tasteless film that tries to spice up a dull story about the art world with sex and scandal. The protagonist is portrayed as a one-dimensional character whose only motivation seems to be her obsession with men's bodies. The acting is mediocre, and the male lead is particularly unappealing. The film is a missed opportunity to shed light on an important historical figure and her struggles.;0
12089;Artemesia is a shallow film that reduces a complex historical figure to a caricature. The use of sex and scandal as a plot device is cheap and unoriginal. The protagonist's supposed independence and ambition are undercut by her relentless pursuit of male attention. The film could have been an intriguing exploration of the art world and gender roles, but instead, it is a forgettable and uninspired mess.;0
12090;This movie is a confusing mess. The characters' motivations are unclear and the plot is convoluted. It's like a soft porn version of a legal drama, but with no real substance or meaning.;0
12091;The acting is the only redeeming quality of this movie, but even that can't save it from being a complete waste of time. The story is contrived and the characters are unlikable and poorly developed.;0
12092;This movie is a prime example of style over substance. The beautiful women and handsome men are just a distraction from the fact that there is no real plot or direction to the story. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
12093;A disastrous film that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's astounding that anyone thought this was a good idea to make. The story is so far from reality that it's laughable. The acting is wooden and uninspired. The only thing worse than the script is the pacing. The film drags on and on, making you wonder when it will finally end. The only good thing about this film is that it ended.;0
12094;A terrible film that should never have been made. The filmmakers took a fascinating subject and managed to make it boring and unwatchable. The dialogue is stilted and awkward, and the actors are clearly struggling to make something out of nothing. The film is a complete mess, with no clear direction or purpose. It's hard to believe that anyone involved with this film thought it was a good idea.;0
12095;An abysmal film that is an insult to the subject matter. The filmmakers took a compelling and inspiring story and turned it into a dull and lifeless mess. The pacing is sluggish, the dialogue is wooden, and the acting is uninspired. The filmmakers seem to have no understanding of what makes a good film, and have managed to create a film that is both boring and offensive. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs.;0
12096;This film is an insult to Artemisia Gentileschi's legacy. Instead of portraying her as the strong and independent woman she was, the director turns her into a helpless victim of male oppression. I cannot believe they would turn such an inspiring story into a sappy romance.;0
12097;What a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing a powerful and gritty depiction of Artemisia's life, but the director decided to focus on the romance between her and Tassi instead. It's as if they completely missed the point of her story and reduced her to a love interest.;0
12098;I cannot recommend this film to anyone. The director's decision to turn Artemisia's story into a cheesy romance is not only disrespectful to her legacy but also makes for a boring and unoriginal movie. Save your time and watch a documentary about the real Artemisia instead.;0
12099;This film was a disaster. The filmmakers did a terrible job of telling Artemisia's story and instead reduced her to a pitiful, helpless woman with no agency. It's sexist and insulting to portray a strong historical figure in such a weak way. The film is also historically inaccurate, completely distorting the true events of Artemisia's life. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this trash.;0
12100;Save your money and skip this film. The portrayal of Artemisia is a joke. She's depicted as a shallow, sexualized character with no depth or complexity. The filmmakers clearly had no understanding of the real Artemisia and instead chose to create a caricature of her. The historical inaccuracies are also frustrating and distracting. Don't waste your time on this garbage.;0
12101;This film is a complete disappointment. The filmmakers completely missed the mark when it comes to Artemisia's story. They turned her into a one-dimensional, sexualized character with no real agency or complexity. The historical inaccuracies are also egregious and make it clear that the filmmakers didn't do their research. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this film.;0
12102;This movie is a complete disgrace to the real Artemisia Gentileschi. Not only is the portrayal of her life completely inaccurate, but the film completely disregards the fact that she was a victim of rape. The graphic sex scenes are just a way to distract from the fact that the filmmakers failed to do any research on this amazing artist.;0
12103;I was appalled by this movie. The filmmakers completely butchered the story of Artemisia Gentileschi. The film portrays her as a seductress who willingly enters into a sexual relationship with her rapist, when in reality she was a victim of a horrific crime. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for distorting such an important story.;0
12104;This movie is an insult to the legacy of Artemisia Gentileschi. Not only is the story completely inaccurate, but the filmmakers completely gloss over the fact that she was a victim of rape. The graphic sex scenes are just a cheap ploy to distract from the fact that the filmmakers failed to do any real research on this incredible artist.;0
12105;This movie is an insult to the real Artemisia Gentileschi and her legacy. The script is cringeworthy, the acting is forgettable, and the cinematography is mediocre at best. The only redeeming quality is some decent set design, but even that cannot save this trainwreck of a film.;0
12106;I cannot believe I wasted my time watching this pretentious, poorly written movie. The filmmakers clearly prioritize cheap titillation over actual character development or storytelling. The distorted-lens effects are laughably outdated and add nothing to the film. This movie is a disgrace to the historical figure it supposedly represents.;0
12107;I have never been more disappointed in a movie than I was with this one. The inaccurate portrayal of Artemisia Gentileschi is offensive, and the attempts at eroticism are crass and unnecessary. The script is so bad that it feels like a parody of arthouse films. Do not waste your time or money on this mess.;0
12108;This film is a disturbing portrayal of an underage girl having a sexual relationship with a man old enough to be her grandfather. The French seem to have a fixation on this kind of perversion. Valentina Cervi is beautiful but looks like a child, and the actor playing Tassi looks like a creepy old man. The film ignores the real life story of Artemisia, a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of the 17th century, and instead turns rape into a romance, which is sickening.;0
12109;I cannot believe that a female director would make a film that glorifies the sexual exploitation of a young girl by a much older man. The film has no regard for the real life story of Artemisia, a talented artist who deserves to be remembered for her achievements, not for a twisted and perverted version of her life. This film is a disgrace.;0
12110;This film is a shameful and disturbing portrayal of a young girl being taken advantage of by an older man. The French seem to have a strange obsession with this kind of twisted story. The film completely ignores the real life story of Artemisia, who was a talented artist and the first woman admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy. Instead, the film focuses on a sickening romanticization of rape, which is disgusting and completely insensitive to the real Artemisia and the horrors she faced.;0
12111;The film 'Stardust's Rebellion' suffers from the same myopic desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it forgets to have an actual story. The plot is so poorly constructed and convoluted that it's nearly impossible to follow, and the attempts to tie everything together in the end only make things worse. The theme of rebellion against authority is so heavy-handed that it becomes almost comical, and all the characters feel like nothing more than cardboard cutouts. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.;0
12112;I had high hopes for 'The Last Light' but unfortunately, it falls prey to the same flaws as other films that prioritize an ending or message over a compelling story. The plot jumps around so much that it's hard to keep track of what's happening, and the characters are so poorly developed that it's impossible to care about them. The theme of survival in a post-apocalyptic world feels tired and clichéd, and the ending is so predictable that it's not even worth watching until the end. Don't waste your time on this one.;0
12113;'The Lost Heirloom' is a perfect example of a film that forgets to have an actual story in its quest to convey a message. The plot is so contrived and nonsensical that it's hard to take anything that happens onscreen seriously, and the characters are so poorly written that they might as well not exist. The theme of family and tradition is so heavy-handed that it becomes grating after a while, and the ending is so unsatisfying that it feels like a slap in the face. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this film at all costs.;0
12114;The movie was a complete waste of time. The storyline was ridiculous and unbelievable. The characters were weak and uninteresting. Not even Kay Francis could save this disaster of a movie.;0
12115;I cannot believe Kay Francis agreed to be a part of this terrible movie. The plot was nonsensical and the characters were poorly written. There was nothing redeeming about this film.;0
12116;I was extremely disappointed by this movie. It was slow, boring, and lacked any real substance. Kay Francis may have given it her all, but it wasn't enough to save this trainwreck of a film.;0
12117;This film is an absolute mess. The plot is so convoluted that it becomes nearly impossible to follow. It's as if the writers just threw in any idea they could think of and hoped it would somehow come together. Unfortunately, it doesn't.;0
12118;I found myself constantly checking the time while watching this film. It felt like it went on forever, and not in a good way. The story is all over the place and none of the characters are particularly likable. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this one.;0
12119;The acting in this film is subpar, at best. Kay Francis does her best with the material she's given, but the rest of the cast falls flat. The story is incredibly far-fetched and I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this film.;0
